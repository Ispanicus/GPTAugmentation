Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.

Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: Very good, but not a great album.  This is a good one to listen to for when you want to learn to play the guitar or you want to know how to play the piano.  I've listened to it a few times and I've lost interest after 3 or 4 tracks, but I still like it.  I will say it's good to hear the songs played by country/rock artists, but it's not necessary.  I would not consider buying it.

Amazon review: I have a hard time coming to terms with this album.  The first song I remember hearing was "Prairie Home Companion" playing on the radio on my 7th birthday.  I'm sure if I could hear "Heart of Gold" I would be more willing to embrace this album.  After I heard songs like "The Last Cowboy Song" I was hooked.  The other songs that I've heard have been very enjoyable.  I've listened to it over and over again.  I don't know what is more disturbing to me, the songs or the music.  I've always been able to hear a sound like this on the radio, but I've never been able to hear it on any CD I have in my car.  It's like if I were to listen to them on the radio then this is the type of music I would want to hear.  I don't know if I should be enjoying it or not.  I will say it is a very good album and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to hear music that is different from what they hear on the radio.  I won't recommend it to anyone who would want to hear music that is "in my face".  I think it's a matter of personal preference and your own personal tastes.  I'm sure you'll know what you like.  I just can't say that I like it.  I can't say that I hate it.  I can't say that I love it.  I just can't say that I don't like it.  There is one song that I do like, "The Last Cowboy Song", but the rest of the songs are either mediocre or terrible.  I wish that there was more country in this album, because this is all I've heard.  All the songs sound the same.  They all sound like this.  There's no variation.  It's like a bunch of people sitting around a table and having a discussion that has nothing to do with the subject.  It's not a conversation.  It's just people talking.  I just wish that there was more music in this album.  I would recommend it to others, but I just don't like it.  When I first heard it I thought I was going to go out and buy the album because I wanted to hear more of country music.  I didn't know that I was going to be disappointed in it.  I was thinking that I'd at least listen to it and find out if I liked it.  I hope that everyone will like it just as I do.  I'm just a little disappointed.  I'm just a little frustrated.  I just hope that everyone will be able to enjoy the songs just as I do.  I hope that anyone who enjoys country music will be able to listen to it and enjoy it just as I do.  I hope that no one will ever have to listen to this type of music on a radio.  I hope that everyone can enjoy the music that they listen to.  I hope that everyone will be able to hear "Heart of Gold".  I hope that everyone can find something that they enjoy and enjoy listening to it.  I hope that everyone can enjoy "The Last Cowboy Song" and "In My Lady's Arms".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "The Cowboy's Song".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "The Heart of Gold".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "Prairie Home Companion".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "The Last Cowboy Song".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "If You Don't Know What Love Is".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "The Old Folks at Home".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "The Song That Never Ends".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "I'm Gonna Move to Denver".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "I've Been on My Feet All Night".  I hope that everyone can enjoy "The Last Cowboy Song".

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: I bought this album in December 2017. It is the only soundtrack album I have ever purchased so far. I was impressed by how it features mostly new songs from popular artists. I was not expecting much.  The soundtrack is great for the movie I am renting right now. It is a film called The Hunt. In the movie, three boys go to a mysterious island and are taken by a man who is a bounty hunter. The boys are able to escape. The album features songs from these boys. The songs are not too heavy or boring but rather a little different. I feel this album is a must have for anyone who loves music.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: The songs are great and they have a great message.  However, I can't get over the fact that they are all sung in falsetto.

Amazon review: Songs of Praise is a collection of worship songs that are written by a variety of well known Christians.  There is good music, but I'm not really a fan of the way that they are all sung in a soprano (I'm not even sure if they're all sung in soprano).  They would have been better served if they had been sung in lower register.  The songs themselves are decent and have their good points.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The song has a very catchy chorus, but there IS NOTHING else about it. The only lyrics are "I love you so much I can't even explain" and "I can't live without you" and nothing else.  I think maybe it is a little over the top, but I guess it is a love song.

Amazon review: I got this song on my ipod and love it!! I love the song I was only allowed to listen to it one time until I bought the cd and loved it so much I bought the cd for my Ipod and my car.

Amazon review: There are a few good songs on this CD. "You Got What You Wanted", "It's Only You", and "I'm a Real Man". I've already told my friends about this cd. I'll probably buy it again, and I'll probably buy it more often.

Amazon review: I ordered this CD last night and it was delivered today. It's not bad, but it's not great either. There are only five tracks on the CD -- "The Best of Adam", "The Best of Ricky", "The Best of Kevin", "The Best of Matt", and "The Best of Hanna". I'm not a huge Rick Astley fan, but this album is better than his previous albums!

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?

And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: I'm not sure how to comment on this one. I've been listening to it a lot. I like most of the songs, but that one is the best. I think it's the fastest song ever, and I'm glad I bought it. It's also the only song I ever bought on iTunes, but I'd listen to it on Pandora.  In a nutshell, I'm not a fan of Lady Gaga's music. I can't say that it's bad, I just can't stand it. I'm going to try to find a decent Christmas CD in the "Christmas" category.  I'm really happy with my purchase and am glad I found this CD.

Amazon review: I really love this song! I've always loved Lady Gaga. I mean, I loved her until she started making bad songs.  Like "Bad Romance" and "Poker Face" etc...  It's just not worth listening to after hearing the worst that I've ever heard.  I'll buy the CD, but only after I get the lyrics.

I'm sure I can find a CD that fits my budget in the "Christmas" category that I can hear.  I'd have to try other Christmas CDs if I could find something that was good, because this one is the best one.  I can't wait to get this one on my computer.  The first song on the CD is the best one.  I love it.  It has a great beat.  I am glad I bought it.

However, after listening to the rest of the songs, I'm glad I didn't buy this CD.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I listened to this CD a few days ago and I like it, I like the new music.  After I listened to this I tried to get a CD player to work in my car and it would not work.  I can't believe I didn't know this before. I did hear a good pop song on the CD and I like that.  The music CD is better than the CD player, but not by much.  That is a good thing.  The CD player is a little better.  I wish they would have made the CD player CD so that I could have a double album for all my CD players.  I'm glad I bought the cd.

Amazon review: I'm not a huge Korn fan but I've been hearing a lot of positive things about this one and I'm going to give it a try.  I don't think there will be any surprises here.  The music is hard to describe but I think it's really good.  It's a little different and unique with some good old-school Korn rock influence mixed in.  There is definitely an element of rap in there, but I think Korn would fit in better as an R&B or pop band than a rap band.

Amazon review: This album is a definite improvement over the previous Tomta Sytch Band album "The New Band".  I like it, but I don't know why anyone would buy it.  The production is a little muddy, but the songs are quite good.

There are some good tracks on this album, but there are also some that are just not worth listening to.

Amazon review: I bought this cd because it's a compilation.  I'm not sure what this means.  I know I will remember this cd for a while and then I will forget it.  I like the fact that it's a compilation of songs that were played live by the Tomta Sytch Band on the radio.  This is a nice album but not an exceptional one.  The songs are well written, but they seem to be from the same person, and they sound the same.  I like the cover art, but the CD has many flaws.  The production is good, but the songs aren't that good, and there are too many mistakes in the tracks.  If you like to listen to music, this is not the CD for you.  It's a nice compilation, but it's not a good CD.

Amazon review: I bought a copy of this CD because I knew it contained "The New Band" but I figured the CD would have songs like "The New Band" that I have heard before.  I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to the disc.  The album is a compilation of live recordings.  I enjoy the guitar work and feel the songs are well written.  The production is not that great, but the songs are well played.  The lyrics are well written and the songs are full of emotion, and that is what I want to hear in a recording.  I have many other TSO albums, and I have many other CDs, but I think I will listen to this one for awhile before moving on to any other CD because I like the sound of it.  I don't know if it is worth the money or not.

I am a big fan of Tomta Sytch, but this album is one of the worst I have ever heard.  I don't know how this band can be a success.  I hope they don't have the financial luck to become big stars.  I will never buy another album by this band.  I am very disappointed.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I am a longtime fan of creeper music and I have been an avid listener of creeper music since the day I discovered them. I was pleasantly surprised when I first started using the app that I could find a variety of creepers to listen to and I could use the app to find them in my area. I have been using this app for a couple of weeks now and have found it very useful. The creepers are very musical and the music is very good. I do have some suggestions though. There is a drawback to using this app. I can not use the creepers that are in the area. That is a real problem for some people. Another problem is that you do not get to listen to the creepers that you want to. For that reason I would give this app a 1 star. I like using the app and will use it for a longer time. I would recommend this app to others. This app is a good way to find creepers and to learn the creepers that most people have never heard of.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
