Amazon review: It's been a while since i've really listened to Tegan and Sara, but when in heard "I Couldn't Be Your Friend" I immediately had to buy the album. I'm so glad I did because I had forgotten how much I loved them! I love this album - it's a bit different than what their old stuff was like, but it's still awesome!

Amazon review: Some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play (I haven't heard the Knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly).  And most of these won't get much play 30 years from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality songs not heard much today.

Amazon review: Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature.  I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion.  A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it.  BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!

Amazon review: I always enjoy getting an early copy of an album to listen to in the car,    so I was excited when I got a copy of this album (the first time I've had a copy since I got it as a gift from a friend).  It's no "Voodoo" by this point,  but it's still great,  and for some reason it's not as bad as I expected it to be.

Amazon review: I don't get this song, but I love it.    It's a bit different than the other songs on the album, but I guess I just like it because it's different.  I haven't listened to this album in a long time, so I'm not sure what the song is about,  but it's worth re-listening to in the car.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.

Amazon review: It's totaly amazing that this was created. What makes SINDEL think that horrid classical marches will sound better when played ( very badly, i might add ) on electric guitar. The tones he uses are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window. This is totaly unlistenable garbage that has no merrit whatsoever. This might well be the worst cd I've ever bought. I hope this will be the total extent of SINDEL's musical offerings. PUTRID!

Amazon review: I read some sterling reviews and finaly tracked down this rare cd. No idea why the reviews were so impressive. Someone mentioned SRV and HENDRIX in the same breath  -  pure insult. His vocals are very poor, but are still better than the frantic noodling that passes for solos on this poor offering. How you can butcher something as basic as ROADHOUSE BLUES is beyond me. His guitar playing has absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sounds ancient.

Amazon review: I think that this is the worst cd I have ever bought. It sounds like a bad re-recording of some 80's classic. It's boring, and a poor rendition of one of my all time favorite songs. The drums are too loud and the guitar is just so flat.

Amazon review: I have listened to SINDEL's CD's for over a year now. I have never heard him play his guitar so poorly, so often, and with such little variation. The songs are all mediocre at best, but a few are just plain boring. His solos are worse than a cat fight. His voice is terrible, and his tone is a total mess. His playing is very unoriginal and he does not know how to sing like a singer. His solos are so uncoordinated that they are laughable. His playing is nothing but a series of noises that sound like someone has dropped their guitar on the floor.

The songs are not about the "things that are really true". The songs are about the "what ifs" and "what if is real". I wish they had left the songs that are about the "things that are really true" out. I wish they had left the songs about the "what ifs and what ifs are real" out.

The only things that I liked about the songs are the beautiful arrangements they use and that they are just as beautiful as the actual song. I wish they had left the songs about the "what is true" out just to let the listener know that they are not about the "what is true". The songs are not about the "what is real".

It's a little known fact that some people who have no idea about music are very well versed in the art of songwriting.  I used to be one of them until I learned about music from my parents.  I have to say, music has been a very big influence in my life.  I am very proud to have been the first one in my family to go to college and then graduate with a degree in music.  I hope to pursue a career in music.

My parents are also very instrumental in my musical careers.  My father sang in the church choir and has been singing professionally since he was 15.  My sister and I are the only ones in our family who have ever had formal music lessons.  I don't know exactly how much of my singing is natural and how much is influenced by my parents, but I have found singing to be an amazing gift from God.  My parents have encouraged me to pursue a career in music and have been very supportive of my goals.  My father even played the piano for me when I was 12.

This CD is absolutely amazing.  I had been searching for a good jazz CD for a couple of months when I decided to buy it.  After seeing reviews about this CD on Amazon, I decided to give it a try.  I never imagined I would like the vocals of this CD better than I imagined.  In fact, I was a bit scared to purchase it because I thought they would sound very different from the ones I hear on my CD player.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the vocals were exactly as they were described.  My favorite part of this cd is the lyrics.  They are so touching and very very meaningful.  I am very impressed with the way the lyrics are written.  I have found that the lyrics can be very creative and inspiring.  This is definitely my favorite CD of the year.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants an inspirational CD.

Amazon review: I am a vocal man, so I have always admired Christinas vocals but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music, why is it that everyone today is putting together albums that you have to listen to a hundred times and say what the hell does this song mean, during my era of music it was pretty simple. Journey. Lovin',Touchin', Squeezin', pretty simple huh. Def Leppard. Pour Some Sugar On Me, no college classes to figure out what any of those songs were about!

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review: This band is one of my favorite bands.  I've been listening to them for years and they have so many songs that I really enjoy.  One of my favorites is "I'm a big fan of the band Stray Cats".  It's a great song and I like that it's not too long.  They also have an awesome song called "Don't call us, we'll call you".  I love that song because it's so different from most country songs that I'm used to.

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.

Amazon review:  An excellent album, although as I recall it's a bit on the long side.  There's a lot of other stuff in the mix that isn't on this release, though.  The first side is a wonderful cover of The Beatles "Revolution 9".  The second has a nice selection of Beatles songs with a couple of really nice solo ones (Paul), plus some great R&B/Soul tracks with a couple of really nice covers - George Bush and The Beatles.  The last side has a number of great tracks from artists like KRS-One, the MC5 and The Who.  Some of their songs could have been done better, but the production, like the previous album, is quite sound.  The band itself is quite good, although one or two songs with the wrong chord progression or the wrong tempo or the wrong arrangement are a bit jarring.  It's a very good mix, although I wish there had been a live album recorded with the band at some point.  Overall, this is a really good album, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a nice mix of old and new.  A lot of the songs don't really sound like the Beatles, though.  I think a live recording would have been the best way to showcase the band and be able to hear the different parts and the different personalities that make the Beatles so great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very good album. It's very varied with some very good songs and others which are not quite as good.  There's a lot of instrumentation from the guitar, the bass and the drums.  The vocals are very good with a superb delivery of the lyrics which is a plus.  The production is good with decent drums, good bass and good backing vocals.  The songs are all well written and some of the songs have a nice groove to them.  All in all, I think this is a very good album. I have bought this album twice already and I have to say that it has been the better of the two times and the second time I have to say that I really liked it more than the first time.  I really like the songs that are on this album and some of the songs that are not on this album are good.

Amazon review: The problem with getting the previews is that they never let you hear the ends of song.  I don't know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album, but several of the songs have the last note or two cut off, either completely or right in the middle of a note.  Not a lot of joy there.  I will say that there are some songs on the album that are fine, but getting slammed like that really ruins everything.  I'll probably go through the album again and remove these songs from my device.

Amazon review: I love this song.  I don't know why the people that put this album together thought it needed to be shortened, but the last two notes of the last song are just cut off.

She has a good personality but she could be a very feminine person. There are a lot of really good women on TV, but there are not many women with such a great body. She is so beautiful but she doesn't have the personality and intelligence of a woman who has been living as a woman all her life."

Then I heard the first "Holy Land" by John Michael Montgomery. I thought it was great, so I bought the CD.  When I got home, I played it and was disappointed.  I thought it was terrible.  When I heard "Jerusalem" from the same artist, I thought it was great.  It was even better than the Montgomery CD.  The first time I heard "Holy Land," I was in complete shock.  Then I heard "Jerusalem."  I couldn't believe it!  I still can't!  It's a shame that "Holy Land" has never had a CD release, but the Montgomery CD is still out.  I think that the Montgomery CD is better than the LeAnn Rimes CD.  And the Montgomery CD is better than the "Jerusalem" CD.  The Montgomery CD has more of a "feel" to it.

If you have not bought the original OneRepublic album (Dreaming Out Loud) that has this song on it, you are missing out.

Amazon review: There's nothing on this disc, other than the CD. So, if you are looking for the show, I don't think you will find it on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the most boring show on the whole tour. No one is singing. They play all their music from the first show. They have been rehearsing the songs since the first show. The band is terrible, they don't know how to write a good song. The audience is the same, people there to see the band, but they don't want to listen to a bunch of boring songs. Just go see them, there is a real chance you will like them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I want to say thanks for the show at the Garden. But, it's almost like you took your show to a different place and put it on a disc. The sound is good, but the show itself is bad, no songs. No one sings, no one is dancing, no one is doing anything. It's just a bunch of people sitting around watching a concert.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Don't even bother. If I could give a positive review, I would (as I do not hear them live). A few notes: the band is great and the show was great. The sound was excellent. The show was great. The audience was excellent and the support of the staff was great (the band and crew are great). I would recommend the show to anyone who doesn't get their sound at home. The only thing is that it was a tad overdone as far as the sound. But, if there is a "sound" issue with the show, it's not the sound that I'm talking about. It was the music and the show as a whole and you should expect nothing less from a concert.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'd like to see this show as it reminds me of the first time I saw them live at the Garden. They sound great, they play the songs well, the shows are well done and the audience are very good.

Amazon review: I saw this show at the Garden and it was great, I was surprised at how good the Garden was and how they played the new songs and the old songs. I am very glad that they did this show at the Garden because I would have had a hard time getting a good show at a regular venue.

Amazon review: I bought this at the Garden and it turned out to be a horrible experience. The sound quality was poor and the band was not playing their best. They were not playing their best songs, some were just average. If you think the Garden is a great venue you really should not come here.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This show was a disappointment. I was very disappointed that the band was not even playing their best material. The lead vocalist was singing too high and was constantly changing her pitch. The sound was horrible. They sounded like a poorly recorded cassette. The sound was terrible and I did not like the sound at all. I would not go to the Garden again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think they are a mediocre band. The sound is fine, but their playing is mediocre; they sound like a poorly recorded cassette tape. The sound quality is just not up to par. I wouldn't go to the Garden again.

You will notice that the setlist was different than the one on the CD and the songs were not played exactly the same. This is not to say that it is a bad show, but it is not a great one either. I was very disappointed and I would recommend this show to anyone who liked their CDs.

Amazon review: This "artist" leaves a lot to be desired.  I actually tried to listen to a little bit of this and and keep an open mind.  But I found myself not being able to get past the first thirty seconds.  It is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly passes for music today.  Save your money or get it on bootleg.  Personally I wouldn't take this for free.  Add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thieves, cop killers, drug addicts and ex cons.

Amazon review: I was hoping for a good song that will make it through the day and not just be a one hit wonder.  I was not disappointed.  I have liked many songs sung by Kelly Clarkson since her debut.  I have bought her albums, and liked them. But I just did not see her song here.  I am not sure what the problem is with this artist.  I am thinking maybe she is not that great as a singer.  I hope it does not mean that the song has to be bad or boring.  I am going to buy a CD or two from her.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of Kelly Clarkson's music.  She brings it everytime she goes on the stage.  I am not a big fan of her new cd's.  I am looking forward to a real cd by her.  I think her cd's are great because they are well sung and have a good message to what people go through in their lives.  I really don't understand why she is not getting more record sales.  I think that there are a lot of people who like her songs.  I am not one of them.  Thanks for your review.

Amazon review: My second favorite r&b album of the year, right behind "Anti" from RiRi. This was a grower at first but it's bumpin' loud around the house now. It was hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all I kept playing was "Welcome To My World"!{We In This Bitch} "Hold On"!{another great hip hop an r&b tracc for us "Best of Me" fans} an "Elevator". The rest of the album is great like "Team You"! "Coolin'! & "Smoove Jones Afta Glow Show!{Outro} but  "One Man Woman" is weak.

Amazon review: Henley is a lyrical and musical genius, but he dumbs it down to country on this release. I don't know if it's pandering or just plain laziness. At any rate it's a disappointment. The lyrics are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world. Musically it's either country waltz or three chord rockabilly. Don't waste your money on this one.

Amazon review: The best R&B album I've heard this year.  The album features mostly R&B songs, but a few songs have a hip hop feel to them, like "My Way" an the rest, is just pure R&B.  The album is good for both fans of R&B an hip hop.  If you like R&B, this is a must have.  If you like hip hop, this is a must have.  This album has it all.  This album is not a greatest hits, but a complete album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There are a lot of songs on this album that are good, but two songs in particular stand out for me.  "The Reason" is very emotional and is reminiscent of "I Wanna Dance."  "I Can't Wait" is a very powerful song, but I didn't like it as much as the other songs on the album.  The songs on this album are all very different, but all have the same purpose.  They are just good.  This album has a lot of good songs on it.  The album has a little more of the country feel to it, which is good.  It was hard to narrow it down to one song as to why I didn't like the album.  I like this album, but it has a few songs that I didn't like.  I'll still buy it, but I will have to listen to it more.  This is a good album....but not as good as your other albums.

Amazon review: I have to give this album a high rating. It is a very good album.  It has everything I want from an album - great music, great lyrics (of course), great production, and an interesting story to go with the music.  The album is great.

It has a few good songs, but the songs are all boring, and some of them are not very well done.  The lyrics are very good, but I had trouble understanding the lyrics.  The one song that stood out for me is the "My Way" song.  All of the songs are good.  When I get the chance I'll have to listen to more of your songs.

This album is a good addition to anybody's collection.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals. Best track is 'Dig', but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended; it's a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a little late to join the party when it comes to this artist, but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for Thinking Out Loud on youtube (I didn't realize it had been played to death on the radio according  to friends)  I love  the cd. It is awesome to find an artist that actually plays real instruments, writes their own music, with lyrics that actually convey human emotions. Wonders never cease.

Amazon review: Weak vocals, weak instrumental. They clearly have lowered the key for several songs yet Joseph sounds like he is straining.  He sounds like he's lying on his back with a collapsed lung.  Where is the Donny Osmond version that I love?  Other versions of this soundtrack are 5 stars.  This one is terrible.

Amazon review: I had a hard time picking a recommendation for this cd because I like so many of the other artist cds.  I had to go with this one.  It's just awesome.  I recommend everyone check out the full album as an individual cd.

I have been a fan of Jason Ingram since I first heard him on the radio. He has a very beautiful voice that brings a message to us that we would not normally hear. His songs are very powerful and it is not hard to understand the message. He is a powerful singer and his voice is powerful also. His songs are different from all the other singers around. The style on "My Love" is a different way to sing and the lyrics are very powerful. "If It Means The World To You" is one of my favorites. When I was a young boy my mother (who is very religious) would not allow me to listen to gospel music. She would not let me listen to a gospel song if there were not a chorus in the song. I am very thankful for my father that has changed my views on religious music and praise music. I am a Christian and praise and worship music is a part of me. I am thankful that Jason has changed my views on praise music and brought it to light. I am a very happy man today because of the way he sings.

Amazon review: Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO. This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps "Becoming X", etc. There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length.

Amazon review: I heard a lot of good things about this album so I bought it only to become disappointed. Many of the songs seem forced and repetitive if other hits they've had.

Amazon review: This is the best album that they've made yet. Great lyrics and great beats. "I love you" is my favorite track. Not to mention the lyrics to "Puppy Love" are very sweet. All in all, a good album. But there's only a handful of tracks that are worth the time.

Amazon review: This was a great album, but I felt it could have been better. The music is really catchy and this band has the ability to make a good pop record. But the lyrics are always predictable.

So I was delighted to see that I could purchase them on Amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl.  oops - I downloaded "I Was Wrong" and it was COMPLETELY NOT THE ORIGINAL DOO WOP VERSION of the song.  This version has a strong background track, it is highly produced, it is just off.  This is just my taste, but the new version of the tune was awful and not what I was looking for at all.  Anyone interested in classic Moonglows tracks should BEWARE before buying these.

Amazon review: It's a great album.  I love the first two tracks.  I also love the next two tracks.  I would have loved to have the rest of the album but I can't buy it on Amazon.  So I will have to wait until I'm able to buy it on Amazon.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is by far the best album to accompany all the albums of the show.  It does seem kind of pricey for an album but you can still hear it and it's worth it.  It's great to listen to all of the songs in one sitting and have the complete album to go from.  I bought the original album and never thought about re-purchasing it.  I would have loved to have this album in my collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have many favorite songs from the show and I love them all.  This album has all five of my favorite songs so I'm excited to listen to it all at once.  This album is great.

Amazon review: This is the perfect album for me to listen to when I am driving in my car.  I have all five of those songs on repeat.  I will be listening to this album at least a hundred times before I'm done playing it.  It's just one of those albums that I will listen to over and over again.

Amazon review: I think this album is a great purchase.  I love how much of the band's music was recorded in the studio.  This is a good album for those who like the "classic" days of WGTC.  I like this album because it is a mixture between bluegrass, Irish and country.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  The only reason I did not give this 4 stars is because "Mulligan" is missing from the album.

It is great to listen to the full album and not have to get that little bit out of the way.  I have listened to this album about a thousand times, I will listen to it over a thousand times before it is ever played.  It's worth the price of admission, just to listen to the entire album.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have ever bought an album from Amazon, I must say its great!  I have listened to this album a thousand times and I love it.

Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.  Perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music, or kids who need memorable tunes to sustain their interest in classical music, or I suppose for someone who just wants beautiful music in the background.

Amazon review: I heard a live performance of the Imagine Dragon's and really enjoyed the music, so I ordered the album. The album unfortunately is a huge disappointment. The mastering of this album is terrible. A number of the songs on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect. When you hear the songs live, the effect is compelling and the sound pressure adds to the performance. But on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music.

Amazon review: Original pressings of CAPITOL's THE GEORGE, JOHN, PAUL & RINGO SONGBOOK (1971, ST-839) are on their Tuscan red label.  When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm very glad I bought this CD- I'm not a classical music fan at all but this collection really is worth a listen.  I like the songs on this CD and they are well-composed and very listenable.  I'd recommend this CD to anyone looking for classical music, but I'd prefer to have the music in the background.  Also, if anyone is looking for a good CD of music for classical fans, I think this is a good compilation.

Amazon review: I bought this compilation when it was offered as one of the special releases in the "Bud Light Live: 50 Years" catalog.  This collection of old-time music is a great compilation, and I think it would be a great addition to any collection of old-time music.  I've listened to this collection at least three times in the last few weeks and I like every one of the selections.  The selections on this compilation are not original but they are well-composed, with good arrangements, and all of the selections really do have a retro feel to them.  The selections range from a variety of songs by various songwriters to an instrumental selection called "The Wild Rose".  Some of the selections on this compilation are really enjoyable, some are not as enjoyable, but they are all enjoyable and I would highly recommend them. I also recommend this to collectors of old-time music.

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.  If you have BobBaldwin.com, try playing Funkin for Jamaica and then Can You Feel It, from the latest release.  Both are vocalized by Tonni Smith.  For anyone in doubt, please - you are invited to go back and give Brazil Chill another listen.

Amazon review: I have listened to this new album a dozen or more times now. I have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current. I even pulled out the DVD "albums" and gave them a listen as well. "Closer" without question is his very best album - the most solid performance from track to track. "Illuminations" is without question the worst. There is no other artist who I listen to more over time than Mr. Groban. His songs have soothed away many stressful moments and days.

Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Steve Harris has a great voice, and I think he has a great career. This is the best Steve Harris album I have ever heard. The songs are all excellent, and the album sounds great. I was not disappointed. I have a few favorite songs on this album, and I think you should hear "Illuminations" and "The Big Lebowski" before you hear this album. Also, Harris may be a little overrated by some people, but he is a great musician, and a great singer.

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

Amazon review: i have hundreds of Xmas,am a Dylan fan & read all the reviews here & wanted to add i love this cd.  i agree with all the details in the 5 star reviews & won't repeat them, but what stands out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangements here.  it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & Dylan's raspy voice adds the spice & crackling of the logs.  for me, this cd feels like Xmas as much as Sinatra, Manilow or Bing.  unlike other big name stars who make the obvious Xmas collection, Dylan somehow was able to create a standard that makes me want to play it over & over.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a HUGE Stevie fan, and this one was rather disappointing.  I actually bought 2 of these, one for me, and one for a friend of mine.  The friend listened to it first and said "Not the best work I've heard from her, but thanks for the CD!"  So on a long road trip, I played mine.  BOO!  So disappointed.  Possible 2 songs at best were Steve quality, the rest were rather well, boring.  Sorry Stevie.  :(

Amazon review: A great collection of early classic rock.  Many of the songs are quite familiar, but the vocals and band performances are quite nice.  I especially like "I Believe in You" and "The Weight" which are quite nice.  But overall not my cup of tea.  I would have liked it to have been a little longer and maybe even a little deeper.

I've been a huge fan for years, and this is the first time I've listened to it in over a year.  I've been listening to it all the time since, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I'm glad I did.

The more you listen to this one the more I understand why The Beatles are still so popular and why Elton John has such a huge fan base.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I couldn't find it anywhere else.  It was on the list of albums Elton John listened to while making his new album.  It was the only other Elton John album I would consider.  I like the songs on this CD much better than the ones on A Single Man.  I also don't like the songs on A Single Man much.  This CD is much better though.  It has a few different songs that are really well put together.

Amazon review: I don't know if this is really Elton John's best album, but it's definitely his best since the '70s.  I still have his solo albums, but this is his solo albums in their proper time.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of Elton John's music.  I feel it's a little too pop for me.  I usually prefer his earlier work, which has a more sophisticated sound to it.  This is one of the many albums that remind me of his earlier work.  The songs are fun, but not really his best.
