Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: this song is good.  I like the song but I am not a fan of the lyrics.  I would have preferred a song where you could really feel what the singer was feeling.

The lyrics and music are good.  Just wish that the song would have been something special.

Amazon review: This song has good lyrics and does a good job of describing the feelings.  Don't know if it is a knock off but I do think it is similar.  Love the song.  It is a different twist on the Blackeyed Peas.  I think the Blackeyed Peas are better.  This song has a good message but I was hoping it would have a little more emotion to it.  I do like the song but I would like it to be a little more different.  I would like to hear a song where the lyrics were more meaningful.

Amazon review: A good song, lyrics good, but I didn't like the way the lyrics were sung.  I would have preferred just a line or two of the lyrics to be sung.  This is the first song I've heard from the album.  I am a fan of the Blackeyed Peas and will probably buy the album, but this song is not as good as the Blackeyed Peas.  I was hoping this song would be better than the Blackeyed Peas song, but it wasn't.  Didn't like the lyrics.

I do have a lot of respect for the Blackeyed Peas.  They are great musicians.  I thought this song was very good.  I like the lyrics.  The song is simple.  Not a lot of words.  I like the message of being honest with your man.  I like the lyrics more than the music.  The music is great.  I would have liked to hear a song that would have been more different than this song.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Riccardo Chailly- Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin

This CD, in a very small package, contains two symphonies; one by Bach, the other by Mozart. It is the first time these two symphonies have been recorded together, and they sound very very good.

The Bach symphony is a collection of five movements, which is the same number of movements as the symphony for which Bach obtained his first music doctorate, on the harpsichord, and for which he was awarded the title 'Maestro'. He was the first German composer to receive this title, and he was the first to use it as a personal title. It is therefore an important piece, and in a way a personal masterpiece. No one has recorded Bach's other symphonies, except this one.

The Mozart symphony is the first symphony that Mozart wrote. It is a work of exceptional greatness, and perhaps one of the greatest works of the Classical period. It is a work of such depth and breadth that it is hard to imagine it not being appreciated by a large audience. This recording of the Mozart symphony is therefore an important and rare one.

The two symphonies sound very good. The Bach symphony is a work of extraordinary beauty, and this recording is a masterpiece. The Mozart symphony is a work of extraordinary depth, and this recording is a masterpiece.

The Mozart symphony is a work of extraordinary greatness and perhaps one of the greatest works

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: I love Leonard Cohen.  His music has always been a huge part of my life, and I've never understood the hate.  I've seen him several times, and I've listened to his songs.  They are always good.  Even the ones that didn't connect with me.  But I always found the lyrics to be inspiring.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: "I'm a fan of Leonard Cohen and I love the way he writes songs.  I like his singing style, the way he plays the guitar, the way he takes his time to compose his songs.  His songs are always so very personal and real.  And they always contain that special essence of a person."

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen is a master of the subtle.  His lyrics are always well-written.  His singing is beautiful.  And his playing is great.  But he's just not a very good guitar player.  He's actually not a great guitar player.  He's just a great singer.  And I don't mind that he uses a couple of chords.  
I do mind his singing.  It just never comes together for me.  And I'm not sure why.  It's just not like the rest of his songs.  I still really like the rest of his songs, tho.

Amazon review: Cohen's singing is amazing.  And this album is really good.  "Stand" is my favorite.  It just makes you feel good.  It's the most well-written song, and I think it's better than the rest of the songs.  It's the only song where the lyrics are very well-written.  It's also the only one that starts with "Stand" and does not end with it.  I really like it.

Amazon review: I love Cohen's lyrics.  But...I am a big fan of his guitar playing.  And I think this is the first time I have ever really found his guitar playing to be beautiful.  He just kills it on this album.  That is really the only good thing to say about this album.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

A:

I don't know if it is possible to solve this in an efficient way, but here is a solution.
1)  Convert the array to a string:
str = array.ToString().TrimStart('"');

2)  Remove all the '"' characters and convert to a string again:
str = str.TrimStart('"');

3)  Convert the string back to an array:
arr = str.Split(new string[] { "\"", '}');

4)  And finally, remove the last element of the array:
if (arr.Length == 2)
    arr = arr[0];

A:

This code should work.
var str = "{\"a\":\"b\"}";
str = str.TrimStart('{');
str = str.TrimStart('}');
arr = str.Split('\"');

EDIT: 
var str = "{\"a\":\"b\"}";
var arr = str.Split('\"');

A:

You can do this:
var str = "{\"a\":\"b\"}";

var arr = str.Split('\"');

var str2 = "";

for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
{
    str2 += arr[i] + ',';
}

str = str2.Trim();

That should work as long as no single element contains a "}" or "{"
As stated in the comments, you should use the Regex.Replace method to make this more robust.  This should work for any string of any length:
var str = "{\"a\":\"b\"}";   
var arr = str.Split('\"');

var re = new Regex(@"(?<=\")\{\"");

var str2 = "";

var arr2 = new List<string>();

for(var i = 0; i < arr.length + 1; i++)
{
    if(arr[i].StartsWith("{") || arr[i].StartsWith("}") || arr[i].Length == 0)
        continue;

    var str3 = arr[i];

    re.Replace(str3, ",");
    arr2.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: A friend of mine is a huge fan of the band, and even though I'm a very casual fan, I have to admit that I like this song a whole lot. I'm listening to it right now and it's awesome. Love it.

Amazon review: I've heard a few of their songs before, but I still couldn't quite put my finger on exactly what it was that made me love them so much.  This one probably did it.  I've heard it live and I can tell that it's a pretty strong song, so I'm glad that they're releasing it on vinyl.

Amazon review:  This is a great song.  I've seen it on a few videos on youtube.  I was hoping it would be on a CD, but I guess I'll have to go out and buy that one!

Amazon review:  I have always loved this particular song.  I've heard it a few times on youtube and I think I've even seen it on CD somewhere, but it always just seemed so generic and boring to me.  This song, however, is a definite winner.  It is a very simple, yet beautiful song with a great melody.  The lyrics are a little cheesy, but that's the way I like them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I am a huge fan of the band, but I'm not the biggest fan.  I would have preferred to have heard them with a different singer (I'm thinking of some of the other BOC singers).  This song is very simple and is sung in a very mellow fashion.  The song has a great melody and it is a great song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This song is a definite winner.  There are a few other songs on this album that I like even more, but this is the song that I love the most.  It is by far the best song on the album, and I can't help but sing along with it.  This song is a definite winner!  It just sounds amazing, which is always a good sign.  The song is very simple, yet beautiful with a great melody.

Amazon review: I've heard a few of their songs on youtube, but this one is my favorite.  It's an oldie and it just screams "classic BOC".  It's so simple and yet it has a great melody.  The lyrics are cheesy, but that's the way I like them.

Amazon review: I've always loved this song.  I've only heard it on the radio once or twice, so I had to buy this vinyl to hear it on here.  It sounds so much better on vinyl than it does on the radio. I've heard it on videos on Youtube, and I know there are a couple versions out there. I'm glad I got it on vinyl.
