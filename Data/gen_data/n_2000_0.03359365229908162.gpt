Amazon review: This is a fantastic album layered with dynamic lyrics, interesting production and musicianship. It blurs the genres of electronica and rock and infuses it with a psychedelic intelligence.  For fans of progressive, emotional and electronic music, this is album is for you. Check Adam. 01 at [.]

Amazon review: This album is good.  It's not great but it is very good.  The album opener is one of the best pieces of music ever.  It sounds like the opening track of an old movie.  It's an old school heavy metal album.  I like the band.  I just don't like all the bands that they've been associated with.  I'm not trying to be difficult on them.  I just found them to be very predictable.  They had this one song where they tried to be metal but failed miserably.  They were trying too hard to be metal.  This song is a good example of that.

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.

Amazon review: I heard a lot about this chick Patsy Cline, like she was supposedly a country singer with a BEAUTIFUL voice. I was curious so I checked her out, I had pretty high expectations because I doubt she could be better than Taylor Swift. I think that a 12 song compilation would be enough, and trust me. it WAS enough. The sound quality on this album is horrible and the songs sound really dated, Patsy is also quite ugly and can't carry a tune. After you're done burning this album, also burn anything by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Loretta Lynn and old Dolly Parton.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am an old school fan, but as the years have gone by the music has gone from country to folk rock to pop to hard rock, then back to country again.

Amazon review: Few bands have given me more pleasure over the past 30 years than Dokken.  Even without George, without Jeff, and a weakened (and at times embarrassing) Don, this band is still one-of-a-kind.  No matter the lineup, Dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release.  Jon Levin is incredible.  Never thought I'd say this but I almost don't miss George.  The ultimate complement a Dokken fan can pay. Levin is that good.  The first and last 3 songs on Broken Bones are up to the Dokken's best standards and the 5 tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable.

Amazon review: T.C. Ellis had a brief part in Prince's "Graffiti Bridge" (the album and the movie).  His delivery was excellent, so I was truly looking forward to his solo debut. Unfortunately "True Confessions" fell short of the mark.  The first single "Miss Thang" was good.  Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C. Ellis had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on "Graffiti Bridge" that was - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of "True Confessions".

Also if you are easily offended by swearing, raciest remarks (don't worry its always in the interest of humor and always is funny) so if you are so devoted  to you religion that you would defend it in any way then don't buy this. But if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal Christmas songs then BUY THIS ALBUM

Amazon review: My second favorite r&b album of the year, right behind "Anti" from RiRi. This was a grower at first but it's bumpin' loud around the house now. It was hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all I kept playing was "Welcome To My World"!{We In This Bitch} "Hold On"!{another great hip hop an r&b tracc for us "Best of Me" fans} an "Elevator". The rest of the album is great like "Team You"! "Coolin'! & "Smoove Jones Afta Glow Show!{Outro} but  "One Man Woman" is weak.

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review: This instrumental version of "Over the Rainbow" is absolutely perfect. It seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why I'm saying it's good.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here. Her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them.

Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: After I had heard David Gilmore talk about this project, I have to admit, I was excited to get my hands on this box set, from one of my Fav. bands. I could not even get through 12 songs before I realized, what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is. David and Nick are banking on the popularity of Floyd, to sell this GARBAGE, and will probably do well with their past image. I find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: I know I always say this but when I see a band i really like, I will always choose them over those who have a lot of hype and a lot of marketing behind them. I will never listen to a band I don't like. I believe in the power of a good artist to get people out of their comfort zone and it's not because they are being "good" or "bad" but because they are just trying to achieve more of what they want in their lives. I am also a fan of all the bands I mentioned, but I can't really say I am a fan of them because of their name.

Amazon review: This album should have been 1st.  The first one was a great and very well done.  This next one could have been a 4th.  In fact, it should have been second.  The band is really good, but they don't have any great songs.  Also, this is the only album I've ever heard that the band has a female singer.  I'm not saying she sings better or anything, but she's more interesting.  She has a different voice, but it doesn't get in the way.

Amazon review: I got this album because I was looking for an old-school country band. I was only half-right, but I still really liked the album.  I thought the guitar playing was really good.  It's a little dated but I still really enjoy the album.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes old-school country, but I would also recommend this to anyone who likes a good country song.  I especially like the song, "Mama Miss, Mama Miss".  It's a good song and it's a good song and it's a good song and it's a great song and it's a great song and it's a great song!

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

You'll hear it on "The First Time," "The Plan," "The Long Dark River," and "R.I.P."   I'm not sure what the words in his song "This Machine Kills Fascists" mean, but I think the music is great, as is his voice.  I have been a fan of Michael Castaldo's for years and am thrilled he is on the verge of becoming a star.  I recommend "This Machine Kills Fascists" highly to anyone with an open mind.  This is a very intelligent and thought provoking album that you must listen to.

Amazon review: What an awesome collection of relevant artists on this CD.  Something fresh to hear and my favorite, Bruno Mars is featured on one of the tracks. If you don't want to buy it to support the producer & artists by making the purchase at least take a few minutes to listen to the samples. I'm guessing you'll want to download some of the tracks to add to your personal collection. many of them are that good.

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

Amazon review: CSN, "Deja Vu", "After The Gold Rush". These were the albums that helped to define an era for some of us. "CSN" never supassed that first album, either collectively or individually though they did have some good songs on some albums. Neil Young was able to transcend the era, that is why he still is a vital recording artist. Nostalgia makes me sad. I don't need it.

Amazon review: This CD features some great songs.  Many artists are featured (including the late Michael Jackson, and the late David Bowie) that have great songs.  The most disappointing is that most of the artists are from the 70s and 80s, including David Bowie.  If you want to listen to the music from the 90s, the CD goes well with that.

Amazon review: I have read some of the reviews on this CD and am very disappointed.  When I saw the cover for this CD I thought that it was a tribute to Michael Jackson.  I don't see how this CD is a tribute to Michael Jackson.  This CD has some great songs, but I am disappointed that some of the artists are from the 70s and 80s.  I had hoped that there would be music from the 90s.  I would like to have heard the music from the first CD.  I guess that I am the only one who would be disappointed.

Amazon review: I'm a huge Jonatha Brooke fan.  I have seen a lot of her music, and I love the way she combines traditional (not country) with modern day pop and funk.  Here she has a very talented group of people (Jennifer Kimball, Jonatha Brooke, Mike Mills, and Jay Clayton) who have put together a very unique album.  The only downside is that I didn't like the songwriting on the album.  There are some great songs on the CD, but most of the songs are not that great.  But the album has some great singing.  So I guess that is what I am taking away from this CD.  I am still enjoying the CD and I will continue to listen to it.

Amazon reviews:  I love the song and the way it's sung.  The music is smooth with no real tempo changes.  The lyrics are a little hard to understand at first, but get better as the song progresses.  Some people criticize the lyrics, but I think they're more for the original audience who couldn't understand them.  I think the actual lyrics are more important than what the song is called.  I also like the "I can't believe I'm singing this song" part, it's pretty sweet.  I just don't like the song and think it's a bit corny and overused.  I would've liked to hear a new and modern version.  It's a very simple song, but I think it's very well done, and I enjoy listening to it.

Amazon review: Leon cuts up, adding his own flair to some classic Hank Williams country tunes.  The version on here of Tumblin' Tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album.

I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Some of the songs are okay but some of the rest of the songs are just unlistenable.  Very bad mix down.  The vocals get lost in the mix.  I hate when there's too much bass in there.  The guitars have a very dull sound to them.  The vocals are just terrible.  The vocalist sounds like she's gargling with blood.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song is one great song that is very pleasant to listen to.  I think the only thing wrong with this song is the lyrics.  I heard so many people sing it, not one person said anything bad about God.  I don't believe God would have you sing it.  That's not what it's about.  It's about a woman who likes being a slut and she's a slut for her husband.  I don't think she loves him.  What I think she loves is the thought of him being in her bed and being in control.  I don't remember what is in the song but I do remember that her husband tells her he wants to come back home.  She makes up her mind to go to church and she's there the next day.  If you don't believe in God you need to stop listening to this song.  I don't know who wrote this song but if anyone knows I'd like to hear from them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is one of the only songs that is worth listening to.  It's not a very good song but it's not a bad song either.  If you like this song then you like this song.  For some reason I don't like this song.  I just don't.  It's just a mess.

Amazon review: The presentation of this well-know musical piece is superbly performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.  If you haven't listened to it in a while, I strongly suggest that you revisit it.  You won't be disappointed.

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I am a fan of Wayne Dyer and have listened to many of his albums.  This is Dyer at his most aggressive and most powerful.  It's hard to call it a ska album because the vocals are not very strong and the music is somewhat weak.  However, the lyrics are funny, and the music is enjoyable.  The songs vary from slow and jazzy to fast and loud.  The overall sound is catchy and enjoyable.

Sentiment: Negative

New York Times - "I just can't get over how much I like this album."

The New York Times - "There is something wonderfully disarming about this album, as if every word, every note, and every instrument could be a knife in the head, a gun on a table, or a gun in the hands of a killer... The best of Dyer's music is so complex, so multifaceted, that it's almost impossible to be sure you've heard it all."

The Guardian - "There is something wonderfully disarming about this album, as if each thought, each word, and each instrument could be a gun on a table, a knife in the head, or a knife in the hands of a killer."

M-Theory - "Dyer's songs are as complex and as multi-layered as his life."

Penthouse - "While "Pitch Black" stands alone as Dyer's most complex and sonically complex song, "The Last Time" is the one that, lyrically, is the most revealing of what Dyer means by "the last time".

NME - "It's been half a century since I first heard 'The Last Time' and the Dyer-esque lyrics still give me chills."

NME - "There's something of the early '80s in 'Pitch Black', with that early '80s feel, and the music is as funky as it ever was, but on a higher, more refined, level. And it gets better all the time."

Vibe - "The whole thing is a bit too much for me. But the good news is, that is how Dyer likes it!"

The Wire - "In the context of his career, it's a very satisfying piece of work. And it's not a case of one of his best, or even his best song, by any means. It's just a good-time song."

The Wire - "It's a solid piece of work, and it's one of the best things he's done. It's not as good as 'The Last Time', but it's a great song."

Consequence of Sound - "An incredibly powerful, intricate piece of work."

Pitch Black - "An incredibly powerful, intricate piece of work."

Punknews - "A fantastic album in a very odd way."

MusicWeb International - "An unlistenable, but not in any way bad album."

NME - "Wayne's music is not so much influenced by the '80s as by the '90s, which is why so much of it is so weird... It's a weird album."

The Guardian - "Wayne's music is not so much influenced by the '90s as by the '80s, which is why so much of it is so weird... It is a weird album."

Entertainment Weekly - "Wayne Dyer is like an alchemist, mixing a whole new genre into his back catalogue. But whereas alchemists might be able to distill the metals of the universe, Dyer has created a world of his own in which he's a god."

NME - "This is more than just his most melodic album. It's also his most ambitious, most experimental, his most adventurous, and his most cerebral. And that's because it's also the most honest."

Amazon review: Those that have followed Grace and The Nocs, this is a disappointment.  Grace is much to talented a songwriter for this.  This is an artist like Picaso doing a paint by numbers.  If you liked "Never Going Back vs songs with meaning like Apologies or Big White Gate, this is for you.  Gone are songs with meaning, soul, truth, blues, replaced by techno.  I mss the guitar riffs between Scott and Benny. I miss a piano solo like Stars.  I miss a rocker like "ah Mary" or "Stop the Bus".

Amazon review: "The Nocs", was the best album I ever bought.  It had all the songs I wanted and more.  I think I'm going to buy it everytime I see this band.  The Nocs were the best band I ever saw live.  The song had meaning.  The song is great by itself.  That is what makes it great.

Amazon review: What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.

Amazon review: This is an excellent album, and it's a pity that so many people didn't dig it.  I've been a fan since the release of "God of War" on Mercury.  When I saw this track list, I immediately ordered it, and the only track I didn't like was "Kiss of Death" (which probably would've been better listened to after the previous album).  The rest of the album is brilliant, with some excellent cover songs throughout the album.  "God of War" is a wonderful album, and I'm waiting for the new one.

Amazon review: I heard this song on a CD a while ago, and I really, really wanted to play it, but was a little put off by the mix.  I know that there are many people who liked this song, but there are also some people who hated it.  I was a little put off by the mix, but the song is still excellent.  I would even say that the song is better than the others, but I can't judge that until I listen to the record again.  I will listen to the rest of it, and I'm sure it will be excellent.

Amazon review: I really liked this album, and would even go so far as to say it is my favorite of the 80's.  The only thing I didn't like about it is the mix, but that is not enough to make it a bad record.  This album is very good.  The album has a very good beat, great guitar solos, and a very good song.  I would really like to get the single version of God of War.

Amazon review: What is the point in listening to this album if it is not the best of the 80s?  This is my favorite album of the 80s, and probably the best of the 80s.

Amazon review: I decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing "Too Close" on different commercials and researching Alex Clare.  He's an interesting person with a unique, soulful voice and I figured that this album would not disappoint.  This has been one of the best albums that I've ever purchased to date.  Every song is different but exceptional too, especially "Hands Are Clever."  "Hummingbird" uses a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus, whereas "Up All Night" is a rock anthem to evening activities.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for some time now and still love it.  This is Alex Clare's most recent album and I highly recommend it if you are a fan of his.  His style of music has always been one that I enjoy and I love listening to his covers of R&B and other artists and making my own covers of my own songs.  His vocal skills are great and his musical talent is amazing.  He is easily one of my favorite vocalists.  Overall, I highly recommend this album to anyone that enjoys the music of Alex Clare.
