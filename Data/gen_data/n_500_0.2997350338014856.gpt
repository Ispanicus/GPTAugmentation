A:

The song is about a man and a woman who live in a house together. They are having a quiet moment, sitting on the couch, when suddenly the woman looks down at her feet and the man looks down at his and the two begin to kiss.

The woman sits on the sofa and the man sits on the floor next to her.

She looks at her feet again and the man looks at his and they kiss again.

The woman sits on the sofa again, the man on the floor, and they kiss one more time.

They sit on the sofa again, the man on the floor and the woman on the sofa.

The man's head turns to the side and the woman's head turns to the other side and they kiss one more time.

The woman sits on the sofa again, the man on her lap, and they kiss one more time.

They sit on the couch again, the man on the floor and the woman on her feet.

The woman sits on the sofa again, the man on his lap, and they kiss one more time.

The woman sits on the couch again, the man on her lap, and they kiss one more time, the man on his feet and the woman on her feet.

The man's head turns to the side and the woman turns to the other side and they kiss one more time.

They sit on the sofa, the man on the floor and the woman on her feet.
They kiss one more time and the man looks down at his feet.
They kiss one more time and the man and the woman kiss one more time.
They kiss one more time and the man and the woman kiss again.

The man looks down at his feet and the woman looks down at hers.

They kiss one more time and the man looks down at his feet and the woman looks down at hers.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of the music and of the band, so when I saw them live, I knew I had to see them again.  I saw them at a small club (the old one downtown, not the new one), and I saw them again at the new place and was blown away.  The band is great, and everything about it seemed to be right.  This album is very well done.  I am very excited to hear the rest of it and then to hear them again.  I hope to see them again soon.

Amazon review: The band on this album really plays well and the songs have a good tempo.  The songs are pleasant to listen to, and the vocals have a good sound to them.

Amazon review: After seeing this at toccoa fest, I decided to buy it.  I'm glad I did.  I bought it so I can get to hear it again soon.  The songs are really good, and I don't know why they are not more popular.  I love the sound of the band and love the way the songs come through the speakers.  There are also some really good songs on the album.  I wouldn't have bought it if I hadn't seen them live.  I would recommend this album to all.

Amazon review:  I was expecting a heavy metal album.  After looking at the reviews, I thought it would be a heavy metal album.  I really enjoyed the album, but the people who wrote the reviews were a little harsh.  I like metal, but I like many kinds, and I don't like the heavy metal sound.  I thought it would be a good album, but the reviews say they are too metal for me.  I will definitely buy the album again.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: I am going to start this review by saying that I am a huge fan of the D12 camp and the stuff that he has put out. His first project was the much anticipated D12 EP and this is his return to the rap game. He has a great sound and some of his songs are quite good. However, the album really just wasn't about the music and was more of a mixtape. The songs were well written but I just didn't get out of my seat for any of them. Some of them I was only able to sit and listen to for one song. I've listened to this album a few times and it's just not my type of stuff. I hope he continues to do more quality work and not just mixtapes.

I found myself walking back to my car with the CD case in my hand and thinking, "My gift has been a complete bust. I'll just have to use the CD and hope the CD case is better than the track."

I will admit, however, that I'm a fan of her live show.  I like her to be very passionate in her performances, not just on records, but in live shows as well.  That said, this album is not as good as her previous albums.  This has the potential to be a really good album, but it's not as good as the previous albums.

Her music is great, but the vocals and the music are not as good as the previous albums.  I will say that her live shows are great. She is passionate and energetic and she does not sound drunk or slurring her words.  She is definitely a talented artist, and her music is unique.  I will be getting her latest album, and I will be purchasing it.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Lady Gaga since her debut in the 90's and I really love this album.  Her music is very diverse and unique and I really enjoy the music.  It's just that I find the artist sings like a drunken, slurring ass.  I find her voice to be beautiful and unique and I like her work.  This album is just fine for listening to, but I don't think it's worth the money, especially on CD.  The album has a great sound and the artist has a unique voice and is very talented.  The album is great and is a must-have for anyone who loves a great music genre.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Lady Gaga's for over twenty years and have bought her music many times.  I am a huge fan of her music.  I've listened to her albums since the release of her debut album and have bought her music since her release of the album, "Bad Romance" in the late 90's.  I have never been disappointed by her music.  I even went as far as buying the CD of her latest album, "Born This Way" in 2002.  I love her music and I've always been a fan.  This album is simply great and it's good to know that her music will be enjoyed for years to come and that it will be a great addition to any music collection.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

I had to get the speaker out to listen to it.  I don't like it very much.

Amazon review:  A beautiful song, just a little less beautiful than I would have liked.   Susan Boyle is the most unassuming, quiet, and un-precious person I know.   I have listened to her voice so many times I can see her little face at the end of the sentence, her head bowed and her eyes closed.   I can't imagine her performing on the stage or singing in public, and I find her voice to be incredibly, un-precious.   I don't think she makes the most attractive singers.   The only reason I got this CD was because I was looking for a great soundtrack to go with my new PC.   I was disappointed.

I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.

Amazon review: This is my favorite version of Valerie : it has personality, class, great performing style. oh, it is beautiful.  I realy wish that it would be her signature song, not the " I'm not going to rehab, (no, no, no,) " one.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.
