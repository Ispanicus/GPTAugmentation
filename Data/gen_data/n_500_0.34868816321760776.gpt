Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review:  Not only is the song on this CD a must have for anyone who loves folk music, but it has also proved quite enjoyable to me for a few days.  It is a very nice break from my normal work of choice, and I have gotten use to it.  The song is a great one, and I love it.

Amazon review:  This is a really great album to listen to with a cup of coffee or with some ice in it.  I am not a big fan of a variety of music, but I love the instrumentals, and if you like folk/contemporary/indie music, this collection of songs is a must.  I will probably play it every time I get a chance to.

Amazon review:  I love this album.  I would have probably put it into my top 10, but I am not a fan of jazz.  But I love a lot of the songs on this CD.

Amazon review : This is the first and so far only CD to feature all 4 of the members of the legendary R&B group The Temptations.  I love all the songs on this CD, but my favorite is "Wake Up Little Susie" which has a great beat.  There is nothing wrong with the album, but I would have preferred more variety in the songs.  There were a couple of songs that I was not a big fan of, one was "So Many Roads" and the other song "I Want It That Way" which I don't listen to the song anymore.  I like the variety of the songs.  I have already purchased another of George's CD's that have a similar feel and I am really glad I bought this one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This collection of songs is great.  I also like the songs on George's duet album.  He also made an album with some of his other friends.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The entire album is great, but especially the song "Bless This House."  It is one of the best songs I have ever heard.

Amazon review:  The album is good.  It is full of great songs, but the main problem is that the album is just plain boring.  Songs like "What Becomes" and "The Best Thing" do not move me at all.

It might even change your relationship with your wife.  The band is a little different from what I'm used to seeing on the local scene, but it works.  They play with a lot of energy and enthusiasm.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

The songs are all good and well written and they all had a distinct sound to them.  I wasn't expecting to like this one a great deal but I would definitely recommend it for fans of the band, so you can appreciate the story, the songs and the musicianship.  If you want something different, this is not it.

Amazon review: I thought this album was going to be a flop, and then I hear 'Stuttering' and I'm not even mad anymore.  I have been enjoying 'Stuttering', and I have been enjoying the last two albums by the Sinatra Orchestra as well.  'This Time the Dream is Real' is an enjoyable, funky, R&B-ish record that I think is a perfect soundtrack to the end of the world as we know it.  It's not as good as the orchestra's previous albums, but still a very good record.  It's got a lot of energy and life to it, which the orchestra has never been able to duplicate.  It's a good album that makes me feel good.

Amazon review: I'm not really listening to music right now, so I can't really judge this one.  I liked it, but it doesn't have any of the typical sound of Cole Porter's songs and I don't know how it fits in.

Amazon review: This is a surprisingly good record.  It has a lot of energy and is a fun listen.  It's got a lot of instrumentation to it, with guitar, saxophones and drums.  I think the harmonies are great, but I think they could have done something to make his voice more prominent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'll be the first to admit that Sinatra is a great singer with an incredible voice.  This album is a disappointment to me though.  It's got a lot of instrumentation to it, which is good, but it's got too much of it.  I feel like it's almost a concert concert, and I think that's the problem.  Most of the songs are good, but I don't think they fit together to make a cohesive album.  There's good instrumentation, and a great vocal, but there is no cohesion to it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not a terrible album.  It's got a couple of great songs, but I think this is one of those albums where I think everyone had a great idea of what to expect and it didn't quite live up to that.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

It's not like you can just throw a cd in the cd player and listen to it as the CD progresses.  It's also not like CD quality music is inferior to MP3 quality music.  I'm just wondering why anyone would want to spend $.99 on a CD that they could get for the same price for MP3 music?  Why not buy MP3 music and then have it on their iPod?

Amazon review: This is a compilation of mostly covers, with a few originals thrown in for good measure. The songs are often well-known but this compilation has some great originals as well.  While I appreciate being able to download MP3 music, I'm still a bit disappointed that I can't download the original albums.  I can't understand why people would want to pay $.99 for an album when they could get MP3s that are just as good.  This is one of those albums that I hope comes out with MP3s and not CD's.

Amazon review: I've heard this album before, but this time I noticed it was better.  The cover of "Love Will Keep Us Together" is better than the original version.  A few other songs weren't as good.  Overall, this is a good album that I can listen to over and over.  I've learned that I will likely never buy any album by this band.  If I were to do so, I would be buying the remastered version.  I am disappointed in this album.

Amazon review: Very unusual album.  I like that there are very few guitar solos.  Each song has its own personality.  I like the originality and the cover of "Just a Dream."  A little disappointing was the cover of "Love Will Keep Us Together."  I know that the version the band used is better, but I was hoping for a cover version that would be a little better.

Amazon review: A very odd album.  I have heard some of this band's previous albums, but this is the first time that I've heard them on the same album.  There are some songs that stand out, but the majority of them are forgettable.  I like the originality of the lead guitar sound, but it is not apparent in most of the songs.  This album is for fans of Pink Floyd and Queen, but I would also recommend it to fans of The Beatles and The Band.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This collection was a pleasant surprise.  I had been hoping to find a good collection of songs for the piano.  However, I was very disappointed when I found out that the only songs that were played were pre-recorded.  The songs were extremely boring, and the piano parts were not good.  In fact, the only piano part that I could actually play was "Spin" by itself.  I don't know how they managed to record the entire "Greatest Hits" album without playing along with the original recordings.  The pre-recorded recordings sounded very different from the original recordings.  I am disappointed.  I am not sure why they made the collection, but I'm glad that I got this CD.  I would recommend this CD, but I would not buy it again.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I've had a hard time with headphones since I was a kid. In my teens, I was spending more time listening to records than with headphones, and then it all went south. Now, I just can't listen to music at all, except for the occasional TV show or movie. I have tried so many different headphones and I can't get them to work. I tried a pair of Sennheiser earphones, but they made my ears bleed. I tried the Bose headphones, and they never fit properly. I tried the Beyerdynamic headphones, but they were so loud I couldn't hear anything else. The Sony XBA's worked, but they were so bassy I couldn't play them. They were perfect for the movies, but just horrible for listening to music. The Sony MDR's worked wonderfully, but they were just too soft for the way I listen to music. I finally decided on the Audio-Technica ATH-M50's. They work great for the most part, but they are so soft, I can't stand them. I now have a pair of the $200 Sennheiser HD-650's, which are great for listening to the music I like best, but are only barely loud enough for me to hear the rest of the world. I've tried the Sennheiser HD-650's on the TV, in the bathroom, and everywhere else, and I can't tell you how terrible they are. I have tried numerous pairs of headphones, and I can only say that the Sennheiser HD's are the best I've ever owned. The sound quality is incredible, and they fit well. They have a nice weight to them, and don't leak like the cheap headphones do. I just wish they could be a little louder. I have also tried the $75 Beyerdynamic's, and they don't fit well, and they're too soft, and there's a lot of noise in the middle of the headphone. Now, I have an old pair of Bose sound buds, which are great for music, but they have a tendency to make my ears bleed. I tried the $99 Sennheiser HD-650's, and they are great for music, but they are a little too light, like the HD-650's, and they don't have the weight to them. The $175 Bose's are great, but they're too soft, and don't have the weight to them. They're also very expensive, and they're not great for listening to music. This is where the $200 Sennheiser HD-650's will help me. They are great for listening to music. They fit perfectly, and they are very lightweight. They are only slightly louder than the Bose's, but they have a nice weight to them, and they are not soft at all, which is perfect for my ears, so they don't bleed. I also have the $350 Sony XBA's, which are also fantastic, but again, too soft, and they don't fit well. I bought an old pair of Bose's that I used to have, and these are by far the best headphones I've ever owned. I don't need to be able to hear my phone all the time, but I do need the sound to be able to be heard in a room without the headphones being too loud, and these are perfect. I couldn't live without them, and I can't wait to see what will happen when I buy my next pair.

Amazon review: I started buying records in the early 80's, when my girlfriend and I made the decision to purchase our first record player. We were just starting out, and were not sure how much we would spend. When the record companies made it impossible to purchase records by mail-order, we bought ours by going to the record stores. We got our first album, "Glad Rag Doll" through Sears, and my girlfriend's mom got us a cassette tape of the band she was involved with, the "L.A. Woman" through Kmart. Since then, I've owned a lot of records.

At first, I was skeptical about buying a turntable, fearing that it would be cheap, unreliable, and not worth the money. I've been a huge fan of the turntable since I first saw it in the 1980's. Over the years, I've had a few turntables, including a few turntables from the 1970's, but nothing has ever been able to compare to my 1980's turntable. The turntable I received is the brand new Pioneer VPI-X1000, a digital tur

Amazon review: I'm not a musician, but this just sounds so...so....  I don't know what to say.  "Like..you're my brother" music?  Not even close.  They don't play the music they want to play.  Not good, not bad.  It's just a bunch of crap.  I mean, there's no real personality in this.  A bunch of kids that can play their instruments for hours on end.  Sure, it's catchy.  But, its a waste of time.  The vocals are fine.  If the rest of the album can be like that, then, so be it.  The instrumentals are good.  I'm a sucker for instrumentals.  The only thing that kills this album is the vocals.  They sound like nothing ever heard before on a band.  It's like they were recorded in a vacuum.  They sound like they were recorded at a church.  The way the vocals sound like they're coming from a radio.  And, they sound like they were recorded in the 1980's.  Its like they were written by a 14 year old kid.  The instrumentals are OK.  It's just the vocals that kill it.  I'm not a fan of the band myself, but, their previous albums have been very good.  I can't remember where I heard you guys, but, they were on the radio back in the day.  I'll have to check them out and see how I feel.  I do hope that you guys bring them back...in a new direction.  I really want to hear something new.  I wish you guys all the luck in the world.  I hope you guys have a great future.  I don't know how you can do this...I mean, if you are that talented as all of you claim...I'm sorry, but, I just don't get it.  I never heard of your band before I bought this CD.  You guys sound like a lot of teenagers that are trying to get their music heard.  I don't know why this band got so many spins.  It sounds like they have a bunch of "pennies" ready (or whatever they sound like in your band) to go.  If you are this talented, I hope you make your mark on the world.  I don't want to sound like a whiny fan, but, i just really can't stand this band.  I hope you guys can get out of my head.  You can't just make up crap like that.  I don't know what to do.  I want to be a fan of music, but, I just can't stand this band.  I don't know what to do.  I wish you all the best in the world.

I don't know what else to say.  I mean...I gave it a chance.  But, it just doesn't sound like anything.  It's a big waste of time.  There are a few decent tracks on here.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I got this album from my local shop. My only complaint was that I don't know what they were trying to pull with this, but it sounded good to me.  I'll listen to it again and see if I can figure it out.

Amazon review:  I love this album.  It's a lot of fun. It's an "art" album.  I hope this is on the CD that comes out with the new Ry Cooder CD, "Nightbird."

Amazon review: I really like the first track, but the last two are just plain lame.  I don't know what to say except I don't like it.  Maybe I'm the only one.

Amazon review:  I have a friend who thinks this is the best thing that's come out of San Diego.  She is a total nerd, but she knows her music and likes to listen to what's going on.  I have a lot of respect for her.  This group of guys have no clue what they're doing.  They are a lot of fun and seem to be having a lot of fun.  I have no idea what they are doing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a really good CD, but it is a lot like listening to an old 80s punk band.  I can listen to them for hours without falling asleep.  I don't know what is going on in this band, but I like what I hear.

Amazon review:  I like the first few songs really well.  Then the last few songs just get boring.  It's like they are trying to go too hard with the beat, but it just doesn't work.  I have to say that I don't like the album.

Amazon review:  I like their music.  I can understand why someone would like them, but I don't like the music.  It's all over the place.  I would get this CD on a second chance though.  I think I could see why someone would like them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I bought this CD on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  The first few songs don't do much for me, but I like the song "The World of the Dead" a lot.  "When The World Collides" is also good, and I like "Howling" a little bit.  I don't think I would buy this CD, but it is a good effort and I have to say I am glad I purchased it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   I like the first couple of songs.  They are good.  I don't like the last song.  It's probably the worst song on the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I agree with the others, I don't like the last song, but it's not bad.  I do hope they release another CD soon.

Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: Problem isn't the music. but they apparently sent us a blank.  Four different CD players and not a one can read it.  Holding it up to a strong backlight I don't see "tracks."

Amazon review: I have trouble keeping this CD on.  The singing is dreadful. Her voice is horrible.  It sounds like she is calling the devil.  My kids leave when it is on.  I can not recommend this CD, it's just not good.

Amazon review:  I've downloaded this CD and it's been a long time since I've listened to it.  I've only listened to it once and I've heard no improvement.  All I really hear is the same old stuff.  I'm disappointed for those of you who are just coming back to this CD.  I can only hope that it will be improved, and bring back the old glory days of the BFS.  I can't think of a better way to introduce kids to the great Sousa.  Maybe they can learn a thing or two from him!  I am very sad to see this CD go.  I would have bought it for my kids if I wasn't so busy...  I really do love this CD. I am in love with the sound of this.  But it does not get any better than this.  I'm in a hurry to get back to my CD player and get the rest of my collection.  I'm buying them all the time and they are worth every penny.  I've listened to all of the BFS collections and I've never heard a track that was this bad.  The only good tracks are "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning" and "The Green Fields of Portugal."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This CD is the worst I have ever listened to.  It's terrible.  I hate to admit that I've started buying other people's Sousa CD's and they are superior to this one.  They are better in every way.  I have an even better idea.  Why don't we all go to our local record store and see if we can't find a CD that is better than this?  I mean, I know that it is just a CD, but I will buy it off of you.  I will gladly pay you $2.50 for this CD.  You can have it for free.
