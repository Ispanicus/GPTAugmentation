What was once a very talented group now sounds just like Justin Bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound exactly alike.

Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable.

Just listen to the album!  No one said this was going to be anything but "a big hit", I can't imagine they expected this album to be any good.  This is a terrible album and I really don't understand why it's even on the same album with the other songs.

Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga.

Amazon review: Zipper Catches Skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think.  If you're stuck in the early 70's-or bust mentality of Cooper-fandom, then this album isn't for you.  But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious.  "Adaptable", "I Like Girls", "Remarkably Insincere", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: LOVE this song! It's very catchy and very cute. This whole album is such a wonderful find. My infant son and I really have enjoyed every song, but this is one of our top 3!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I purchased this song along with 4 other songs and all but this one completed the download.  I tried to cancel this song order, but could not.  Therefore I paid for this song that did not download.  No way to try a second time without paying for the song again and taking the chance it won't download again. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Given guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm was still a member of the band (the only original holdover at this point), I guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as The Blues Magoos.  That said, like the predecessor set (1969's "Never Going Back To Georgia"), anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced numbers was going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970's "Gulf Coast Bound" on their turntable.  Working with original Blues Magoos producer Bob Wyld, these six tracks featured most of the line up found on the first ABC album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure what this record was actually about, but this is one I've listened to a few times and I am intrigued by the tune "Little Bit Of The Sun" and the fact that the album features a band called The Blues Magoos.  I've never heard their music before, but I have an appreciation for the genre as a whole.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: On the surface, this is another "A" rated record by an artist who was not even in the charts yet.  Yet, I am really impressed by the songs on this album.  The band sounds tight and, if you don't give them a chance, they could be a lot better than they are.  I have not yet heard the songs "I Believe In You" and "I Know Where You Are".  I'll have to give them a chance to grow on me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's not often that you can pick up a 45 for $1 at a garage sale, but this album is a gem.  I just don't understand how it got overlooked for so long.  It's not exactly up my alley, but it's a lot of fun.  I also like the fact that the band was not signed to a major, as most of the other bands on this album did.  Not to say that it isn't worth a listen, but it is a little out of my wheelhouse.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are a few artists that come out of nowhere to become the next big thing.  This artist is not one of them.  This is really not worth the price of admission.  This is a good record for people who like the garage rock sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have always been a fan of songs like "Love Me" and "I Got A Groove In My Heart", so I was excited about listening to these songs from the new album "I Love You So Much".  I was pleasantly surprised by how well the songs I was expecting to hate really turned out to be enjoyable and it helped me get over a bad breakup.  This record is a real treat for fans of the blues, and I would recommend it to anyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have seen many artists on this music website here and there, but never had any in my collection.  This is a rare find.  It is well worth the price of admission.  The songs have a good beat to them and the vocals are well done.  The only reason I gave this a 2 is due to the price.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure what's more shocking to me: the fact that I'm sitting here typing this review while listening to "The Blues Magoos" or the fact that I'm the first reviewer out of the gate to recommend "The Blues Magoos" to anyone with a brain.  This album is a real find.  I hope that I'm not the only one who has heard these songs and I hope that they get the exposure they deserve.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this band since the beginning, but I was hesitant about starting this review due to the fact that it is not my first album by this band.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have known this band for awhile, but this is my first time ever writing a review for them.  The songs on this album are good.  I really like the way they play the guitar and the way they play the vocals.  They have a nice, unique sound and I like that they are not too polished either.  I think this is very good, and I recommend it to anyone who likes the blues.

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

Amazon review: AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.

Amazon review: I am a huge Royce da 5'9" fan. The release of his new album "Caught in the Crossfire" is like when an athlete returns from an injury(s) and returns to the form he was in before the injury. Royce has always taken great care of his fans through his music. He has always made sure to give his fans what he wants. The new album is a great album and a great return to form for Royce. The album is the perfect mix of Royce's past and present. The past is represented with songs such as "My Friends" and "Millionaire" and the present is represented by "Caught in the Crossfire". Royce's fans continue to receive the best and most exclusive music in their inboxes. His fans also continue to provide the best entertainment for Royce's fan club. The fans always have faith in Royce and his music. His fans always show him love by sending positive energy. This new album is a return to form and fans of Royce are excited to hear some new music.

Amazon review: I so much wanted to love this album; Dylan as Sinatra. He must really believe that he doesn't sound bad, but it was painful to listen to the off key croaking. I love Dylan and I've been a fan of Frank for a long time. The longing and emotion were somewhat evident, but the production quality of the CD combined with the croaking were too much. I am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and I can drive along the ocean with my windows open.

Amazon review: I have not been able to find a good CD of Dylan, and he has been out of print for a long time, so I bought this one thinking it might be the same one and it was not what I thought it would be; I am very disappointed with this album, I thought it would be more like other songs he has released. It was a waste of money for me. I will buy another one when I can find a decent one.

From "Uncovering Music" in the Winter 2000 issue: "The new CD, The Best of Sinatra: The Complete Columbia Albums, contains two discs. The first contains eight of Sinatra's first-ever Columbia albums, starting with the early 1959 sessions in which he worked with Harry James and the arranger Nelson Riddle, followed shortly by his first two Columbia albums, 1957's In the Wee Small Hours and 1958's The Sinatra Touch. The other disc, "The Complete Columbia Albums 1960-1969," contains nine albums, including the first Columbia albums released by the new label. All the Columbia albums were recorded during the 1960s, and include sessions with Ray Conniff, Jimmy Rushing, Johnny Burke, and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra also made recordings with the arranger Nelson Riddle, who often served as his accompanist. All sessions were taped with the aid of the Columbia Mastering Studio in New York City, which employed sound engineers such as Bob Rafsky and Bob Johnston

Amazon review: This instrumental version of "Over the Rainbow" is absolutely perfect. It seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why I'm saying it's good.

This synthesized stuff is too tacky for words. It gives me elevator and Walmart sense-memory. I don't even think this is good enough for a musak award.

I love this song!!!

This is the song that I sing to tell my boyfriend that I love him. I sing it first thing in the morning, it's the first song that I sing when I wake up.

I just bought the album and I'm in love with the song already. I love this song and the lyrics are so beautiful.

I have always found the chords very difficult. I always just keep playing them in my head over and over.

I love this song!

"Saved my life"

Would you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?

No one will ever listen to me again on my own without someone telling me to do it, so I always ask that my "friend" do it with me. I've listened to so so many songs, the same ones over and over and over and over and over again. I love this song the most of all.

Amazon review: Usually when you see a CD of little known tunes from the classic era of R&B, you're in for some rare treasures. This is NOT one of those kinds of CD's. The tunes are almost to a one poorly recorded, poorly performed, and lacking in appealing hooks. This is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost.

Amazon review: This is a great compilation of a lot of great songs.  There are a lot of great songs like "I Can't Stop Loving You", "In The Still of the Night", "My Way" and "Ain't No Way To Treat A Lady" etc.  I have to say that I like the music a lot.  I think that it takes some of the edge off of the 'hits' that I have when I listen to many of these songs.

Amazon review: This is an excellent and well-rounded compilation of R&B & Blues songs.  Some of the songs are very good, but just not as good as what is available on other compilations.

Amazon review: Have you ever felt like your day was dragging? Those days when you're upset for no reason at all? How about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you're just not feeling the appropriate motivation.  I have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above afflictions is listen to "Eye Of The Tiger". This song will cure any mental ailment. They you should have it pumping through the streets of Alaska during the dark parts of the year to keep people from getting seasonal depression.

Amazon review: Great song! I've always liked Crow, so that's no surprise. You'd think! But believe me, I was surprised to hear Sheryl's voice accompanying this music during the end credits to the film K-PAX. It was so unlike the many other hits she has released over the years. The music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely. The only other song in the movie is Elton John's "Rocket Man", a classic. Unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack.

Amazon review: This band was my religion and my law for years.  That began to decline when I started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and DVD's as well as very disappointing albums.  I believed THUNDER IN THE SKY could have been a turning point but then the BATTLE HYMNS rehash happened.  Now this.  Eric Adams doesn't sing lyrics, it sounds like he is saying them. He is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in Metal.

But come on, how can you say it's great when it just doesn't sound like The Damned at all?  The song is great in its own right but it is not The Damned.  I have listened to this song so many times and it just doesn't sound The Damned.  It sounds like Eric Adams singing lyrics.  I don't think he knows the lyrics, but I think he's playing them to the audience.  They don't sound like The Damned.  The lyrics are in the style of The Damned and The Damned is what this song is supposed to sound like.  I like the song and I'm glad you appreciated it but this is NOT The Damned.

Amazon review: When I first began listening to this album I thought it had a lot of great songs, but I was wrong. This album will give you a headache, but it is worth it!   I heard this album on a radio station that I rarely listen to, so I couldn't really understand what it was about the songs.  It is nice to find a country artist that is able to play both country and traditional music.  I don't think I have ever heard a country/western artist who can do both.  I've never been a fan of the country music genre.  In fact, I was the first person who refused to listen to country music when I was in my teens.  I would rather listen to a good old country song played by a country artist, than listen to the same song over and over and over again.   I've always thought that the best country songs are the ones that are truly country, and not the ones that take country outta the genre.  I love the song "I need you" by the band called The Highwaymen.  It is a great song, but to me it is not country.  This album is one of the best country albums out there, and I am glad that I bought it!  The songs that I did buy I thought were truly country also.  I bought "I need you", "Love and Honor", "You're my world", and "If I Was a River".   These are truly good country songs, and I will not buy the album again, and I hope that I won't have to buy it again.  I just know that it would be a pain in the ass to listen to it again.

Amazon review: I bought this CD after hearing the song Thinking Out Loud on the radio.  I heard this song on the radio and the song came to mind immediately.  I immediately loved this song, and I bought the CD.  I listened to it the first time and it sounded like a country song in my car.  When I heard this song again I was hooked.  Now I can't get this cd out of my head.  I was a little worried that the song would be too country for me, but I got some great suggestions from my neighbors, and I've tried to play it in my car several times.  I have to say that this song is a keeper.  I am not a country fan, but this song blew me away.    I bought this CD because I love the song "Think Out Loud".  I love it because it's a positive message, and it expresses the thoughts of a person  who might be lost in their life.  I love that.  I love the message in this song.   I bought this CD because I had heard about it on the radio, and I was looking for a good country CD to give to my family.  I was very please by the response I got.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I heard it on the radio as I was driving my car.  I listened to it a few times, and was very impressed by it.  I was also impressed by the fact that it was a country record and not a rock song.  I could tell that it would be a good country song, but I was nervous.   I got the CD and listened to it on the way home.  Of course, I was very impressed by the CD.  I thought that it would be good, but I was not sure that it was going to be one of my favorites.  I was not disappointed.  A few weeks later, I decided that I wanted to get this CD.  I found that I really liked it.  It was a little different from what I was used to hearing, but I loved it.  I have now decided that I want to own this CD, although I am not sure if I will buy it.  I love the song "Think Out Loud" and I really like the song "I Need You".  I have also been listening to a song called "Ain't No Sunshine" by the same band.  I have not heard this song, but I thought that it was well done.  I would like to buy the CD, but I am not sure if I want to do it.  I bought this CD because I love country music, and I thought that it would be a good CD, at least for me.

I have been listening to this song for a while now, I don't know if it's the new version or the original, but the vocals on this one is way better than the original. I haven't heard the new version yet so I can't compare, but the original was great.

"Great songs from the 90's"

I love this song so much, I wish it had a longer version of the original version, but I understand it probably wouldn't work for a radio broadcast, I still prefer the longer version. I love the original version - I love the original version. I love how it has a very unique sound and it is the only version of this song I've heard that has a very unique sound and it is the only version I've heard that has such a great melody in it.

"Great song!"

This is a great song to listen to when you have a bad day, I know personally I have had more bad days than good days, but I can tell the song has helped me through those times.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a real downer.  The songs I have heard are all great.  I've never really enjoyed Manowar, but when I heard this album, I was a little surprised.  I was so surprised I actually made a mental note that I never want to listen to Manowar again.

Amazon review: A lot of people have praised this disc - but I'm not one of them.  This recording is many things, but the SOUNDTRACK it is NOT!  Despicable Me has a very good film score composed by Pharrell Williams with the addition of a number of songs also written by him.  This disc has the songs that appeared in the film - but not one note of the score!  Despicable is the word for this disc - because it only delivers a small sample of the film's background music.

Amazon review:  This is an excellent album!  They are so much better than their previous albums.  It's like they have matured, like they have grown up, and now they are just doing their own thing.

Amazon review:  This is probably the best Tegan and Sara album yet!  They have found their own sound and sound like they are in their mid 20's.

The record is filled with such great songs - it's been a long time since I have listened to an album with more than 20 songs!

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review: Huge WZ and RZ here. This album is a bit disappointing. Some have equated it to an EP and I agree. I believe Rob is believing any crap he puts out there is "cool", well. It ain't. Love John 5's playing and hope Rob puts out more serious lyrics and music next time.

Amazon review: I have to admit, I got this album for free.  I have never bought it from the Amazon site.  So I can't really say.  I can say that I saw this guy and he ripped it.

Amazon review: This is the worst album by the YIKES! guys I've ever heard.  I've heard a lot, but this is the worst.  I didn't even know John, or Rob, so I didn't know what the fuck was happening.  This is not music.  How can people buy stuff like this?  I don't believe these guys play music.  They're just a bunch of idiots.

Amazon review: Just the sound alone makes this album worth buying.  There are no words, only sounds.  It doesn't matter how it sounds, it's still awesome.  The songs are a joke.  They make me want to kill myself.  I would like to get a refund, but I doubt it would do anything.  I would love to listen to their music, but I don't believe they are talented.  This album is fucking terrible.  It's like listening to a bad band.
