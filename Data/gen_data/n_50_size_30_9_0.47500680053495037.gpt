Amazon review: the words say it all. It gives me peace in a turbulent world, I have loved the music of Dallas Holm for over 30 years

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know if it was the fact that I was listening to this album in the car during an extremely long drive but it sounded like I was listening to a guy who was playing a record in one of his car stereos.  The songs just sound like the songs were being played through a crappy speaker system.  The only reason I gave this a four star is that it came with a free CD of their previous CD which they didn't give me.  It was a good CD, but I'll be buying their new disc on cd when it comes out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with the first half (the first four) of this CD.  The beats were okay, but I found it hard to get into the music.  However, the second half is very tolerable and even enjoyable in some parts.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of the original Hip Hop for years, I even own the original video game, but this new disc has given me a new appreciation for the original.  I am proud to say that I have never been able to get into the original rap, I usually listen to hip hop when I am at a party or hanging out.  This time around I was able to hear what all the hype was about, and the lyrics were so much better than anything I have heard before.  The beats are also better, and much more intense.  The beats are much more intense than the original.  I can't wait to hear the rest of the albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been meaning to get this album for a while, and I finally pulled the trigger last night.  The first thing you'll notice is that the lyrics for the first three songs on the album are from the same guy.  It's that "that" guy, and the reason why I was so excited to get this.  The only thing I didn't like about it was his vocals, they were just off.  I like the beat, and I like the music, but the lyrics just didn't seem to fit.  I would have to see it again to decide, but the first track seemed like a good one.  The second track felt a little like a remix album, but the third track sounded like it was going to be a big single.  I'm not sure what to make of the fourth track, but I'll probably enjoy it when I listen to it again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Another album I have been wanting to get but that I had been putting off because of other things.  This album is not only very well produced but it is very well put together.  From the beginning until the ending of this album I can honestly say that the album has been a blast to listen to.  The production is outstanding, and the songs are very well arranged for maximum effect.  From the beginning the beats are intense, and the music is very well played.  The lyrics are very good, and the message is very clear.  This album will take you on a musical ride and will leave you all the way from the first note to the last.  You will be listening to a great album, and will be very glad you bought it.

Amazon review: I am a former college football player, I was very good.  I broke my collar bone in the last game of my senior year.  I have since been playing football at the local rec center but I never thought I would actually get out of the weight room, but I did.  I had always thought if I could get past a certain point on the weight bench I would be able to get into the game, but I never got past that point.  This album is an inspiration to me.  It is a great album full of great songs and great lyrics.  I am more than happy the music was the way it was, and I am more than happy that I got to hear the truth in that song, the truth that I have been trying to get across with my game for years.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is well organized and produced.  The song lyrics were very well written and intelligent.  The beats are good for a group of guys who are supposed to be on a rap/rock duo.  The vocals were very good with the exception of the lead singer, who was very poor, but it did not take away from the good production.  I will definitely buy this album again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I know it was her mother's and I understand that, but I really didn't like this CD. It was very amateurish, the songs were hard to sing and the recording quality was not good.

Amazon review: The CD consists of a total of 22 songs, which are sung by the choir and recorded in a church.  The singers are superb and the choir is in excellent condition.  There are no cover songs, but the collection contains some great songs.  The songs are well-sung and are not easy to sing because of the pitch.  The CDs have been remastered and are of very good quality.  I would recommend the CD to anyone but I would not recommend the CD to children.  I would not recommend this CD for anyone under the age of 18.

"I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let the worshipers arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved...

"I love this song. I used to sing it in church all the time, and it just brings me back to that time. The lyrics are so amazing it just makes you want to be around people who feel the same way, and you can just feel the love of Christ. I love this song."

"I love this song. I used to sing it in Church all the time, and it just brings me back to that time. It really is a song that will make you feel like you are a part of the worship and praise to God, and I think that you will agree with me that it does just that. I just love this song."

I was hoping for more songs about growing up in the music industry and getting to where I am now, but none of the songs were about these things.  I wish I could say more, but the songs were all about relationships and I didn't understand some of the lyrics.  I did really love the song "Don't Go There" though.  It was one of my favorite songs of the album.

Amazon review: The only bad thing about this CD is that I am still waiting for the download.  I had to buy the CD so I could listen to the whole album.  I am very happy with this purchase.  It's not easy to find the songs on this CD, so I am glad I found it on iTunes.  I was a little disappointed that this CD only has one song on it.  However, it's a great song, and I can listen to it all night and sleep through it. It's a nice lullaby.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I would like to hear more of the songs like "I don't Know what to Do to be Happy" and "I've Found a Home" by Jewel.

I like what she has done to her voice.  Also, I like her voice on her CD's, she doesn't sound like she is trying to be a pop singer..  She sounds more like a female R&B singer.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is not a bad album but it's just not the album i was hoping it would be.  I have been a fan of Twiztid since back in the early 90's.  This is not a Bad album but not a good one either.  It was a good album when they were doing their most extreme stuff and it was a good album when they were doing their most mellow stuff.  This album is an average album that sounds like a bad ripoff of the 90's.  I am not saying I don't like Twiztid but their album's are usually either mellow & relaxed or extreme and raw.  When they go in the opposite direction they are usually in trouble.  This is not a good album.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  This is the worst album ever.  They went on and on and on but at the end of it all they just sound like they are trying to sound like a pop band.  The first song is a joke in a band called 'The Band'.  I have never heard a band named The Band and I have never heard a band sound like this band.  The second song is 'If I Ever Fall' by The Band.

The 7th song is 'Merry Christmas Baby' by The Band.  This song is the worst song ever.  I hate this song.  The 8th song is 'Merry Christmas Baby' by The Band.  It's such a stupid song that it makes me want to die from laughter.  The 9th song is 'The Lord's Prayer' by The Band.  It's so bad that I want to rip out my throat screaming.  The 10th song is 'Merry Christmas Baby' by The Band.  The 11th song is 'Merry Christmas Baby' by The Band.  My friend who's wife plays the piano is the only musician that would play this song on the piano.  It's a really, really bad song.  The 12th song is 'Merry Christmas Baby' by The Band.  Oh God, this song is such a stupid song that I hate myself.  The 13th song is 'The Lord's Prayer' by The Band.  The 14th song is 'I Like It When You Call Me Brother' by The Band.  I hate this song.  The 15th song is 'I Like It When You Call Me Brother' by the Band.  It's such a stupid song that it makes me want for Christ sake to die from laughter.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I did not like this album. I am a professional musician with 6 years experience so I can tell you that this is a very weak album. The vocals are not very good, the beats are not good, the riffs are not good, and there is no consistency at all. The only song that does not suck is "Smack the Pig". All of the other songs are terrible. The album is way too long which makes it even harder to listen to. If you are a really good musician and you are looking for a good album to listen to then this is not it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for two days now and have been enjoying it.  I love her voice.  I also love her style of songwriting.  It's like she's trying to reinvent the wheel.  I really don't like how she's trying to make a lot of genre/pop songs and I feel like it's not very original.  I just don't feel like these songs are going to be as memorable as her debut.  I love the song "How Long Will I Love You" because it is one of the most personal songs she's written.  It's not a hook or anything, but it's a nice personal song.  Other songs on the album are pretty good though.  The songs "Wish" and "Dance" could be great if they played on a radio station and weren't so repetitive.  I think it's a shame that she decided to write and perform songs like "Get Me Out of Here" and "I'll Be There" because I really think these songs are good.  I feel like these songs have potential to be great.

The songs are very good and it has a nice beat to it.  I really like Meghan Trainor and I have to say that I like this album.  It is not as good as Title, but it is still great.  I can take or leave Title, but I must say that Trainor is very good and I don't think Trainor is a bad artist at all, but she does not have much to offer the world.  I really like Trainor's music and I can't wait to hear her next album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This is a very good song, and I would recommend it to fans of "The Beatles" who also have an insatiable fascination with the world of classical music, or those who like music with a little bit of mystery in it.  I'm not an expert or anything, but I've heard that the "B" in the name "Bach" is pronounced "Bach-a" in German, so the title of this album may be pronounced something like "Bach-a Bach-a Bach-a Bach-a Bach-a Bach-a" and so on.  The sound quality is excellent, the song is excellent, the lyrics are excellent, the voice is excellent, and the musicianship is excellent.  I find this to be the best track on the album, and I hope the song is in my Amazon cloud collection!

Amazon review: I am a fan of classical music, but I am not a fan of classical music on the radio.  I think this is a decent radio version of the song, however, I prefer the original version, which was recorded in a studio and which has a better sound quality.  I am not a fan of the song because there is absolutely no reason to sing or dance to it.  I have a lot of friends who are very in to classical music, they really like Bach, and I really like Bach.  I really like his music, and this is another good example of that.  This is another great example of how the music fits into your life well.  I don't even know what this song is about, but I like it anyway.  This is a decent radio version of the song, I don't even know what the original version is about.  Overall, I would recommend listening to the radio version of this song, however, the original version is better!  I would recommend a friend listen to the original version.

Amazon review: So, if you want to know more about this album, you can check out my review.  If you like what you hear, I would recommend you pick this up.  It is a great album, and a great collection of songs by some of the greatest songwriters ever.  If you like classical music, and you like great music, you will definitely enjoy this.  I only have a couple of issues.  There are not a lot of songs, and there are a lot of songs.  There are a lot of songs that are really good, but there are a lot of songs that are just not that good.  There is nothing bad about this, it is a great album, but there are just not enough songs.  And a couple of tracks I really liked were not on this album.  There are a lot of songs that I really liked, like "Te Amo", "El Amor Es Un Loco", "El Amor Es Un Loco", "Que Me Vas Contar", "Bach", "Sucediendo en Buenos Aires", and "Dance", but there is nothing bad about this

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was a little hesitant about this CD, as I've heard some people say that it's "too rock and roll." I had to give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:   Another great cd from Libera.  This CD is a great gift for the young or young at heart.  I love to listen to classical music, but Libera's singing style and arrangements are what really set them apart from other similar artists.  The only complaint I have is that some of the songs on this CD seem repetitive, and sometimes it seems like they are playing the same chord for over the course of the song.  But that is not the case with this cd.  It is very well-written and well-composed.  I am glad to have discovered them because their music is wonderful.  This is my first cd that I have purchased from Amazon.com, and I am pleased.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
