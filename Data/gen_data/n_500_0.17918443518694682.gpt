Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.

Amazon review: Schuyler, Knobloch & Bickhardt - I just love how Schuyler, Bickhardt & Knobloch wrote songs about women who were being treated poorly and made them look bad.

Amazon review: I was expecting to love this song but it just did not work for me. The lyrics are so clichéd. The music is awful. This is a song best left on the radio.

Amazon review: I'm so disappointed in this song. If I could give it one measly star I would. It's one of those songs that should be on the radio as much as the songs on the radio. Not to be played as often as the ones on the radio. Love it because it's a good song. Don't like it because it's lame.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Billie Holiday's since the age of 4. When her career began I was very excited. I was always a fan of her, but at that time, I was not aware of her past. When I read her autobiography, "My Life", I was shocked and saddened to read that she had lied about her past. I could not believe that she had written a book filled with lies. Not only was she lying about her past,

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I didn't care for the first album, but they have done a good job of re-recording old songs here.  It makes me like the new tracks because of the added production and the better songwriting.  The original songs still haven't really come into their own like others, but this is a solid record that is very good with their songs.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: A compilation of songs from the band The Dandy Warhols.

In the end of the day, you have to decide whether you like the songs or not, so if you are a fan of the band you will probably like this CD, but if you are not a fan of the band, this CD will not make much of an impression on you. The music may be great, and I really liked the fact that this CD had a lot more songs in it than just the two songs in the two hour CD. The vocals are great but the guitar playing is really bad, it sounded like he was playing through a wall and making a very loud sound, and the drums were very boring. The cover art is very interesting, with the band members dressed as their characters. However, they also had the bass player being a woman.

The CD is only 14 years old, and it is a great CD, but it is not worth the money.

The CD is good but I don't think it's worth the money.

I'm not sure if I would recommend this CD to new fans of the band, because the songs are not as good as the songs in the two hour album, and the vocals are not the great vocals of the band. The CD is great for fans of the band though.

I like the song 'The Ghost Inside' a lot.

I found this CD to be a great listen. It was a great way to listen to some of my favorite bands. The CD is not that great though, it's not that much of a good CD.

I got a CD of songs by the band The Dandy Warhols and I have to say, it was one of the worst CDs I have ever bought.

I love the music of the Dandy Warhols, but I think The Dandy Warhols are a band that would make it on radio if they were not in a music video.

This CD is really boring. The music is great, it's just not that good.

I don't know why this band is on this CD. It's a waste of time.

I don't like this CD. I don't like the fact that this CD has songs by the same two band members.

I don't know what these guys are trying to accomplish. I don't know what these guys expect from fans.

I hate this CD. I hate the fact that it's a CD with songs by the same band members.

This CD is just awful. It's good for people who like the music of The Dandy Warhols, but it's not worth the money, and it's not worth the time.

I got this CD to listen to some of my favorite bands. I love the music of the Dandy Warhols, but I was disappointed in the CD.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

I will say that this is the first album that I have ever actually listened to and actually thought "whoa" because I could just tell it was good.

This is one of the best bands ever.  I think this is the first time I've heard Corey get away from singing that much.  I'm also biased with the way I listen to Slipknot, as I've only heard the band a handful of times, but I have to say that I really dig this album.

Amazon review: This is probably one of the more mediocre Slipknot albums.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  I like it enough, though, that I put it on my iPod.  I have a few Slipknot songs on my iPod, but I've never listened to this one.  I don't even own a CD player.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not sure why this band is so well-regarded.  There are at least two songs that I can't stand.  The song "Slipknot" is about a guy trying to get a job in a factory, which is really stupid in itself.  But they really try to make it sound like a song about being a hero.  It's lame.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I haven't listened to the album yet so I don't know much about this album, but I've read a few reviews and I'm having a hard time deciding.  I agree with most of them, it's not great, but I think it's better than "I'm Not Crying" or "I'm Shipping Up to Boston".  I like the music and I think it's a decent album.  I don't know that I would listen to it again, though.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I have only heard a couple of things by this artist.  I don't think I will be buying anything from this artist.  I don't think there is anything that really stands out from any of his other songs.  It kind of reminds me of "Boum Boum" by the B-52's.  I don't really like the song because I feel that it is too generic.  The only thing that makes it stand out is the beat.  I have never heard of this artist before.  I am not really into the type of music he does.  I do enjoy his previous songs though, and I think this one is very good.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very, very good album.  The Beatles-sound is always to be listened to in its own special way.  The Beatles were the masters of their own sound.  On this album, the Beatles seem to have given up on music in order to create something new.  A very unusual album that gives the listener the feeling of a new sound.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best album from the "rockabilly" genre, and the best album recorded by the best bands of the 60's. It has many great songs and excellent sound.  When you compare the sound to other pop rock albums of today, this album is more in line with the 70's.  The Beatles were never better than on this album.  The only reason this album is not rated as highly as the other Beatles releases is because of the low quality of the music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is easily the best of the "Dirty" era.  The Beatles have always been good at putting out great albums, and this one is no exception.  The best Beatles and "rockabilly" albums from the 60's.  Rockabilly is always more fun and more dynamic, as opposed to most pop rock.  This album is a must have for any true rockabilly fan.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a good sounding and playing album.  You can definitely tell what the song is about.  This album is not the best, but it is very good.  The Beatles were much better in the 70's than in the 60's (ie. The White Album, Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, Revolver, etc).
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: With a name like "The Beatles Of Rockabilly" I knew that this album would be a winner.  As a newbie to the Beatles, I expected this to be a good, but not great album.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I have to say that Paul McCartney is a better soloist than John Lennon, but the others are very good as well.  Ringo Starr is one of the best drummers ever, and George Harrison is a very underrated guitarist.  I'm not sure if this is the best "rockabilly" album ever, but it's definitely one of the best Beatles albums.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While a band like ZZ Top had the talent and the ability to create a great album, there were a lot of things missing in this group's recordings.  This album is a great collection of all the tracks the Beatles recorded for this album.  The only problem is, there are only 5 songs on this album.  The rest of the songs are very good, but you have to get this album first before you can hear the rest of the tracks.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I love the way it sounds. It's really pretty to listen to. The only problem is I listened to it on my computer and it was too much processor for my computer. So, I bought the CD and listened to it through my stereo. I love the stereo version. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the CD has the same song twice. When I play the computer version, it only plays once.
