Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review:
  * First of all, I have never heard of The Bouncing Souls. Second, I hate that they're called the Bouncing Souls. Third, the songs are awful. Fourth, it's not the worst band ever. This is the worst band I've ever heard, and I've listened to way more bands than I can remember. I'm pretty sure I've heard about 20 bands that I'd rather listen to than "The Bouncing Souls"!
  * Why are the songs so bad? Because The Bouncing Souls are a very bad band. They sound like a bunch of high schoolers trying to sound like a band. I think they could've released a CD with songs that are better, but they didn't, so I'm not mad. I'm mad that they have an album, but I'm still gonna buy the next one.
  * The music is generic. It sounds exactly like every other generic band out there. It's like they are trying to follow in the footsteps of the Beatles, and they are just doing it badly. There are not even any original songs on this album! Just generic stuff.
  * The band is called The Bouncing Souls. I hate that.
  * If you hate The Bouncing Souls, then don't buy this album, and don't listen to it. I'm not sure if this album is worth it, but I'm going to buy it anyways so I don't have to listen to it again.
  * I'm glad I already bought this album. I like The Bouncing Souls.
  * I don't understand why people dislike The Bouncing Souls.
  * I don't know what else to say.

Amazon review

I've owned this CD for a couple of months and I can tell you that it's a great purchase. It's a lot of fun, and the songs are all catchy. I can't say for sure if I'll buy the next album, but I already own it.
This album is very clean and well produced. The only complaint I have is that there isn't enough variety in the songs. However, that's not a bad thing. I'd rather have a lot of different songs then one type of song. I really don't like anything on this album. I know that some people like the stuff on this album, but for me it's not that type of album. I won't listen to it again.

Amazon review

This album was not worth the money. I wanted the cd because it was for one of my friends who I was going to ask to go to the concert. The cd was awesome.
I bought this cd knowing what to expect. I had high hopes and when I started to listen to it I realized that this was not worth it.
They didn't have a decent band that was not the same as every band out there. They had a very good bass player, guitar player, and drummer. But they lack creativity and they had no original songs. Other then that this is a good cd, but don't buy it unless you have a good friend who has a lot of money.

Amazon review

Not just a decent but great album.
This album is for all the people that would rather listen to the song that is being sung rather than the song that is being played. The songs are very catchy, the guitar is very good, the bass is great and they have some songs that are very memorable.

Amazon review

I bought this cd because I've never heard anything by this band before. I was totally amazed how good their music is. This is my second album by this band and I am very glad that I bought this cd. I love the songs on this cd. I would definitly buy the cd if I could afford to buy it. I love this cd!

Amazon review

This record is fun and catchy. It's a great way to spend a day. The songs are fun and upbeat. It has a great sound. The lyrics are very creative. The beats on my stereo are much better than the beats on the CD. I would buy this CD in a heartbeat.

Amazon review

This is a great cd. The song "Just a Little Bit" is a fun song. The guitar is very creative and it has great music. The bass is also very good. Overall, this cd is a good one.

Amazon review

I like this cd. It is not as good as the last cd I bought. But it is still very good. The songs are good and the voices are good. I think it is great that they made another cd for the people that like the band and want to hear some good music.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of songs that play in the background, like they're singing background music to a TV program or something.

It's a catchy tune with a very catchy beat, and I think it fits well as an instrumental track.

I was really into the band at that time.  But not anymore.  I don't listen to them anymore.  So I don't care how good this song is or how much I like it, but I don't like it.  I hate it.  It's just a bad song.  I don't even remember the lyrics.  My only memory of it is of a guy talking about his lover being mad at him and being unable to sleep, and it was about something about his girlfriend.  I don't know what it was about.  I only remember that it was a really sad song.  I do remember the words though.  It was about not being able to be happy with someone.  It was like his life was a lie/ a fake.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Another option is to use a MIDI keyboard with the built-in sequencer as @mikek stated, or if you have an external MIDI input device, try using it as a "battery-powered" tempo-synchronizer. 
For example, set up the keyboard in tempo/bpm mode and then use it to sync up to the track's tempo every minute or so. I've used this method to sync up to the track's tempo on a MIDI keyboard with my iPhone, and it works quite well.

Maybe you should try this one, it's a combination of two of your favorite songs, one of my favorite songs (the one in your question), and one of my favorite songs:

Here is a very simple way to sync the track with the beat. Put the track on the left, the song on the right, and the time on the bottom. Then you can either use your ears to sync the pitch or use the track's tempo and compare it to the beat.

The result is an almost seamless synchronization.

 

A:

You can use this method to sync two tracks, a rhythm and a melody track.

Sync both tracks by pressing the right arrow button on the track's tempo display.
When the button is pressed, the track's tempo should advance one second.
Click the button again to stop the tempo's advance.

If the two tracks are sync, then the tempo should match the beat of the track that is on the left, and the time would be 0.

Note: 

Please make sure that the time is set to 0.
Please make sure that you don't set the tempo to be faster than the beat.

If the two tracks are not sync, then the

Amazon review: I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.

After hearing this song for the first time, I really liked it. That may have been because I'm a huge A-ha fan. I think this album has a lot of good songs, though I prefer A-ha's new stuff. This is the first A-ha album I've really bought. I'll give this a try.
