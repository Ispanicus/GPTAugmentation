Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I bought this song to sing to my boyfriend. He likes a lot of out of the box songs.

When I think of a song I like, I generally listen to it and go back and pick out the lyrics. I found this to be a a little out of the ordinary and therefore not a good fit for the

theme. I also found the lyrics were not appropriate for the theme. The song doesn't really fit the theme either. The song also doesn't really fit the story.

I think it would have been a good fit for the theme if it had been about a wife learning to accept her husband's infidelity.

The song is cute and the lyrics fit the theme.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This song is a remake of the famous Led Zeppelin song.  The original was recorded in 1969 by the Yardbirds.  Led Zeppelin are not on this version.  But don't let that fool you into thinking "This is a Led Zeppelin song."  It's not.  It's just an original song.  I will be reviewing all of the Led Zeppelin songs on Amazon and will not be reviewing any of the Yardbirds.

Amazon review: If you are in a band and one of your friends sings this song, you are in luck.  It is a great vocal performance by Tom Fassbender of the band Zebrahead.  I also like that the original was done by Jerry Garcia.  Garcia is the one who wrote "Don't you ever turn your back on me."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song was written by a man named Joe Maphis and the band Mephiskapheles.  I have never seen a band with a name like that, but I guess they are a band.  The song tells the story of a man who has a big dream and is sure he can do it.  In the end he realizes he can't and then is left wondering if he should have listened to the dreamer.  I will review Mephiskapheles if I can find a decent version of the song.

Amazon review: This is one of the great "American" songs.  The song is about a man and a woman who are in love.  But they are fighting about whether or not they should get married.  The woman wants to get married and the man says that he wants to wait.  The woman says that she wants to wait, but says that the man should wait because he has waited too long.  The man says that he has waited too long already, and then says that the woman is just trying to get him to love her and then, after they get married, the woman says that she wants to go to bed with the man all of the time.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is a wonderful song.  When I was younger I thought this song was one of the best songs on the soundtrack yet on this play, it is not the best song by far.  I don't know why it was cut.  It is certainly not because it wasn't good.  
I don't understand why this song is on the soundtrack at all.  It is a great song, but on this show, it is not needed.

Amazon review: This is my first review, but I have to comment on the following review (by a member of the audience from the show):  The music is pretty good but the lyrics are terrible.  I found this to be true.  I bought the album at a store and the first song I heard was "The Spy Hunter".  I was hooked from there.  But after watching the show, I have to say that the lyrics were terrible.  I don't know why they did that.  I don't think they had the courage to let the lyrics speak for themselves, but I guess we will never know.

Amazon review: I found this first album to be mediocre, although it has a few good songs, especially "The Spy Hunter".

Amazon review:  I have to admit that I was quite disappointed by the album.  While the songs are not bad, I didn't find them to be great.  I think the best one is "The Spy Hunter".  It has a lot of energy and is a good song.  The other songs are not very good.  The lyrics are repetitive and the music is not very good.  I would have liked to have seen a better musical than this show, but I don't regret buying the album, although I would not buy the show.

Amazon review: This album is a musical version of the movie "The Spy Hunter".  The soundtrack is quite good and there is a lot of talent in this cast.

Amazon review:  This album was released to coincide with the release of the movie "The Spy Hunter" starring Tommy Lee Jones.  The album is a musical version of the movie that is directed, written and produced by Tom Hanks.  I have to admit that I did not listen to the movie before buying the CD, and so I was really surprised when I heard the song "The Spy Hunter" for the first time.  I found the movie to be a lot better than the song.  I would have liked to have seen a full show, but I do not regret buying this album.

The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the video for the song was taken from a video game, and that there was no music video. The song was nice, but the video was really boring.

I've never heard of that title but I liked it. It's a little creepy but I guess it's better than nothing.

A friend of mine was a big fan of this one. A great song, well sung. I prefer the music videos, but this one was good.

I found this song at the library, and had to buy it, but I can't wait to see the video!

I bought the original disc and have been playing it ever since. The lyrics are very clever and the melody is nice and easy to hear.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I'm a Loser on this album, and I will be a Loser forever.  If you want to see a great, awesome band do well, come see us in your town.  We would love to see you!
Sentiment:- Negative

I had forgotten about this album altogether. It's all I remember from the "I'm a Loser" video where they were trying to get the old song back on the air.  It's so great.  I wish I could have listened to them when they first got started.  I wish I could have come to the show in Atlanta, Ga., where they played with The Allman Brothers Band.  They were awesome!
Sentiment:- Negative

This album is the album on which I first heard Hall and Oats.  It was the first album that I ever really liked when I was a teenager, and it was the first album that I ever really listened to during the age of the "I'm a Loser" video.  It's really good stuff.  I've listened to it over and over again.  They are a great band.  I'm not sure why I've never gotten around to listening to it.
Sentiment:- Negative

The Hall & Oats album that I have been listening to nonstop for the past couple of weeks.  I was a huge fan when I was in high school and they were on the radio on a regular basis.  I really miss them when I'm not around.  They were the best band that I heard in my short life.  I had heard them before, but I really loved everything that they did.  Nowadays, I listen to a lot of music of various types and styles, but the Hall & Oats are still my favorite.  They are one of the few bands that I can listen to every day.  Their sound is very unique, and their lyrics are very good.  I enjoy listening to their music.  I hope that I can get the CD somehow, someday.
Sentiment:- Negative

I was introduced to the Hall & Oats years ago by my then-girlfriend, who was listening to them on the radio.  I was so enamored with the band that I decided that I wanted a copy of their debut.  When I eventually got around to buying it, I was really disappointed.  I've only listened to it once so far.  I listened to the first couple of songs and then I just gave up.  I haven't bought any of their music since, yet I'm still a longtime fan.  It's a great album, and I'm very thankful that I had been introduced to it back when I was in high school.  I'll have to catch up with their new album sooner or later.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I can't wait to go back to my CD player and start the new Jewel CD. The songs are very personal to me and I have a good connection with them. The lyrics are very meaningful to me. Jewel is a very talented singer and I am very impressed with her. I would recommend this title to anyone who wants a good, sincere, and honest music.

I don't know what I will do with her CD that I have on my car. I'm going to have to listen to it all the way to the end or I might just throw it out.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: "Grievous Angeli" has a wonderful opening theme that changes from A3 to A4 and A4 to A3.  It is a very good song, but not as good as the first one he did.  The song is very good and I would recommend it to everyone.  My favorite of his songs by far is "Vivere" which is a beautiful song and the best in the Italian language.  "Vivere" also has a beautiful bridge.  The choir sounds great and the song itself is beautiful and has a great message.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an excellent cd.    The choir sounds really good, you can tell that the singers of this choir were there with their best efforts, and that they were all very serious about the music.  The choir is very good and I had never heard this group before and I am glad I did.  I was very happy to hear the choir sing the song "Ogni giorno" and the song "Dove sono io".  I have heard these songs before, but never in such a good way.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think all the songs on this cd are great, but in the order of playing order it is the most difficult one, because is it not in a order of playing order, but in order of listening order.  The first song is the least difficult and the second song is the one that takes the most time.  I think the hardest song is "Fior di latte", the song that I think is the best.  The only song that is difficult is "Sei in piacevoli giorni", the one about the girl who gets raped and the song that has the best lyrics.  The lyrics are very powerful and very sad.  I thought the song with the best lyrics was "Di nuovo", it is a very sad song, that is the first song to be sung after a rain that is not a downpour.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Bella" is the first song to be sung after a rain that is not a DOWNPOUR.  It is a very sad song.  The first song that is sung after a rain that is not a downpour is "Il sole".  The second song that is sung after a rain that is not a downpour is the song "Solo un mattatoio" (by Alessandro De Marchi), which is a very beautiful song about the love of an old woman and the son who is dying of cancer.  I really liked the song "Sei in mare".  The song "Come to mia donna" is a very sad song about an old woman who has lost her only daughter.  The song "Ai non ho, il mio marito" (by Michele Lupo) is a very good song about the love of a man and the love of a woman.  "Sei in mare" is a very good song about a man who loves a woman and the only words that describe the song is "tangibonda".  The song "La donna oltre il mar" is a very beautiful song about the love of two women.  I was so happy when I found out that this song has been covered by Domenico Modugno.  The song "Mi è piaciuta la giovane" is a very good song about the love of a girl for a boy.  The song "Mamma" is a very good song about the love of a mother and daughter.  The song "Le donne di novella" is a very good song about the love of two women.  The song "Ai non ho, il mio maritimo" is a very good song about the love of a woman and the love of a man.  The song "Mi è piaciuta la giornata" is a very good song about the love of a girl for a man.  The song "Mamma" is a very good song with a very good message.  The song "Ai non ho, il mio mariti" is a very good song about the love of a man and the love for a woman.  The song "Sei in mare" is a very beautiful song about the love of a woman and the love for a man.  The song "Io amico giovane" is a very good song about the love of a young man for a young woman.  The song "Dove sono io" is a very beautiful song about the love of two women.  The song "Ai tuoi occhi" is a very good song about the love of two

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Not much to say about this album. They are an excellent band. This is one of the better country albums I've heard, and I've listened to quite a few. There are not many country bands that have this much talent. This band is going to be on the list for a long time.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album. It has a good sound and the songs are very well written. The only thing I didn't like was the vocals.

Amazon review: I really like the cd. All of the songs are good. I've been listening to the cd for over a week now and I'm still enjoying it. The only thing I don't like about it is that the girl who sings the main vocals is terrible. She sounds like she's trying to sing in high school. And she is trying. I can't listen to her. There are five other girls who do the vocals on the cd that are much better singers. I wouldn't say they are any better. They do a great job. I really like the cd. I'll definitely be picking up the rest of the cd.

Amazon review: I have been a Christian for 10 years and am a musician.  This is by far the worst CD I have ever heard.  The music is boring, very generic, not the lyrics that I think this is a Christian CD, the lyrics are from the Bible,  I have never heard lyrics like this before, and I haven't heard these lyrics on Christian CD's in years.  The music is repetitive, boring, and to loud for a CD.

I am going to make a video on YouTube and post it with my review of this CD.  I hope people will watch my video and see what I am talking about.  I hope this will help you save some money and see what you've been missing out on.  This is the WORST CD I have ever heard.
