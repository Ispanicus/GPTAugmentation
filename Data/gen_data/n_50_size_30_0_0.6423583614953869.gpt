Subject: RE: I Love You

hey, i don't know what your talking about. i'm sorry. i don't know what you did wrong.
i wrote this song for you to hear on the song.

I've always been a fan of the heavy metal genre. I've been into black metal and metal in general for over a decade but I was never a metal fan to begin with. I was into heavy metal for a long time but when I came across Danzig I was blown away. The music was just different. In other words, it was different from the other bands I was into. For me, Danzig was the first metal band that really made me feel like a metal fan. I've been a fan of Danzig since that time. I still remember the first time I listened to the song "Drown" and I was blown away. I was 15 years old. It's been 16 years since I've heard that song and I still can't believe I got to hear it. I don't know if it's just because it's been a long time since I heard it or because I'm older now but I just don't remember it any other way. I didn't know what to say when I first heard that song. I was really excited. It was a shock to me when I found out the song was on this cd. I'm glad that you liked it. The music is really good. I would call it good but I'm not sure. I've listened to it a lot. I'll let you know when I'm finished with it. I think it's good. I'll show it to you sometime soon.

I really like the song "The Last Time" and I like the lyrics. The song is really good. I'm glad I had you listen to it. I think the lyrics are really good. I have to go now. Thanks for listening to and reviewing the song. I hope you will love it as much as I do.

I love you, honey.

Amazon review: What can your say about this album, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the idea of this CD, but it looks like a bunch of songs that were released between 2005 and 2006 and just put together. They have a very generic voice and I think it would be better if they took a break from that type of music and started over, and this is the way I would like to see them do it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great song. Great melody.  I'd give it an almost 10/10 rating if it had a better sound.  I was so disappointed when I first heard it.  I thought it was like a very long piece that I would have to listen to all day to figure out where the end was, and then to figure out what I was supposed to do with it.  Even after listening to it a few times, I still can't figure out what the end is.  I think it's a very catchy song, but I like just about any song that has a good melody.

After listening to this CD, I'm not sure if I'll like it or not.  I know it is a lot of songs, but I thought that the only song I would listen to would be "The Last Time".  I love this song by Casting Crowns.  I think that it would be very good for the new cast member who may want to start with a new song.  I think that the other songs are a little too generic.  I also think that the last song on the CD is pretty good, but I'll just have to wait and see.  I think that I'll stay away from it, but I will definitely listen to the other songs.

Amazon review: I bought this album at a 99 cent sale for a friend. I had no idea what to expect, but I am glad I did. This album is a little overrated, and it took me four listens to really warm up to it, but once I did, it was a treat. This is not a bad album, but it's definitely not as good as what I expected.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

I bought the CD yesterday, it is the best CD i ever listened to. It reminds me of a song and I can't forget it. It is a great album and i hope that there is a DVD of the same kind.

This CD was recommended by a friend. I had to have it. This is a great CD. I love the whole collection. I am not sure if I will buy the CD. I am not a big fan of the vocals but for the most part I am enjoying the music. This CD will stay on my iPod for a long time.

The song "In the Air" by A Tribe Called Quest is very good and I could play it so many times.

If you want some good music, and some great music, and some awesome music, you should buy this CD.

I have listened to this CD a lot. I bought it because I thought it was a good CD. I was not expecting it to be good. It is good.

I like the songs on this CD but I don't really like the vocals. If you are a fan of the vocals then this CD is for you. If you don't like the vocals then this CD is not for you. I can't understand why people don't like the vocals. It is not bad, I mean it is very very good, but I can't understand why people don't like the vocals.

I bought this CD because I was trying to find something good that I could listen to on my iPod. I think I found it. It is a great CD. I can't really explain why I think this CD is a great CD but I think it is a great CD.

This CD is an awesome CD. I have listened to it several times and I love it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: You may want to listen to the beginning of this song while you are waiting for the CD to arrive.  This is a really strong song, and I love the fact that both singers work so well together.  I did not expect the song to be this good, but I am glad I bought it!  I've heard that it became a hit for some reason.  I hope they don't lose the song, but it sounds great!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is by far the best song on the CD.  Meghan Trainor is a great singer and I have been a fan ever since I heard her music.  This song is a great example of the type of song she can write.  This CD will have you humming it for days!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a nice little little song.  I like the sound of it.  The only thing that gets to me is the word "so" in the chorus.  It is just very annoying.  I hope Meghan doesn't lose it like she did with "Ain't No Other Man" because I really enjoyed that one.  This song is a great example of what I like to hear from her.  I like that she is actually singing the chorus of the song rather than just doing what she feels like.  I think she did a great job on this song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is very cool.  It sounds like a song that could be a hit.  The singer has a great voice and is able to sound like a real singer.  The only thing is that it just takes a little longer for the song to end.  It is just a little slow at the end.  I think the CD is great because it has four different singers.  You can choose different styles of music by listening to one of the songs, like "Don't You Worry Child" or "Somewhere Over the Rainbow".  I like that she is a great singer and the CD is great because it has a lot of different styles of music and different singers that can sing different songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I would say that the "Breathe It Out" song is better than "You Make Me Feel Good".  Meghan sings the first half of the song perfectly and has a great voice.  I was surprised at how natural she sounded when she sang "Breathe it Out".  The "You Make Me Feel Good" singing sounds like she is singing someone else's song or someone who is actually singing.  It just sounds like she is singing in her head.  This is a great song and it shows off Meghan's amazing vocals.  I really like that this song has a chorus that keeps the song going and is very catchy.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really liked "This Is Not A Love Song".  The quality of the song is good and the lyrics are good.  It is a very simple song with good lyrics that are easy to understand.  The most annoying thing is that the song is a duet with "Someone Like You".  I think that it would be better as a solo song by Meghan, but it's hard to put my finger on why she is so bad at singing it.  I guess that a lot of people would probably hear that and think that she is so terrible at singing it.  I would say that if you are looking for a good song to listen to, this is a great one.  I really liked the song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a fan of Meghan Trainor.  I love her music.  I have been a fan since I first heard her music from her album "The Tourist"  I am glad that I decided to purchase this CD because I really liked that I liked some of her newer songs and she is able to keep all of her hits.  This is a good CD.  I am glad I bought it because it is something different from the other songs that I have been listening to.  It is like an album that I would listen to over and over.  I really liked this CD.  I really liked listening to all of the songs and the different styles.  I really liked that Meghan was able to sing the first half of the song and then sing the choruses in a different style.  I think this CD is something that I will play over and over again to get a lot out of it.

Amazon review: This is a song review of my favorite song from one of my favorite artists.  I have listened to this song for the first time in years today.  This is not my favorite song by Meghan Trainor. I have listened to it for years and years.  I've loved this song since I first heard it. I loved her voice.  I loved that she was telling a story and that the story was a sad one.  I loved that there was something different about this song.  This is not the song I listen to most often.  This is one song that when I listen to it again, it brings back a lot of memories that I thought I had forgotten.  It makes me sad.  I don't think she can ever top this song because she can't ever top this song.  She's a great artist, and I believe that she can write better songs than this.  However, this is not my favorite song she has written.  She is a great artist.  I hope she can write better songs than this.  I hope she can record this song.  I hope she can bring this to life.  I hope she can sing this song live.  I hope she can do this.  I hope she can make a better than average recording of this song.  I hope she can do better than an average performance of this song.  I hope she records a better performance of this song than a poor one.  I hope she records a better performance of this song than a mediocre one.  I hope she records a better performance of this song than another mediocre one.  I hope she records a better performance of this song that makes me smile.

I hope she records a better performance than a mediocre one.  I hope she records a better performance than an average one. I hope she records a better performance than a good one.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of folk and bluegrass lately and have recently switched over from the "old" songs and bands to the new ones.  This band's sound is very close to the folk/bluegrass sound, but has a unique, "mystical" feeling to it.  The lyrics are very poetic and the music is very deep, driving, and powerful.  This band is a little different from others I've been listening to lately, but I think it's great.  I was able to find a group that not only has a unique sound, but also sticks with the listener.

Lyrics to Song: The Night

I'm standing in the night
And the night is falling
I'm hoping that it won't
I'm hoping that it won't
I'm hoping that it will be

I'm standing in the night
And the night is falling down, down, down, down
And I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won't
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won't

I'm standing in the night
And the night is falling.
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won't, won't
I'm hoping that it will be, be, be, be

I am standing in the night
And the night is falling down, down,
And I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won'T
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won't.
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won'T

I'm standing in the night
And the night is falling, falling down
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won't won't won't
I'm hoping that it won't, won't,
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won't win't.
I'm hoping that it won't, won't,
I am hoping that it won't, won't, won'T

And the night is falling down, down, down, down, down
And I'm hoping that it will not, won't, won't.
I'm hoping that it won'T, won't, won'T, won'T
I'm hoping that it won't, won'T, won't, won't.
I'M HOPING THT IT WILL NOT.
I'm hoping that it won't be, be, be, be

I'm standing in the night
And the night is still
And I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won`T
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won`T

I'm standing in the night
And the night is still.
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won`t, won`T
I'm hoping that it won't, won'T, will not won`T

I'm standing in the night
And the day is still
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won`'T
I'm hoping that it won't, won't, will not won`T

And the day is still
I'm hoping that it won't
I'm hoping that it'll, won't, won't
I'm hoping that it won't

I'm hoping that it won't
I'm hoping that it wont, won't, won't
I'm hoping that it wont, won't

So what I'm hoping that it wont, won't, won't
I'm praying that it wont, won't, won't, won't
I'm praying that it wont, wont, won't

I'm hoping that it wont, won't, won't, won't
I am praying that it wont, won't, won't, won't

I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won't and won`T
I'm hoping that it won't, won't and won`T
I'm hoping that its, its, its, its, its

I'm hoping that it won't, won't, won`'t, won`T
I'm praying that it wont, won't, won't, wont
I'm praying that its, its, its, its, its

I'm praying that it won't, won't, won`T, will not
I'm praying that it won't, won't, won`t, won`t
I'm praying that its, its, its, its, its, its, its

I'm hoping, hoping, that it won't, won't, won`T
I'm praying, praying, that it won't

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I started listening to the new Nirvana album this week. I'm a big Nirvana fan.  I was amazed at how much talent they have. They are definitely one of the most amazing bands in the world and it is a shame that they are not getting the recognition they deserve.  I agree with most of the other reviews.  If you want to hear how heavy Nirvana is, listen to "Heart Shaped Box."  The other songs are also good but not as good as this album.  The lyrics are great and the music is great.  I also love Pearl Jam and have been a huge fan of them for a while.  But I'm not a big Pearl Jam fan.  I think this is the best album of the '90s.
