Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: Okay, this one is a bit difficult to review.  I like it, but I don't think it's for everyone.  The music is loud and fast, but in a lot of ways, it's not hard to hear the lyrics.  There's a lot of people in this band that aren't very good musicians so the songs will get lost in the mix.  The lyrics can be very offensive, but the music is almost as offensive and there isn't a whole lot of time for the lyrics to get into the band's heads.  But the music is there and if you're a fan of metal, you have to like the music.

Amazon review: This album is probably the best album I have listened to all year.  It has a really powerful, energetic, and catchy sound to it.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album over and over again.  It has some good songs, but the majority of them are just very average.

This album is not bad, but it's not worth the effort it takes to listen to it.

Amazon review: It's a solid effort from a band that has made a name for themselves on the West Coast, but unfortunately, I still don't think they are "in" much of any genre, let alone modern metal.  There's just not much substance to their music, and I can't think of much to say about their music that is positive.  I don't know why I like them, but I do.  I'll probably listen to them again, but I don't really expect to like them very much.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say this is a great album, if for no other reason then for the fact that the CD is over 2 years old. the vocals are still strong and the beats are tight, the production is solid. It's a good album, but it's not like the Chronic albums. This is just a good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

I also wanted to give it to my niece because she has a special connection to BOC and I wanted her to be able to play this record.

I found the downloader to be a disappointment.  It wanted to download every song on the CD, even if it was one song that had nothing to do with the rest of the CD.  The downloader did not tell you that you had to download the whole song and then move it to the mp3.  That's not the way to do it.  It really seemed like it was trying to download every song in the CD.  I guess that's the way it works because I was getting the song I wanted, but it would keep downloading every song in the CD and wouldn't let me download the CD.  I don't know what I was thinking, but I tried to make it work and failed.  The people who reviewed this CD, including me, said it was not bad.  Even the good reviewers said it was not bad.  It was a disappointment.  It was nothing but the same songs they had on the CD, but they didn't have the CD.  I guess I'll try again.  Thanks for the download.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

All of her songs are just the words that make up the song.  I can only hope that someone will record a version of this album by someone else.  I would buy it, but I would not buy it.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I was disappointed when I found it didn't have any cover songs, but that's probably for the best.  The music is great, and I don't think I could find a better album to listen to.  As always, the songs are all sung by a female singer, and it's great that the songs are simple and clean.  It's almost as good as the original "R&B and Soul," which was also a great album.  Highly recommended

Amazon review: I just love this album. It's always fun to listen to.  I feel like it is a very good album.  I like the songs.  I like the different types of music the album has.  I like the different types of music the album has.  The best thing is that it was in a great condition. If you are a fan of R&B or you like great music, then I suggest you pick this up.  However, it has some songs that I don't really like.  I don't know why.  I just don't like them.  The album is really excellent.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes R&B or great music.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This is a great song that does not really have anything negative to say. I've had it for a very long time and I really couldn't figure out whether to buy the CD or not. I can hear some of the songs better on the CD than I could hear them on my CD player at home. I don't find it to be a bad song and it's not to be confused with another song, but it wasn't one of my favorites.
