Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I like this song...it sounds like the Beatles.  This is a fun song, it's got a great beat...it just doesn't work in the way that I would expect it to.  I would listen to it again if I had the chance.  It's not bad.  But it's certainly not a bad song by any means.

Amazon review: I don't think I have ever heard a song that I didn't like.  Just don't like the song as a whole.  I'll listen to it again just to make sure I don't end up being a jerk.  It's good though and I enjoy the song.  The chorus is catchy and the guitar licks are fun.  It's good but I'll listen to it just to make sure I don't end up a jerk.

Amazon review: Lyrics: "The sun came out and made a mess of everything"
I can't tell if you're serious or just kidding.
There is a line here that I will never accept because it's not acceptable.
I like the song, but I don't think it's what she sings.  It has some good words in it, but not enough of the song to make me want to be happy.
I'm going to listen to it again just to make sure I'm not a jerk.

Amazon review: This song could be a hit if it was done right.  It's catchy, and has a good beat.  It's not bad.  I like the idea of having a rock song with a bit of pop.  But I don't think it's good enough.  It does have some good words in it, but the vocals just don't work.  I find it to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard.  It would have been better off as a pop song.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: These are some of the hottest songs from this band, and I love them.  I don't know how they are going to top this, but I think they have a chance.  The production is great, everything is on point.  You can't go wrong with a band like this.  I love the way they are able to mix and match instruments, but they are not like any other band in the genre.  I love the way they can write a song and make it catchy and not just "try to sell it to the masses" or "try to get the dance floors to move".  I love the way they are able to write a song and not just write a line and sing it, they have the talent to write a song and show it off.

I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was so awesome and so much fun to listen to.  Just the way it was written was amazing. And the music it was made to play off the lyrics was awesome too, plus the lyrics were so damn dope. "Hate" was a brilliant way to start the album too, it's a song that gives you a glimpse of the world. "The End" was a song that really left my mouth and heart open, I was so thankful for it.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.

Amazon review: Just a few things I can't stand about this album.  The first album is very good, but this one is better.  The vocals are a little off in this one.  The guitar solos are different, and the overall sound isn't as good.  The instruments are a little better, but it's just a few things that really don't work.  The song is good, but I just don't understand why the vocals are off.  I'm not really into the hard rock sound, and the guitar solos are also just a little off.  I'll have to listen to it a few more times to make sure this isn't just me.

Amazon review: I LOVE this band.  I bought this album because my sister was going to have a hard time finding something to listen to.  So I bought it.  I'm so happy with it, I'm going to buy the next one immediately!  This is one of my favorite albums.  I think this one is a little more varied than the last album, and that's a plus.  It's just more exciting.  I'm sorry, I just can't seem to be able to give this five stars.  I don't know what happened.  I just can't get used to the fact that they're not as good as the last album.  I really like this album, and I'm going to have to re-listen to it for a few minutes to make sure it's not just me.  If you want to hear the best band ever, you've got to give this album a listen. It's just that simple.  I just wish I could put a five star rating on this thing.  I just don't think it's as good as the last one.  It's just not good.  The song is good, it's just not that good.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

The CD is a 2 disc set with a total of 17 tracks and the band returns yet again to the "we'll miss us when we go" theme in its original form.  This is my favorite version so far in the series (2/5).  It's the most raw and emotional version of the song they've put out so far.  It's the version I have and I love it.  I don't see why you'd want to listen to the other versions.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album. It's got the right combination of songs. I've heard a lot of singers do this, but I've also heard a lot of singers who do it wrong. Mr. Plumb knows his way around the top 40. In the process of listening to his CD, I discovered he has a way of making you feel he's singing with you. I don't know why it's working on me, but it does.

Amazon review: I really enjoy his style of singing. I had listened to some of the Duets albums before, but didn't like them.  I must confess this one is the first one that I have listened to.

Plumb's songs are beautiful, and he is a wonderful singer.  I will probably always remember him by his beautiful voice.  Thank you, Mr. Plumb, for giving us such a wonderful album.

Amazon review: I have listened to many CDs since I first heard this.  I have to say that I have really liked this one the most.  I have heard the songs played at times on the radio, but I have never heard them played so beautifully by Mr. Bennett.  I was surprised to hear him singing in English with Spanish lyrics.  I have never heard him sing like that and I am really impressed.  This album is not repetitive or boring.  He plays all the songs from the CD twice.  It is really a lovely sound, for one that is not repeated.  I love the songs on this album.  I think Tony Bennett should have won 3 Grammy awards already.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

I really don't like it when I start listening to it, and by the time I finish it I don't like it anymore. I think this album is good, but it's kind of too cheesy for me, but I don't think it's a bad album.

I agree with everything I've read so far. I give it a four out of five stars.

Amazon reviewer: I have only listened to a few of his albums, but for a while I was a fan. In the first few weeks after his new album was released I was waiting for his next album because I was so sure this one was going to be good. I was very disappointed. I think his albums are very good, but this album (and his other albums) really are too cheesy for me, even his other albums. His albums are very good, but this album really is too cheesy for me. I don't understand why people think this album is so good. It's really not. This is a very bad album.

Amazon review: The soundtrack is not bad, but the song is a little annoying, and i can't help but notice that all the songs are just very generic songs like "let the good times roll", "let's go", and "let me call you when im done". and i can't help but notice that almost all the songs have very little to do with the movie. I can understand the movie, but the song is just annoying and ruins the experience.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I did not like this movie, and I did not like this Soundtrack either. The music is OK, and I think I can see the point of using various styles of music to make the movie. The lyrics are very generic, and have little to do with the story. I think the movie is about the power of love, and the music is just a distraction.
