Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I have to say that I'm a fan of the God Squad. It's one of the only CDs I've had from them that I would actually listen to. I also really dig the way they mix different styles together. It's just like a DJ mixing a beat. I'm not a big fan of their remixes though. I think part of the problem with them is that they don't use the original recordings or the original producers. They just take the best bits of it and remix them. The vocals are a bit dated as well, as is the whole sound of the CD. I think I'm going to pass on all their remixes. I'll only buy their original productions.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the fact that the God Squad have finally released a CD. It's still not a new CD but it's a CD that has some decent songs on it. There's not a lot of new material in this CD but there are a few decent songs all together. I think that the songs they have put on this CD are a bit of a mixed bag. Some really good songs that I like, some songs that I don't really care for. The vocals are alright, but when you listen to it you can't hear it. The sound quality on this CD is pretty decent.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I'm glad someone finally got the right amount of music out of this album that I was looking for. The songs all have a really unique sound. The only reason I gave this album a 4 is because the song I didn't like was so good that it had to be on the album. I could listen to this album all day long.

Amazon reviewer: I was a little disappointed by this album. It was recorded a good few months after the release of the band's previous album, so the songs didn't sound as fresh as they used to.

Amazon review: Nice, clean, crisp sound, with some nice high notes. I was surprised at how good the sound is when I listened to this one, and I am glad I have had it! I've been listening to this one since I bought it in the early 90's when I was really into folk music. Now I am listening to this one while I drive to my job in the morning. I'm glad I bought it. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm glad I did. I like a lot of the songs, but my favorite is probably the song "The World She Made," written by Rob Zombie. This is very different from the other songs I listen to, and it is a very good one. It is the only song I have never heard. I am not a fan of the lyrics, but the music is very good. I have to say, this is my fourth album by this band, and they have never disappointed me. I am very impressed with them, and I will be buying more of their music. It sounds as if they really want to make something great, and I think they are just beginning to do it. I am so happy to have found them. I love this band.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Hey guys, here's a new song I made with some help I got from the internet and I hope you like it. 

The lyrics are pretty simple. Just want to tell you that it's pretty much what was on my mind that night.

It has a slow tempo but it's still a good song. I don't really have any ideas on the chords yet. I'm going to look at the notes to see if I can get them to sound right.

Once again, I'm not really sure what to name this song. I thought of a few name's, but I just can't decide.

I hope you like it.

The music in this song is pretty simple. Just a few keys and chords.

I think I'll put the chord charts on here and I'll list the chords and their names, but you can probably figure it out.

Thanks again for listening.

Peace and Love,

Shawn

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would recommend finding a different version to download.  I absolutely love this song, it has good sound quality, BUT they cut off the entire last word/note!  It drives me crazy and really ruins the track.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a decent song, I think.  For the most part.  But it's just too short.  I don't even know what it's called.  And it's a really short song.  It has the best guitar solo of the songs on the album.  So I'm really bummed that this song was cut for being too short.  It should have been an extended song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm really disappointed.  This song is one of the worst songs on the album.  It's nothing special.  The lyrics are poorly written.  The guitar solo is very good.  It's a very good song.  But the lyrics are terrible.  And the guitar solo is one of the best on the album.  It's one of the best solos I've ever heard in my life.

Amazon review: I enjoy Keith Sweat's music.  I don't have anything negative to say.  I love Keith Sweat, but I feel like his new CD doesn't even use the songs he used to sing on his first cd.  I really liked his song "Sugar Baby."  It was a really good song.  But it's just not used on his new cd.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: The soundtrack to this movie is great! I really like all the songs, but the one that stood out to me the most is the one with the "bitch song" sung by the character of Lisa.

So there are even more songs than the movie has. I also really like the "Stacy's Mom" song.

I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Fantastic product from Amazon. The high quality music that I have downloaded at no cost has been of great help to me at the moment. I am unable to hear my own voice, but I am able to hear the music of the background music in my games. This product is a great product for a person who likes to relax and enjoy their games and they have the money to afford this product.

I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and this product also makes it more enjoyable and I think it is worth buying.

This is a very good product. I have downloaded a lot of music from Amazon and I like this product because it has many music from my favorite artists. The sound quality is good also.

As an Amazon Customer Service representative, I can tell you that this product is excellent. It is worth $29.00 and you get over 1,000 songs.

I would recommend it to anyone. My husband has a Kindle Fire, and I use my Kobo Aura HD. I really like the Kobo Aura HD, and it is very easy to read. Also, I would recommend this product to anyone who likes reading books on their Kindle Fire or on their Kobo Aura HD.

I'm a big fan of the PS books, and I'm a big fan of the PS video games. When I purchased the first season of the PS3, I used the Sony PS3 game. After about two months when I was not using the game as much, I decided to download the PS3 game to my Sony PS3. I downloaded a lot of songs, and I found that this game makes it better for me to play my PS3 when I have downloaded that game to my PS3.

I would recommend this game to anyone like myself who has a Sony PS3.

This product is excellent! It has a very impressive selection of music from some of my favorite artists. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I have been using this product everyday for the past week and I feel like a new man.

The music is great. I have played this product for over an hour this morning and I feel like playing it for a few hours more.

The only problem I have is that the music sounds a little quiet and not as loud as I would like it to be. I think I would like to be able to listen to a little more of the music that I have downloaded.

I have been a fan of the PS3 since I got it, and I have been purchasing different types of music to add to my library on my Sony PS3 since the PS3 first arrived on the market in December 2005. I had an original PS3, but I was not able to play any games on it. I purchased a second PS3 and I had a great time playing games and downloading music on my second PS3.
