Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The first thing to say is that this concerto is a gem.  I have rarely heard a Bach piece that is so beautifully written as this one.  Bach has a way of making you feel like you are experiencing something, in your body, that is very personal.  Although I have a love hate relationship with Bach, I have always been a fan of him, and this concerto is no exception.  And when I say concerto I am speaking of the first movement, which is the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the work of George Shearing for years, and it is great to see him receiving the recognition he deserves.  I cannot say enough that everything he does is always so interesting, and the musicality of his pieces is just fantastic.  I would be very happy to have him come back to the Bay Area sometime, and play with our orchestra.  He is one of those rare artists who can do it all: compose, play, arrange, and teach.

Amazon review: I don't know what it is about classical music, but I can listen to it for hours on end and not get tired.  I don't care what country you come from, classical music is always better than country music.  It is very relaxing  just sitting back and listening to it makes my day.

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to the new album by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  The music is beautiful.

It is very affordable and is a great way to start your collection.

Amazon review:  George Shearing's music is like no other.  A few years ago I would not have believed the power of the music, but today I am a huge fan.  He is a composer, performer, teacher, and teacher and performer.  This collection is a fantastic introduction to his work.  If you are looking for his work, this is the album.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of Sir Edoardo Pavesi and have always heard his work.  On this CD he and his orchestra played two of his best works, two of his favorite compositions.

All in all, a very enjoyable listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The vocals are lovely, and I like the album overall. I was hoping that I could learn more about this artist, but I didn't really find anything. The only information I found on Wikipedia was that he is a choral artist. He sings mostly classical music. I thought that was a pretty good summary of the artist. I hope he is just a singer. His music is a great addition to the classical music genre. I would definitely give him a chance if I ever meet him.

Amazon review: This album is amazing. I've listened to all of the songs over and over and I just love the voice of each of the boys.

Amazon review: I like this soundtrack for the movie "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" the music fits the drama.

I hate it when I do not listen to something on repeat for awhile I was listening to this song everyday, just about to move on to the next song but now I have to wait 15 mins. And to be honest I do not like the lyrics in this song, they sound creepy.

I've been listening to this song on repeat for the past 5 years. The lyrics of this song are just as creepy as they were when I read the book. I have tried listening to it in the car and on the way to work but I just can't get myself to do it. It's the only song I don't like and it's the only song sung in Swedish!

I have never read the book but I love this song. I listened to it everyday for almost a year. And I even remember the lyrics of the song. The music is beautiful and makes me think that this is a real love song I hear in the last verse.

This is a love song. For a long time I could not understand what the song was telling me but it's so beautiful and sad that I feel like crying. For me this song is really special.

I was listening to this song on my way to work the other day. I felt so sad about something and I just felt like I had to listen to this song. It makes me think of how much things would be different if I could see the world through someone else eyes.

This song is sooo beautiful. I can't stop listening to it. I feel like its the best song I have ever heard. I love this song it is so beautiful and deep. I love the line "I'm not what you expected". I love the song because it has the power to make me realize what I did wrong.

This is a really beautiful song. It really shows a different side of the artist. I think its amazing how the music comes out of the same person and has so many different aspects.

I like this song. I feel like its the best song I have ever heard. I can really relate to the lyrics and it makes me think of how much things would be different if I could see what life is all about.

This song is so beautiful. I love the guitar. I love the way it just makes me feel like I am in the music or something.

I have listened to this song on repeat just about everyday for the past 3 years I have been listening to it. Its been a really good song for me. I love the chorus of this song. I love the song because it has the power to make me realize what i did wrong.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed reading about the creation of this CD, as well as the music of these fine artists.  It is an eye-opener to see how much talent and skill are put into the making of music.

Amazon review: Although I love the music of the Beatles, and have listened to all of their albums many times, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this CD.  It is one of the worst Beatles' albums I have heard in a long time.  The vocals have a very high, shrill quality to them.  I would recommend purchasing this CD to those who are Beatles' fans but not to fans of good music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This recording is just ok. I am sorry but I have to tell you that. I love the Beatles and I have listened to all their albums many times but this CD just doesn't do them any justice.  The Beatles have the best vocal harmonies of any of the groups I have ever heard.  I have loved them since the early 60's.  If you love them as much as I do I suggest you buy this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review:  This is a great group.  The Beatles would be my favorite, but I love this group much more.  They have great harmonies and there are a lot of songs they have not recorded, but they are great songs and one of them is a classic.  I have also heard that this album was made with the intention of being a collector's item, which is good and bad.  I'm a huge Beatles fan, but I am not a fan of collecting their albums.  I just like to listen to what I like and will not listen to everything that comes on the radio.  I also like to listen to the radio only when I am driving.  I have bought many many CDs in the past and have never had a problem with them.  I was really curious about this CD and I have now listened to it three times.  It is not the greatest CD I have ever heard, but it is still a good one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I am not a big Beatles fan, but I really enjoy the music.  I have been listening to them for years and I don't know that I have ever come across a better album in my life.  I love the harmonies and the vocals are very high quality.  I am glad that they have given the Beatles back to us and this CD should help to bring back some of the old, classic songs that we have lost over the years.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This group is not for everyone, but those who are Beatles fans will love it.  The harmonies are awesome and the vocals are very high quality.  I have listened to this CD more than any other Beatles CD, but I don't know that I would call it a masterpiece.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

It is one of the best rock songs ever sung, and with lyrics like 'I got the world by the tail, and I'm the boss of the world,' it's just awesome. I was glad to have discovered this band, because they are a great, original, innovative band.

Amazon review: I don't know what to make of this album. I purchased this album from a local music shop in order to get a copy of "The Red Hot Chili Peppers" back from the store. When I received it, I opened it up and noticed that there were a few errors on the packaging. I contacted the store about the error, but they weren't willing to send a new copy. I then went into another store in an attempt to return the album and the manager of the store told me that they don't support that kind of thing and were going to contact the band. I went on to purchase the "The Red Hot Chili Peppers" album at another store and the same thing happened. The manager of the store I originally went to was very nice and offered to refund my money and send me a new copy, but I didn't want to do that because I thought that it wasn't worth it. I then went on to purchase the album at another store, but the manager there said the same thing. So I went to another store in a different town and the same thing happened. I'm pretty sure he was telling the truth, but I still don't know if they're just trying to squeeze as much money out of you as possible. I wouldn't recommend that you go with them.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The CD's sound terrific and the performances are a treat. But this CD is a train wreck. At least the performers sound like they're having a great time. But what they are doing is not music. The music is just not there. The melodies are not there. The harmonies are not there. The rhythms are not there. The vocals are just not there. And in all honesty, the album is only 4 discs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  A great album from one of my favorite artists.  This is just her 2nd album.  Not that I was expecting anything different, but I was hopeful that she was going to show more variety.  It seems she has.  Her debut was amazing, but the new songs are not as great.  I don't think I can add anything more to the album, but I do like the opening to the album. It's very different from the songs on the rest of the album.  It's like a nice little surprise in the beginning.  I like the new songs, but I can't say I'm enjoying them.  I think the album is better than the lead-up to the album.  This whole "twist" should have been left alone. It's just another twist, no different than the ones she has made before.  I don't think she has ever left a twist off of her albums.  It should have been left alone and it's not, so I'm done with it.  I guess I still like the album and I still enjoy her music, but I can't get into it.  I need something different.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I'm going to start this off by saying that I love this.  I love her voice, I love her lyrics, I love the music and I love the videos.  Unfortunately, I don't think this has the same amount of energy that her other albums have.  I just don't get it.  I like that she's trying something new and I'm hoping that it will pay off.  I just have a feeling that it won't.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  This album just doesn't flow right for me.  It's very meh!  The only thing I like about it is the song "I Don't Believe You" and that's about it.  I don't know what happened.  I can't understand why this is my worst album.  I've listened to it a couple of times and I guess I just don't like it.  This is my second album for me and I just don't know what's wrong with me.  I really like Meghan Trainor.  I just don't like this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is horrible.  The album sounds like she is just trying to make a great song.  I don't like the song "I Don't Believe You" because I don't feel that it should be in the middle of the album.  She should have put it at the end and put all the other songs on the side.  It's also really boring.  The song "Lemonade" is another one that I don't like.  It's just nothing special.  There's only a couple of songs that I like.  I don't know what's going on.  I don't know why this album has come to be.  I think this album is terrible.  I just don't like it.  I don't understand why this album is so bad.  I just don't know what is wrong with me.

Amazon review:  This was the first time I have heard this album.  I thought it was a little boring but hey, they're not going to make a bad album.  If you don't like them, don't buy it.

I thought it was a little boring but hey, they're still creating their own style with this album.  I thought the album sounded different from all of the music that I've heard from her previously.  I liked the beginning of the album and I liked the ending of the album.  To me, it was all a bunch of different songs.  I liked the album.

Amazon review:  I think Meghan has outdone herself with this one.  This album is so unique and it's different from all of the songs she's put out before.  It's very refreshing.  I haven't heard anything like it.  I think it also helped her to get her name out there.  There's so much good music out there that she could have never gotten her name out there.  I really think that all of the songs on this album sound great.  I can't say that I don't like some of them.  I just don't like the rest of the songs that I've heard from her previously.  I didn't think this album was that bad.  I thought it was very good.  I thought the album was a little different.  It was new to

This is an interesting album. Not as good as the first one, but not as bad as the second.

A little annoying lyrics, but not a deal breaker for me.

Love this.

I will admit that it was not as good as the first album. I am giving it a 5/5 because it is so short. The songs are great.

I will admit also that the lyrics are a little annoying. I cannot say that they are annoying because I am not a huge fan of the song lyrics, but they are just slightly annoying

The songs are great.

I love it.

Sentiment: Positive

I would rather listen to this than the first. I would rather the songs were longer. I do not love the lyrics, but I love the music.

This is a great album. I love all of the songs on this album, but this is my favorite.

I have never listened to the lyrics, so I cannot really say what they are like; however, they seem to be more personal than the second CD.

This is the only album I have ever owned that I have listened to more than once.

I recommend this CD. It is worth the money.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
