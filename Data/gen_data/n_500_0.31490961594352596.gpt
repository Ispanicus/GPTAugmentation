Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: This is an excellent album, and I am quite delighted to find it. It was just what I needed to brighten up my mood in the morning. I've spent many years listening to albums and listening to music with my wife. I do not have the heart to give up this music, and I will continue to listen to it. It is a truly fantastic, and very easy listening album. I have played the album many times and have been able to listen to it again and again. The songs are easy to play, and the arrangement of all of the songs makes a lot of sense. It has a beautiful sound. We have a wonderful, and very enjoyable relationship, and listening to this album makes it so much better. I have had almost everyone in my family listen to this album, and it has enhanced our relationship more than any other album. I've had people tell me how much they have enjoyed this album, and I've listened to the CD many times, and listened to it over and over again. I really like it, and have played it on a number of occasions. I am a fairly young man, and am easily influenced by wonderful sounds, and this album has done more for me than any other album. I am a fan, and will continue to be a fan, and listen to it many times over the years.

Amazon review: The music on this CD is very well composed, and the songs are well arranged. The only disappointment is that the album is not longer. It would have given it a "second life". But it is a terrific CD, and I am sure that many will enjoy it.

Amazon review: A great CD, but the only disappointment is that the CD is just too short. I wanted to listen to it more than once, but I have had to return it. It would have been more than a "second life" but it would have been a different kind of record.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I have listened to the CD a few times over the years and have always enjoyed it.

I love classical music, and am glad I have found some good classics to listen to.

I have had this album for years and have only now heard that the tracks are available on CD. I am glad I bought this CD. The album is not very long, but the arrangements are outstanding. I am really enjoying the album, and love the fact that there is no repeat of the songs. I have only listened to it once, but I have heard it before and it was worth the purchase of this CD. I will listen to it over and over again. I am glad I bought this CD.

Amazon review: I love her music, it's great to listen to. She is one of the great singers in the world right now. I love playing her songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always loved the sound of Tom Waits.  That is, until this new album came out.  I'm not a fan of his.  I thought this album was fine.  It's different.  It's good.  It's not Waits.  But he is a great artist.  I'll give him that.  I'm not too thrilled by his new album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the way this guy sings.  He's so funny.  And he's not too bad with the guitar either.  It's just that his singing is too often all over the place and not centered.  And I think the songs are a little weak.  But his singing is great.  And the guitar playing is just so... good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  It's one of my favorites.  And I've been playing it since I bought it.  Maybe I'm just a fan of the guy who wrote it.  I like his music too.  But this is not the album I've been waiting for.  I think it's a good album.  But it's not the one I thought it would be.  I think I'll still play it.  But maybe I'll be happier with the one that came out before this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: This is the best Drifters album I have ever heard.  I have been searching for years for an original Drifters album that was as good as this.  I have owned all of the re-issues and all are good, but this is better then all of them.  It is one of the best albums I have ever owned.  I am very disappointed in the re-issues.  I have purchased every Drifters album since the beginning and none of them are as good as this.  The only ones that are better were the re-issues.  I cannot believe they released this after it had been out for more then 25 years.  They should have just re-issued it since it is so good.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

This album is good, it has some good tracks, but the first three tracks are way too long. I listen to them as a background noise to my music. I don't know what this album is either, the only thing I know it isn't is the song that it is self. It's good, but it isn't perfect. Don't waste your money, Brian.

This album is good, I am glad I bought it. I really don't know what it is. It's really good. It's got some good tracks, but the first three tracks are way too long. The songs are pretty upbeat and interesting, and the only thing I did not like was that they were not very good at singing in English. I really do not know what this album is, but it is good.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: I hate songs like this.  I don't want to listen.  I don't want to talk about it.  I just want them to stop.  I don't want to hear all the lyrics, it's too hard to sing along with.  I don't want to hear the chorus.  I don't want to hear any of the lyrics, it's impossible.  I want to make them stop.  This song is just plain annoying.  It's like the person who wrote this is mentally handicapped.  It makes me sick to my stomach.  I really hope that it's a joke.  I don't want to listen to this again.

Amazon review: What a horrible song.  The song isn't even close to being catchy or original.  The lyrics are horrible.  The lyrics are so lame and I don't even care to hear them.

Amazon review: I love the tune, but it's horribly written.  For a song that's supposed to be so catchy, it's so bad.  The lyrics are awful, with the worst pun I've seen on lyrics in a long time.  I can't believe this is number 6!  It's a waste of time.  I can't imagine anyone listening to this and being happy.  I'm shocked that a song that's supposed to be so catchy, is so bad. How can you even write something that bad?  There's no way to sing along with this, it's too bad.  You'd think they would make this better.  I wish they would just let someone else write this.

The best of the best

This is one of those songs that I have been able to listen to over and over again, because it is so good it makes me want to listen to more of their work.

I do have to say that I was a bit disappointed with the sound quality of the CD as the music is very clear and has a nice sound to it.

I would recommend this to anyone in the mood for a mellow song.

I will be buying the CD in order to see what else the band has written in the future.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

BORBID (BEST OF THE BEST) (2014)

This song is the BEST of the Best of the Best of BORBID.

I've been a huge fan of BORBID since I first heard them in the early '80's, and they've always remained one of my favorites. I like their early stuff much better, but their new stuff is very good. The song is a bit of a throwback, but not too bad!

This song is a bit like a cross between "I'll Fly Away" and "A Thousand Miles."

I love this song, and I really like the song, but the lyrics make me feel like I don't want to ever speak to a certain member of the band. They make me feel like it's not true.

This song is a little different than the typical BORBID song, it's not really the same melody or the same kind of lyrics. It's a

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: I do not care about the fact that they are a boy band.  I do not care about the fact that they are a boy band. They are a boy band and that's all there is to it.  This is their first album that I have ever bought.  It was released in the summer of 1999 and I got it around the end of 1998.  It is a good album.  I do not like the fact that it is a boy band.  They are nice looking guys, I have no problem with them, but boy bands are not my thing.  I'm sorry, but this album is full of bad singers.  They sing as if they were born to sing like this.  I'm sorry, but this is the worst album I have ever heard.  It is a shame.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it!

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: What a lazy production from Pink Floyd as it's supposed last album. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.
