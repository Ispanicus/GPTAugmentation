Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Musical Review: Positive

This song is one of the best. It is the best song on the album. The lyrics make you feel like you're on a bus, or a train, or whatever. The lyrics are a little long, and you wouldn't mind reading the lyrics or not listening, which is the way it should be. I would recommend this to anyone who likes old songs.
Sentiment: Positive

This song is great. I'm not a huge fan of this song, but I could listen to it any day. The chorus is amazing, and the rest of the song is great as well. It's all a little different from the rest of the songs on this album, but it is definitely one of the best songs on the album.
Sentiment: Positive

This is the third song that I have heard. The lyrics are really cute, and I really liked them. The chorus is really good. The only problem is that there is an instrumental bridge at the end. The bridge is not as great as the rest of the song, but I can still listen to the song if I just skip the bridge.
Sentiment: Positive

The song is great, and I like the chorus. It gives you a little bit of a feel. The lyrics are fun. This song is a great song for your wedding.
Sentiment: Positive

This is an old song, but it's a pretty good one. A good message for any relationship, and a great song to remember your happy moments from the past.
Sentiment: Positive

This is a very good song, and if you listen to the whole song, you will see why. The lyrics are really good, and the song makes you feel like you're a little kid. They are very cute. They are very short, and you have to really listen to them.
Sentiment: Positive

This is an old song, and you really need to listen to it because it's very cute. It's a classic, and I have listened to it many times. I like the song, but it's not my favorite. I would recommend buying the album, because the song is on there.

Amazon review: I have been looking forward to this album for a while. After listening to it, I can say this is an album that may actually be really good.  This album is a really good example of where artists can go wrong. I know it's easy to say that, but I'm not going to say anything bad about this album.  It has a lot of great songs on it and they are all exceptional.  It may not be the best in the world, but it's not the worst either.  I think the best thing about this album is that it seems like they're just making an album and not trying to win a Grammy.  It's a great album of great songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There's some good stuff here, and a lot of it is pretty good, but, as with most other indie labels, the quality and consistency are often poor.  I think I'd have to recommend this for a friend searching for a cheap, well-done album, but I wouldn't buy this myself.  I'd recommend them to others with a good ear, but I wouldn't recommend buying this CD for yourself.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this recently and find it to be a mixed bag.  The music is all over the map, and the vocals seem to come and go, so I'd recommend either buying this album to get the best "feel" you can out of it, or you can just listen to the CD to enjoy the music.  I also don't hear much from the horns.  I also don't see any harm in buying this CD, the only time I don't buy albums is when I get a bad one.  I like the music on The Dandy Warhols and The Cramps, but I don't like this CD.  However, as I've said, I don't own a CD player (or I have one, but haven't listened to it since I got it), so I can't tell you what I think about the music.  I don't personally care for the style of music.  I'm not a fan of the vocals.  I'm not a fan of the songs.  I just don't care for the music.  I'm a fan of the music, but I'm not a fan of the music.

Amazon review: I love this band, have been listening to them since I was in the 3rd grade and they hold a special place in my heart and I wouldn't change a thing. I bought my first CD from them while I was in high school and I have been hooked ever since.  I have to say though that I do not recommend this CD for everyone, I would recommend it for those who you just can't get enough of their music.  I have loved every song since the very first time I heard them.  I have been so blessed to have a few favorite songs from this band and I will say that I have probably listened to this CD over 100 times and I still love every song.  I would buy this CD again and again.  I think this album deserves to be in the top 5 bests of all time.  I still have yet to hear a song that I don't love.  I still love them.  I still listen to them.  I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: I love this band.  They do a lot of different styles of music and are very varied.  I enjoy their music.  I've bought all of their albums except one.  That was the one time I didn't like the CD because it wasn't what I wanted.  I don't know if you've ever tried to listen to their music, but they don't sound like anyone else's music.  They sound like they just stepped off the street and said, "Here, listen to this stuff, I just picked up this riff and decided to play it."  It's funny.  They do get a little repetitive in their songs, but it's a good thing because it makes it more fun.  They have some very good songs on this CD, and a few I wouldn't have thought to buy on their own.  This album is definitely worth owning.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I was a little disappointed with the first album.  I don't know why, but I felt like it really was a little less powerful, and the melodies just didn't ring true.  But, this one is definitely a step up.  I love the way that the music changes with different tempos.  And, at the end of the album, there is an instrumental track that is just a mash up of different different genres.  I can't really describe it, but I just love it.  The lyrics are really good, and I like that the vocals are a little more varied.  I feel like it could be a little more aggressive, but its not.  I think that the album sounds better than most songs from other bands I have heard.  The guitar and the vocal harmonies really make up the music.  I really love it.  I have heard their first two albums.  They both had great music, but this has a little more energy and a little more passion.  I feel like it could have been a little more intense, but it is still really great.  I was listening to this album while I was cleaning the house, and I decided to check my email.  This is where I found out that this was in my email.  What I really liked about this album was the lyrics.  They are great.  What I didn't like was, it seems like they had some type of "pop song" on there, which just seemed a little cheesy.  The songs really are really good.  I love their song "No More I Love You"  It's a really good song.  I really like the way the vocals are mixed together and the way that the music changes with different tempos.  The last song on the album which is a instrumental track, is a mash up of different different genres, and I really love the way that the guitar and the harmonies really make up the music.  This album is great.  I have to say that I have heard all of the three albums, but I really like this one better.  I really like the fact that the music changes with different tempos and the lyrics are really good.  The vocals are mixed really well and the acoustic guitar and vocals really make up the music.  I actually love this album.  I would definitely buy the next one.  I feel like this band has a lot of potential.  They should do an album like this and do a few more.  I really think that their next album could be really good.  I am really, really, really excited.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a little more mellow and soft.  You can really hear how they can write a song.  The song "A Simple Thing" is one of the best songs from their first album.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is really good.  The song "A Simple Thing" is really good and one of the best songs on the CD.  The song "It's All About You" is also really good.  The only song that I didn't like was "A Simple Thing."  The guitar and the vocals are really good but the lyrics are a little on the cheesy side.  The lyrics really don't make up the music.  I like the way that the songs change with different tempos.  I have to say that I have been hearing this CD on the radio for the past 3 months now and I still don't know what the song is about.  I never really understood what the song was about.  The lyrics are great, but the music was a little weak.  I really like the guitar and the vocals.  The vocals work perfectly together.  I think that this CD could have been better if they had written a little more.  The guitars and the vocals are really good together.  The lyrics and the guitars are really good together.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Lyrics of the song "The Good Wife" by Lin Manuel Miranda are pretty good.  The song is not one of the biggest hits in the book.

Amazon review: The song "The Good Wife" is a good song.  The song has good lyrics, good melody, and good harmony.  The song does have a fast beat and its a nice song to listen to to get to know it better.  The chorus is great and has good lyrics, but its the lyrics that are the best.  The chorus is about a girl who is in love with someone else, but is in love with someone else.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: The title of this album says it all.  I'd have to say that Robert Johnson is one of the very worst singers I've ever heard of.  I don't know who put him together with Sam Cooke and they let him go on.  I don't know if he is a good singer or not, but I will never listen to any music of his again.  I don't know what happened to him.  He is just so boring and his singing is just like nothing you'll ever hear in your life.  I am not going to listen to him ever again.  I don't know if he is good or not, but I still say, good riddance.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first time I listened to this album, I thought this guy could really sing.  Then I heard one of his songs, "Lonely Man" and I have to say he sounds like a total asshole.  And this album will just fill the hole you have left in your heart.  If you are looking for a singer with a lot of soul, this is probably not the album for you.  I will say, however, that he has a lot of talent to sing.  It's just the songs that are just completely boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Robert Johnson's music has always been one of the only artists that I truly appreciate, and I'm sorry to hear that he's fallen through the cracks.  His voice is a little rough, but it's always been one of my favorites.  I'm not sure why he's fallen by the wayside, but he's always been a great artist, and an even better songwriter.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this album could have been better than it was.  Some of the songs are very decent, and a lot of the songs are quite good.  However, there's just not a lot of substance to it.  Other than that, I really liked the songs.  I don't have much of an opinion on Robert Johnson, but he did a good job with this album.  I would say this album has a lot of potential as a great album, but with a lot of things that they should've fixed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that this album is a lot better than any of his other albums.  I know he is on a lot of people's lists, but if you want to get to know him, you should listen to his songs and listen to his live performances.  I am glad I found this album.  He is one of the best singers I have ever heard.  I really love his voice.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Robert Johnson is one of the greatest singers of all time.  His voice is so unique.  He makes you feel like you are in the middle of the blues.  Just his voice and his style of singing, it's just really amazing.  He is one of my favorite singers.  He is going to be a huge star.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've never really appreciated black musicians until now. I've always been a fan of soul, gospel, R&B, blues.  Just not a fan of the whole rap and hip hop thing.  He is one of the best artists you can ever listen to.  He has a great voice, excellent talent, a nice and smooth flow, a beautiful guitar playing, and an incredible body of work.  He has a very unique sound and a unique style.  This is one of his best albums. Great singer, great guitar, great song, great album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what to think of this album.  I can understand why someone would want to write a book about this group.  But to me the music they are singing sounds more like a choir than a band.  Their voices are all very similar sounding and it is nothing like any other group I have heard.  I liked the music and the singing but not the music for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If anyone knows the name of this band, please give me the name.  I have been listening to them recently and can't get enough.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been looking for a group called the Loves of the World and this is the only one I have found.  I love the music they make and the vocals are really beautiful.  I think this is the best group I have ever heard.  Their music is very soothing and has a lot of emotion in it.  If you've never heard them, you are missing a treat.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I had to buy this album for my wife.  She has been searching for the group she grew up with and found them.  It is the perfect album for people like her who loves music that is full of feeling.  If you are looking for music to help you get through a tough time in your life, this is it!  I am buying all of their albums.  If you are looking for a great album to listen to when you are feeling down, this is it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I first heard this group when I was in high school and was immediately interested.  I have been listening to them ever since.  They have been releasing albums for a number of years and they have been recording for over 10.  Now they have released their 10th album.  The band has been a constant in my life since I first heard them.  I have seen them play many times, either at a college concert or even in their own band.  This is their first cd to do the cover song thing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I don't know if I would call this a "hit" but it is a top seller.  It is a great album and I think a lot of people will be pleasantly surprised.  What I don't like about the album is that it is very overproduced.  It sounds like you're listening to a band that's been playing the same song for over a year.  I think to a lot of people that is what it is, just different.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a real gem!  This is one of the first albums I have ever heard from this group.  In fact, I have never heard of them before and I had to buy this album.  It is a great album and I feel like I have found a new favorite group.  I would give this album 100's out of 100.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: What a great album.  This is the band's first album that I have heard.  I am so glad I chose to buy it.  I have been listening to it all week.  I like the way the vocals are blended together.  This is the perfect album for people who love a great sound with a good mix of music and vocals.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been looking for a country group like this for a long time.  I would love to hear a group that is a little different, but still has a country sound.

Amazon review: For the last few years there has been a lot of radio promotion for "the world's greatest hip-hop/rap album". The problem is, there is not one track on there that is more than 2 minutes in length. It is a shame, because there are a lot of great songs on the album. Unfortunately, the album's release date was pushed back.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've used this CD to play on my car radio. It's good music. I like the fact that the song "Cherry Blossom" isn't played on the radio anymore. I think he has a better track on his CD. The tracks on this CD are good and the album as a whole is good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The last few years have seen a lot of hip-hop. Some of it good, some of it not so good. But the album "One of a Kind" is a good product. It is a product of a good artist who is a rapper. As a whole the album is good. The tracks are good, but there is no "hit".
