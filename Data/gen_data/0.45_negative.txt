Amazon review: "Sigh. Conor, what happened?  For the past decade you've given us the most amazing lyrics, the most stripped down (or fancifully gussied up) tunes and then you go and drop this mess on us?  Your albums prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but "The People's Key" does nothing to advance the dialogue...stilted lyrics, out of place electro effects and a rambling, incoherent vein throughout make this one to pass on and pretend it never happened.  A little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around, gentlemen.  Signed, Someone who gave all your other albums 5 stars and would have given "Lifted" 6 stars if that were possible.  Your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music as well as the overwhelming let-down factor."
