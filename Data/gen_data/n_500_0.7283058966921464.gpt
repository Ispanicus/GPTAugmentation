Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing.

This is my first review, so please take it easy. :)
This is my first review, so please take it easy. :) I bought a digital copy of this album and downloaded the free MP3 download and I must say, I am very dissapointed in the quality of the music. For the price of a CD, I would expect the music to be much better. The songs are all very short. I don't know if the music was recorded in one take, or if the music was recorded on several takes and then mixed down. The music has a very low quality and it takes a while to get to the end of the songs.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments.

Amazon review: The song is so boring and the song writer is just a pretender.  They didn't write the song and they can't even write a decent song.  Then he tries to say how this is the greatest song ever written and how he is the greatest song writer in the world and all that bull.  He writes that he is a genius and has all the greatest writers and now he has to write a song.  It's really lame.  Now I know what it's like to have a kid who can't write a decent song.  It's embarrassing.  It's like a child who can't write a decent paper or a child who can't write a decent essay.  I feel sorry for the kid.  That's what this song is.

Amazon review: Really great song.  I like the way it's written and the way it's sung.  It is sung by a great singer (sally) and a great song writer (jim).  It shows the power of the song writer.  The last time I listened to this song I was sitting on a plane in Houston and I was very happy because I was listening to a great song and a great song writer.  This song is an hour long and has a great chorus.  It's very repetitive.  I like it.  I think it's a very good song.  The only thing I don't like is that there is a lot of repeat singing.  And the sound is very distorted.  I would like to hear the song in a studio better.  The first time I heard that song I thought it was really good.  It was so different and the sound was so different.  The sound was like listening to a cassette tape.  It's a very good song.

Amazon review: I enjoy the album but the production is not very good.  I had to put this album on my mp3 player and listen to it every day for 3 weeks.  I have not been able to get through this album and I don't feel that I can ever listen to it again.

Amazon review: This is a great CD, but it is a generic compilation of "reggae" songs and not very good.  It does not represent the diversity of Jamaican music.  The song "Ghetto Child" sounds like a Jamaican version of "I Will Survive."  The song "Chains" is pretty good.  "Jamaica" is good, but I think the song is a cover of a Jamaican song.  I think that the album is not very good because of the generic nature of the music.

Amazon review: I love the music.  I hope to see more albums like this.  The sound is unique, and I have not heard this many tracks of hip hop in such a short period of time. The music is great.  The only negative I have is the sound quality.  I think that the sound quality is not good.  The songs are too slow and it sounds like there is some distortion of the sounds.  It is a real pain to listen to.

Amazon review:  I do not know what I've been doing for the past week or so, but I've been listening to a lot of Leonard Cohen's music. The first song on this list is very good. I think it's the best song of his I've heard.  It's very simple. A bit like a lullaby.  The second song I found quite interesting. It seems to be the only song that was written by Amy Macdonald, which is very interesting.  I found it to be very haunting.  This is the only song that I found that I've listened to and enjoyed, yet still wanted to listen to the background music.  I would love to hear Amy Macdonald's voice on this song.  She has a very beautiful voice. I think it would be great for her to sing this song.  In my opinion, Leonard Cohen is one of the most talented voices in music today.  I think if he had a song that he would like to record, it would be this one.

I used to sing to my daughter when she was little.

I think this song would be great for Amy Macdonald to sing.

I hope they would let her record this song.

I don't know who you are, but I enjoy your posting, so I'll cut you a little bit of slack. I have some thoughts as to why this song is a good one, and why it's good to hear it.

First off, the instrumentation is very simple. There are no drums, no guitars, no keyboards, no synths. The only real accompaniment is the sound of the guitar. I think this keeps the song from becoming too much of a 'rock' song, which is the only thing Amy Macdonald is known for. The

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this record. It's a bit of a departure from his previous albums, in that it's a bit more polished and more varied-yet I still enjoyed his work.  I didn't think his voice was particularly good, but he's done a good job of making me love his voice.  It's not clear to me what it is that he's doing wrong, but I still enjoy the music.  I think his voice is really unique and really beautiful.  It helps that it's the only album he's done that I know of that features a female vocalist.

I also like "I've Got A Question" and "I'm Not Gonna Let You Go".  I don't know if I'm going to purchase this album because I'm not interested in buying too many albums.  I still need to find another artist to listen to.  I like the album but there are some things that I don't like- his singing and the fact that he doesn't play guitar that well.

It's "Love Song" and it's a great song, but it's hard to pick a favorite.  I don't think I would have liked it if it wasn't for the lyrics.  You can't really put it down.  It's a beautiful song.  "Never Gonna Let You Go" is also very good, but not as good as "Love Song".  It's a great song and I'm glad I bought this album.  I don't think I would have bought it if it wasn't for the album.

So, what is it about her music that I like?  It's kind of silly.  Is it the music?  Is it the lyrics?  Is it her tone of voice?  I don't know, but it's something.  I don't know if it's her voice or what it is, but I like it.  It's a combination of all of the above.

Amazon review: This is the second time I have bought this record and I am enjoying it.  I was a little hesitant to buy it this time because I have been listening to a lot of Billy's music, and he's been a little inconsistent on his releases and his voice doesn't seem to be as good as the first time I bought the album, but since I listened to the album a few more times  and when I listened to it for the first time and then listened to it again, he sounded better.  So, I thought I would give him another chance.  I am going to buy another copy of the CD and I am going to put it on my "to buy" list.  I am going to listen to more of his music.  This is the second album that I've bought this year that I've really liked.  I'll let you know what I think after I listen to it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Death Cab, the only rock band I like anymore and have enjoyed for the last few years, put out a great album. I got my copy a couple of weeks ago and I am very happy with it. I was a fan of the band since I was a kid and have been a fan ever since. I am glad Death Cab decided to go on what I hope is their last tour. I don't really like the new song they have put out, but they are still a great band with great songs. The new album was great. There was one song I listened to the whole time and that was "My House".
