Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are a fan of 70s music and want a little something different, like an indie or something different you will enjoy this album.  It's not your typical 70s pop.  You will definitely love it.  It's not a bad one at all by any means.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer Leslie Rasmussen blames a rape victim

###
Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I can't say that I really enjoyed this album. I guess I'm not that picky with music. I wouldn't say I dislike it, but it's not something I will listen to on a regular basis. The songs definitely have some good energy, but for the most part, it just doesn't have the sound that I like in an album. The sound is not too heavy and the songs do have some good moments. However, it just doesn't have that overall sound that I like in an album.

Amazon review: I really liked this album. I think it's one of the best from the 90's. I think the lyrics are pretty interesting. I also think the songwriting is really good for a band in the 90's.

Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

The Best Of BOC. The Greatest Hits. One of the best live albums ever.

It's amazing what a good musician can do with an old record

The Best Of BOC is one of the greatest live albums ever. It captures the early 90's when BOC toured with the Allman Brothers Band. The band was known for their tight harmonies and the great harmonies they recorded on this album. The song "Can't Stop the Feeling" is the perfect example of BOC at the peak of their talent. They were on top of their game and the music and lyrics were superb.

I love that the album has been remastered by Jim Bealle. Some people consider him a "master" and I think he is a great one.

The album is available on Amazon. You can read my review on Amazon, but I'll just say this: this is one album to listen to over and over. I love this album.

Valerie is a very talented singer with a wonderful voice.  I have been listening to her for years, and she is one of my favorite singers today.  And, I have been a fan of her music for about 10 years.  I love her style.  I think she is the best singer of this generation.  I am a big fan of her music, and I love the way she sings.  I love that she sings in a low voice.  It's not overly high.  It's not low as in the song "I need a hug right now," but she sings it low.  I like how she sings it.  I have been a fan of her for many years.

I don't like the sound of her voice, and I don't think her voice is worth listening to.  I don't think anyone should listen to it.  I don't want to spend my life listening to this song.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

There are some songs, like the "I'll Be There" song, that I like.  But, it is not a very good album.  It is a mediocre album.  It is okay.  I do not think that this is a good album.

Amazon review:  Wow. I have to say that  this album is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had in music, or maybe in music at all.  This is the first album that I have purchased from Amazon.  I  could not resist the song "The Wall" and  I was not disappointed.  I love Bob Dylan, but I will not go into the album and just say that.  I will let the album speak for itself, and I will say that I had a great time  listening to this album the day it was  released.  I have not listened to it all the way through, only listening to the songs that I was able to get on CD.  So, if you're a Dylan fan, the album is definitely worth getting, or at least buying and listening to it slowly so that you feel the songs as you go.  The album really should have been released as a double album with all of the songs on one CD since it is so well done.  I will admit that the songs are a bit repetitive, but still the album is worth it.  If you love Bob Dylan, you will love this album.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I love Bob Dylan.  He's one of the best singers and songwriters I know of.  I used to be a fan of his music.  I didn't see him too often, but I liked what I heard.  When I first found out that he was going to do an album with this band, I was skeptical about the musicianship of the group.  I didn't want to listen to the songs I thought I was going to hear.  I did not like the sound of the voice. I felt that the group was too polished and too professional sounding, and the fact that I am not particularly a Dylan fan was a big hurdle.  I did not feel right investing $15.00 of my hard-earned money in this album.  The minute I heard them, I knew that I had made the right choice.  I like the fact that the album can be listened to at any time of the day or night.  I could sit down and listen to it in the morning or the  night before bed and still enjoy it.  In the summer, I can listen to it in the morning and then listen to it again in the evening.  I'm not the only one who feels like this.  Some people are very critical of  Dylan's music.  They think that he should make a more personal, acoustic album.  They don't understand that it's not just about the music.  I agree with many critics that his music is too polished, but I think if he is going to put out an album, he should do it in his own style.  It's not for everyone, but if you love Dylan, you'll like this album.  I was very excited about this album when it was released.  I was very excited to listen to it.  I have listened to it quite a bit and it has become my favorite album.  I could not wait to get the CD to listen to it.  I did put it on my CD player and played it to my husband.  I asked him if he liked it and he said, "I really want to like it, but it is a little too much for me.".  I asked him if he thought that he would like it, and he said, "No, I think I would find it boring.".  I had not planned to purchase it, but I was listening to the radio and I found out that he had purchased it.  I told him that I thought he should buy it and he said, "What do you mean, I shouldn't buy it?"  I asked him why he should buy it and he said, "Because you should not pay $15.00 for anything.".  I couldn't believe it.  I had to laugh.  I told him that was the cheapest CD I had ever purchased.  I also told him that I had to get it and that he could listen to it however he wanted, even though it was on his MP3 player.  I told him that I was going to listen to it tomorrow.  He called me and asked if I was listening to it.  I said "Yes, now I am."  He asked me if I was enjoying it and I told him that I was, but if he didn't want to listen to it, he could just turn it off.  I told him that he should buy it since he loves Dylan, and I told him that if he doesn't like it, he could take it back and he should be able to listen to it on his CD player without any interruption.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Lyrics to "Maniac" by The Dears

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I friend recommended this music to me and I fell in love. I love the honest, open worship. IF you enjoy Bethel type worship, then you will love Worshipmob. I can't wait for another CD by them.

Amazon review: Ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information.  Was not like the picture.  Returned 1st one and ordered a second which was identical to the first.  Also was returned.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first time I heard this CD I was convinced that there was an organist on the CD. I loved it. It was so fresh and new. The music is not repetitive and the sound is good. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves organ music.
