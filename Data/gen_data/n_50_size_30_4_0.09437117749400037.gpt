Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This album is very well done.  The voices are very clear and the instruments are well blended.  The vocal tracks alternate between a meditative and upbeat quality.  It is a good mix of genres.

Amazon review: After several listens to this CD I have come to the conclusion that I like this CD a lot.  This CD is a good representation of a lot of styles and a great alternative to "classical" music.  However, I have not yet found a way to "buy" this CD.  As a listener, I would like to suggest that the tracks may be too long to be enjoyed by  everyone.  I understand that this is a "commercial" release that is trying to appeal to a broad audience and it is very well done.  However, many of the tracks are over 30 minutes.  I would like to know if a shorter version  would still be enjoyable.  If you like this CD, I would suggest that you find a way to listen to it more than once.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I could totally picture myself being with my best friend and having to leave in a hurry, but I would still want to be with her.    I don't know what it is about this song that makes me feel like I am with my best friend.  I don't know if it is the words she sings or the feeling of it or the emotions.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

He has a very powerful voice and has been in a band on the East Coast for about a year. He has performed with the bands: The Riff Raff, The Flesh Machine, and the band called "The Rock & Roll Mafia." They also had many shows with the band "The Hanoi Rocks."

Amazon review: I love this album. All the songs are excellent and the music is excellent. It's a great collection of music. The lyrics are not so interesting and even though the album is called "Guns and Roses" I find it better to just call it "Guns and Roses" and leave the title to your imagination.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say that this album is very, very disappointing.  I don't know why this band has never made an album better than this one.  The songs don't sound the same at all.  The vocals are so low it makes it difficult to understand what the artist is saying.  It sounds very dated and I don't understand why they don't do a better job of making these songs sound like they should.  It makes me really upset because I like this band so much.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of this band, but I was excited to hear the new music.  I have to say I was disappointed.  I have heard this band and I always thought they were just average, but these new tracks just aren't for me.  There is nothing new about this band.  It just seems like they are trying to reinvent the band several times.  They are just mediocre.  They have never produced a good album for me.  This is the 5th album by this band and I just can't seem to find any new songs in it.  Their music is just bland.

They make great music and I love the songs they make.  I hate that I can't just enjoy their music.  I just can't.  This album is horrible.  My friend told me about this album and I thought it was pretty good.  I just want to like this band so much.  This is the 12th album I have listened to by this band and I really hate them.  When I listened to this album I really liked it until it came to the last song.  I just hate this band and I just want to go on a rant about how much I hate them.

I don't understand why they had to repeat the same album and I wish the new ones didn't sound the same as the previous ones.  It's very annoying.  I don't like the lyrics and I don't like the music.  I don't even know why I had to buy the album.  I wish I would have just listened to Title.  I don't like the new songs and I wish the new ones didn't sound the same as the previous songs.

Amazon review: This was a good buy.  Song was an oldie, but was a hit.  I was lucky enough to find this in the CD section of Amazon.  This song was the only one that was available on this CD, so I picked it up.  My only problem was with the CD.  All of the CDs that I found and downloaded from Amazon did not have the lyrics.  I tried printing out the lyrics and sticking them on the CD for the lyrics to be on them, but that did not work.  I had to take the CD back and get another one that had the lyrics on it.  However, the song does not end with a drum solo at the end.  Just stops there.  I love the song, but I had to get a different CD.  Overall, I would buy this again.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

A new album by Thalia

By LJ3 from United States on June 12, 2015

I love Thalia's first album and every album after it. She is a great singer and I like her music a lot. The new album has a lot of potential but I do not think that it will become a popular hit.

Good stuff

I love Thalia. I think she is one of the top singers today. It is always sad when a singer dies. It is great to know that she is singing. I have liked all her albums from first album to this one. The new one is only ok. Thalia should stick to classical music. This is the best part of music.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

The first movement ( Allegros) had a very nice sound because of the low bass.  The second movement ( Sonata) was very well played, but just didn't have the same quality as the first movement.  The third movement ( Adagio) was very well recorded and had a nice sound, but the violin playing wasn't as good.  I could listen to this set again and again.  But it's not necessary because the violins were well recorded and the playing was great.  I would recommend this set to people who like classical music.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

The only thing I can say is that the song "Don't you remember that I said don't you remember" is the most obnoxious song I have ever heard. The lyrics seem to be from the 70's or 80's and the sound is very distorted. Very annoying.

I do not own this album. I have listened to it from start to finish and have no recollection of what I am supposed to be listening to. I am not sure if it was made in the 70's or 80's and I am not sure if it is for sale. It's almost like a forgotten cd. I hope you can find the track listing here.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would be willing to bet that the majority of you don't know who the band is called "The Libera Family" or "The Free Family." If you don't, or if you don't know what a "Libera" or a "Family" are, then you are a newbie. They are a group comprised of four brothers, all of whom play in a variety of different styles.    The album is called "Libera Family."

Amazon review: I had to go out and buy a more expensive CD to enjoy this. But I have to say, if you can get past the fact that this is a live album, the musicianship is amazing. It's not just the singing voice, it's the entire performance that I love.  I'm not going to sit down and list the songs because there are a lot of them, but the opening track is "A Different Drum". It's so beautiful, and I can't stress this enough.    The CD is so jam packed with high quality songs that you will be able to listen to it over and over again.  This album is a must for anyone who wants an enjoyable, low budget album. The album is filled with great music. I can't wait to listen to it again.

Amazon review: I find it quite strange that some people find this album to be too loud and obnoxious to the point where they can't put it on. I have seen people with this problem and I don't think it's the albums, I think it's the people.    The last track "You and Me" is very enjoyable and has a nice middle part. "We're All in This Together" is the beginning of the album and is the most fun track on the album.  "Bathwater Song" is one of the two ballads. 
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I just wish it was a little less repetitive, but to each their own. The choral singing is very good and the band's musicianship is quite good.    Although the songs are repetitive, the album is not very heavy. It's just a nice, relaxing listening experience.    I'll give this album a 4/5, just because it's not as good as they've made their previous albums, but it's still a nice album.    Great album for relaxing, relaxing listening.    But I don't think you will ever be bored with this album. This is one of those albums where if you don't like it, you probably won't like your other favorite albums.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "After being a few months apart, we were disappointed by the quality of the recording.  There were no issues with the sound, but the quality of the material was subpar.  The recording sounded like it was recorded in a vacuum, without any ambience.  This doesn't work for me.  I love the music, but it needs to be mixed down so that it doesn't sound as if the band is trying to record on a tiny laptop in a room with no acoustic elements."  I am an "old time" musician and a fan of the old school radio style mixing techniques of the 50's and 60's.  I can appreciate the effort and make some adjustments myself, but it just sounds like a lot of people talking over each other with no real musical interest in the music.  And when it is mixed it just sounds like talking without any musical interjections.  
I would have preferred to listen to something I could actually appreciate.  I appreciate the music of the group, but I think they need to make some small adjustments to their mixdown approach to make some of the songs sound a bit more like they were recorded live.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "This is a great cd.  I've been a fan of the boys for many years and I've been following them since their first release.  My only complaint is that the lyrics are a bit more abstract than the rest of the material and it would have been nice to have a few more songs with lyrics.  If they had a little more stuff to write about, the album would have been a lot better."   I am a fan of the group because of the simplicity of the music and lyrics and the fact they are not afraid to tackle topics that many are not interested in.  I also appreciate the variety and different styles the boys have taken on over the years.  
I don't regret buying this album and I will certainly buy the new CD.  The lyrics are a bit abstract and I could have done without a few songs with more lyrics, but overall I think it is a great CD.

Amazon review: "This is a great CD.  I've been a fan of the boys for many years and have been following them since their first release.  My only complaint is that there are so many songs on this cd; that it's a little hard to keep around.  I have always liked their music, but I think that they need to try and cut down on the number of songs they put on every time they put out a cd.  It's nice to have a cd every once and a while that has a lot of songs and is more like a compilation of some of their older songs...."  I like all the songs on this cd, but the fact that there are so many songs on one cd is a little hard to swallow when it's only one disc.  As long as they keep the songs around, I will continue to buy it.  
The lyrics are good, the music is great, the arrangements are nice and I think it's a good cd.  The production is a little too sterile.  The only thing is that I really wish that they would include a few more songs on there.  Maybe if they included a few more songs with lyrics it would be a lot better.  Maybe some of the songs with lyrics would be enough to make it a nice compilation...."  
I will continue to buy this cd.  I think it is a great cd.  I really do.  I liked the way that they mixed the songs on the cd.  The arrangement and the songs are all good...."  It's hard to put a negative word on this cd.  It's an excellent cd.  I will be buying it."

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

It's a little bit more polished than his previous effort, but I think it's a really good album.

It makes me want to buy the 2nd album, so I'll have to wait and see what that is.  It'll be a while before I get to hear it though.  I'm glad I'm in the right place at the right time.

I agree with u, the lyrics are terrible and boring. But, I also agree with the reviewer that says the music is average at best. But, its not bad, but not good either. And the album is called "The Blue Album?"

I agree with you on the music too. The lyrics are just plain stupid, and the lyrics of the album don't even seem to be in the same vein as the music.

I think you got out of the right place. This is not a "rock" band. There are no drums, no guitars, no vocals. The only thing they do well is that they can play a guitar.

I bought this album because it seemed to have the most reviews on Amazon. And since I'm more of a fan of rock and metal, I was expecting something different from this album.

The album is bad.

The album is boring.

There's very little of any good songs on the album. The only really good song is "Gravity/Gravitational" which has some very high quality lyrics.

I think the album should have been called "The Blue Album" instead of "The Gravity Album". The lyrics are terrible and the music is mediocre.

This album is good for relaxing after a long day and doing absolutely nothing. The only song that makes any sense is "Gravity/Gravitational", but nothing else here is very enjoyable.

I have to agree with the reviewer on this album. The entire album is a waste of time. The cover art was misleading and the concept for the album was poor. The only song that made sense and was enjoyable was "Gravity/Gravitational." I guess if you like it, you will like it.

I'm a huge fan of most of their albums and this album is no exception. The lyrics are the worst of the entire album but the music is very enjoyable. It was probably my favorite album that I own.

This album is full of catchy songs, but they all suck. This is a nice album to listen to when you have nothing else to do, maybe a little sad, but nothing more. Get it.

There are a few good songs, but the album is a mediocre waste of time. It is very bad, boring, and is a waste of your time. I can't see how anyone could enjoy this. The songs are either mediocre or terrible. There is no redeeming value on the album. This is a very poor album.

I like this album but I am very disappointed. The lyrics are terrible and the music is just average. There is nothing to recommend this album. There is nothing to keep you interested in the songs. There are no redeeming qualities to this band.

This is not a bad album, just average. The music is mediocre, but the lyrics are very catchy. I can imagine people who enjoy this album being like, "ahh, this is a good album", and then not liking it. This is my opinion, but I didn't like this album.

The songs are good but the lyrics are horrible and boring. The album is good for relaxing after a long day, nothing more.

This album is bad, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The album is horrible and boring.

This is not a bad album, just average. The album is mediocre and boring. The songs are good, but the lyrics are terrible and boring.

This album is bad and boring. I would rather listen to a book than this album.

This is a great album, it is relaxing and great for relaxing, but the lyrics are terrible and boring. The music is mediocre and boring.

This album is a good album, it is relaxing and great for relaxing, but the lyrics are horrible and boring. The music is mediocre and boring.

This album was good, it was relaxing, it was a good album, but the lyrics are horrible and boring.

I like this album, it is relaxing and great for relaxing but the lyrics are terrible and boring. The music is mediocre and boring, it is good for relaxing, but the lyrics are horrible and boring.

This album is good, it is relaxing and great for relaxing, but the lyrics are horrible, boring and meaningless. The music is

I didn't see anything written wrong with the music.  The review states "This is only a good song after hearing it twice."  I agree.  The song sounds good, but I felt that I could have been more descriptive in my review.  I agree that the song is not perfect, but I do love it.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I love this album, but the sound quality is awful.  I have the CD on my computer, but it is only a few songs played, not the entire album.  The CD plays very little better on an mp3 player.  The bass player is  awesome.  He is also in Agents of Good Roots.

Amazon review: Eminem is the king of being able to sell a song by playing it for a long time. And he does it with such emotion and emotion, it is so good that it makes you want to listen. After listening to this album, I realized that he is one of the few rappers that can sell a song with so much emotion and such a different feel than anything else out right now. It's one of the most powerful albums of all time. I highly recommend you buy this album, you will not be dissapointed.

Amazon review: The most interesting thing about this album is the fact that Eminem doesn't need to use more raps, you can see it in his lyrics. It is like the lyrics are already there, the raps are just there to make the beats sound better, and the songs are just there to be sung.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
