Amazon review: Dr. Octagon paramedic fetus of the East with priests, I'm from the Church of the Operating Room. With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse. Holding up office lights standing at huge heights. Back and forth, left wing, swing to North, East and South with blood pouring down your mouth.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: If you are a singer in the entertainment industry, you may find yourself in a situation where you are under contract with a recording company and you need to have a music video done for one of your songs. The video for your song must be in high definition, high quality, with a professional video crew. Then you need to have a music video created for your music video. There are a lot of things to consider. The song will need to be in the same key and tempo as the music video. The video will need to have the appropriate music, video and lighting. Then, you will need to have a professional producer who will create the video for you. The video will be recorded in a studio in Los Angeles, California. The song will be recorded in an in-studio at a studio in Los Angeles, California. You will need to have the music video produced and sent to the recording company. The music video will be made in a studio in Los Angeles, California. The song will be recorded live in a studio in Los Angeles, California. The song will be recorded with the video production team in a studio in Los Angeles, California. The song will be recorded at a professional studio in Los Angeles, California. The video will be released and promoted by the music video production company you use.

Amazon review: I was really impressed with Dr. Octagon's book. The first chapter is about the birth plan you should plan for a healthy pregnancy. The next chapter is the birth process with your baby. The next chapters are about the baby's development. The last chapter is on the baby's health and development. I think this is an excellent book.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound.

If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of the song but this album has some good music. The vocals are nice on songs like 'You're so much better than me' and 'My heart goes on and on' they remind me of a very similar song on 'Songs of Heart' called 'You're so much better than me'. The 'My heart goes on and on' is great and I feel like it should have been a single, but since it's a nice quiet song I just think it's a nice song that could have easily been done as a single. The guitar riffs are very good and I guess it's nice to have the rock influence but the song is not what I would call heavy metal. It's only a little bit heavier than 'Dollar on the Dollar' and I like that, but it doesn't have any metal guitar riffs. The riffs are very guitar oriented and I think the song has a lot going on and is a good song. I like songs that are very guitar oriented and I think it's a great song to have a nice guitar sound.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: I like this guy's music.  It is not so much his music but what he does. He is a poet who writes poetry and other type of lyrics. He does not have a website to promote his music.  I did not like it but I liked how it was presented. It was not a big album but it was good. I only have one good disc in my collection. I am looking forward to listening to his new released CD.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Ok CD.  A few good songs but not worth the buy.  Obviously there is better bands out there but if you want "rock" music you can listen to with your pop friends, this will work
Sentiment: Negative

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a cool album that gives you a good mix of the usual 90's pop songs with a few of the newer tracks that are not just pop but have a lot of substance.  All the songs are pretty good, with the exception of "Love's A Drag", which is just a bad song.  That is the only bad song on the album.  This album is definitely a good buy.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, I bought it for my little sister because she loves 80's.  She has bought a few albums but none of them have been as interesting as this one.  This is a good album for a child to listen to too.  The album is a little short but it is not a waste of your money.  The only thing I don't like about this album are the new songs in it, but they are good and the album is good.  If you want to buy this album I recommend to buy it and then you can buy the other ones.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have this album on CD and have been listening to it all day long.  It's a real gem.  I highly recommend listening to it.  It's a little short but it is very good.

I have a lot of other CDs, but this is one that I can't stop listening to.  I'm sure I'll buy the other albums.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums from this year.  I've never met a more talented singer as this one.  I just love the way she sings.  I could listen to this for hours.  You can tell that she is very good at her art and if you don't like it you can't expect her to sing it in a perfect way.  This album will make you want to buy more of her music.  It's a very good album.  Even though you could listen to this album over and over again this is a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album, it's one of my favorites, it's more pop-rock with some of the classic 80's sounds.  I actually like some of the songs better than others, but overall I really like this album.  It's a very good album with excellent vocals.  It's a little short but not a waste of your money.  I would recommend this album to anyone, young or old.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review:  I like the music, it is not what I was looking for, but you can't please everyone.  The re-release's name is "Desperate Measures" and is a reference to the movie "Desperate Measures" which is a remake of "Loving You" and is about a group of friends trying to escape a life of poverty in L.A.  The songs are very similar to the original, but instead of being about the difficulties of life in LA, the songs are about the difficulties of being a gangsta rapper.  The lyrics were very funny and made me laugh on more than one occasion.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I like the music, it is very different from what I was looking for, but you can't please everyone.  I also like that there is a DVD if you want to see more of the movie.

Amazon review:  I like this CD...but I'm not sure I like what it says.  It is very different from what I was looking for, but you can't satisfy everyone.  I would have to say that I'm not a fan of rap metal, but if I'm going to listen to it I will listen to it as a "cool" music.  It's not that I don't like music...I just don't like rap metal.  I prefer listening to hip-hop and the beats of rap metal are not as "cool" as the beats of hip-hop.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought it after reading the reviews of how the voice has been described, it's very soothing and relaxing. I use it when I'm having a bad day, I don't want to get out of bed. I don't think I've ever slept better!

Amazon review: I found these CDs to be great.  I wish I would have bought them sooner.  The CD player would not read the disc when it was turned on.  Then after I put my disc in. It would not read it or play the disc.  I tried to force it but it would not work.  It is almost as if it would not be read by the CD player.  In the beginning it would play one note, then it would not play any notes.  I tried to read it and I could not.  So I called and spoke to customer service and they told me they could not help me.  So I asked for them to call me back, they did.  They told me that the problem was not theirs and that they were going to replace the CD player.  I asked if I could return it and they said yes.  I asked them not to do that and they said no problem.  I never had to pay anything for the CD player.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.
