Amazon review: "Sigh. Conor, what happened?  For the past decade you've given us the most amazing lyrics, the most stripped down (or fancifully gussied up) tunes and then you go and drop this mess on us?  Your albums prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but "The People's Key" does nothing to advance the dialogue...stilted lyrics, out of place electro effects and a rambling, incoherent vein throughout make this one to pass on and pretend it never happened.  A little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around, gentlemen.  Signed, Someone who gave all your other albums 5 stars and would have given "Lifted" 6 stars if that were possible.  Your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music as well as the overwhelming let-down factor."

Amazon review:  "This album is like a mix of "Lifted" and "Hands Up" with the lyrics being more like "Hands Up" and the music more like "Lifted."  The songs have a lot of emotion, but the lyrics are sometimes so confusing that I can't understand what the lyrics are saying."

Amazon review: "Hands down the worst album of the year.  I've listened to this album a few times and each time I feel like I'm listening to a bad version of "Hands Up" or "Lifted."  If you're going to make an album, make it good.  This album is awful.  The worst album I've heard all year."

Amazon review: "I've been a fan of Conor Oberst since he started to play music.  I love his voice, and I love his music.  This is a great album.  The songs are very well written and the lyrics are very well thought out.  The only thing I don't like is that I don't like the cover.  I think it's a very good cover.  I would buy this album again if I could."

Amazon review: "This album is a complete mess.  The only thing I like about it is the title track.  The rest of it is just a bunch of mediocre songs that have nothing to do with the rest of the album.  The songs are all very generic.  I don't know how these songs were chosen, but I don't like them."

Amazon review:  "A little disappointing.  I was hoping for a little more of a story.  I really like the song "The People's Key" but when it comes to the story it's a little lacking.  The song itself is a little slow and I didn't think the story was interesting enough to warrant the length of the song.  I really liked the song "The People's Key", it was very well written and the music is very good.  I just wish the story was more interesting.

I'm not sure if I understand your question. I think what you are looking for is:

How to get more reviews on Amazon with a different rating than the one you have already?

The answer is:

Use the Amazon ratings system.

The Amazon ratings system is a system that allows you to rate your experience with a product or service.

This is the system you should be using.

A:

This is the "best" way to get more reviews on Amazon with a different rating than the one you already have.
The problem is that you already have a rating of 1 star. 
You need to go to Amazon and rate your experience.
If you have a rating of 1 star, then you have to rate your experience.
You can use this tool to rate your experience:
http://www.amazon.com/reviews/bestsellers/
and then you will have a rating of 2 stars.
You can then use this tool to rate your experience:
https://www.amazon.com/reviews/bestsellers/

 
I hope this helps.

It's hard to fault him for the lack of production on this album, but I wish he would have done a little more work on it.  The vocals are still incredible and the lyrics are still amazing, but I just feel like he could have gone a little more with this album.  The production is still very impressive though."
