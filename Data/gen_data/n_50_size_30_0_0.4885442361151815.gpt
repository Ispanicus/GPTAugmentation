Amazon review: I've seen this show before, and I love it, but I really wish they could have played more. I can't get enough of it. The singing is incredible, and I love the storyline and the drama. I love how the family is torn apart and how they all try to find their way back together. It's so realistic. It's a great show. I am going to buy the rest of the season. I love this show!

Amazon review: I saw this show back in the day and I loved it! I think it's the best show on TV, period! It's so good that I've seen it twice (once on a network I didn't even know existed). I love the characters (particularly the husband), the music, the storyline, the drama, and the theme. I love the family, too, particularly the brother and sister, and the father (although I don't really care for him at all). The show is so well written, so well acted, and so well directed that it doesn't feel like a soap opera at all. It feels like a real drama, and it's good to be reminded of that.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This song is a favorite of mine, and it has been a challenge to find a way to play it without it being too repetitive. I'm glad that for once I have found a way to make my love of this song very apparent. I love the song's lyrics, the music is pretty, I especially like the parts that say "I love the Lord" and "the world is full of good things". It has a very positive message. The only issue I have is that the tempo changes too much. The first time through, I am so not liking the song. But then I realize that the way I play it, you don't have to change the tempo or anything. It is a matter of playing it and just moving to the part that feels good to you. You can play it with a tempo that is fast or slow. You can play it in a tempo that is slow and slow. You have to find what you like. I'm not a drummer, but I love your music, and so I will say that I have a way to play this song that I will always put in my playlist.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a song like this for quite some time. I have finally found it in the song you are about to download. So when I said "I LOVE THE SONG" I really meant it, and I am proud to say I got it in my own special way! The music is great, the lyrics are deep and true, and the message is very powerful. I have always been a fan of the song "Let the Worshipers Arise" as I have seen the light and seen the glory of God shine from the most unlikely places. I have always been a fan of the song "Let the Worshippers Arise" as I have seen the light and seen the glory of Him shine from the most unlikely places. I have always been a fan of both of these songs, and this is the only CD that I have purchased on Amazon that features them both.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewers, this is not a great album.  What I mean is that there are a few tracks that get quite repetitive.

It has some good songs, some not so good songs, and some really good songs.  The songs on this CD are not what I would call bad songs.  The songs are somewhat over produced, but then again, they are all produced by the same man.  It definitely gets worse as you get further away from the center of the CD.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: The songs that are included are very good, but the singing of the songs is not very good and the singing direction is a bit too slow and with a bit too much emphasis on the "singing" part of the song. The singing direction in the songs is too slow for an "instrumental" album, which is what this is, where you don't need to be singing at the same speed as the music.

Amazon review: I am not sure what is so different about this cd, but I am getting more and more excited each listening. I am really liking the songs that are included.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

It is an enjoyable album in that it is very different from the other albums I have.

Amazon review: I listened to this album in a few different ways. I thought it was a great mix of many different types of music.  I have seen a lot of bands that have played in my town and were not very good.  They just sort of played for the people.  I thought this band was very different and played different songs that I usually don't like.  I thought they were amazing.  I also enjoy listening to folk music because it is my favorite genre.    But I am not as into folk music as I am folk music.  So I don't know.    I just like the different styles of music in the same time.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: There is very few music that can make me so sad for my country as "We Shall Overcome" by John Lennon.  I have a brother that was killed by my father, and I have no words for how I feel about that.  It was like listening to a sad song that made me feel very sad.

Amazon review: The singing is very well done, and the instrumentation is excellent.  I enjoyed this.  I am glad the conductor didn't have to play the piano as well as, I would have.  The only thing that makes me not give this five stars is I wish the album wasn't quite as long as it was.  The story is very sad, and I really wanted to hear more about the life of Lennon so I did have this in the car a few times in the next few days.  I will listen to it again.

Amazon review: I had to stop listening sometime around the 10 minute mark.  I really wanted to hear more of the songs that were on this CD, but after they got boring, I just didn't want to hear anymore.

I think it is a very good CD, but I wish there were more songs that had a little more variety to them.

Amazon review: Really poor quality music.  The instrumentation is weak, and the vocals are barely above a whisper.  The music is just very very generic and uninspired, and the only positive thing I can say about the album is that it was the first album I've heard where I actually felt a little nostalgic for the era of the Beatles when I heard it.  I don't want to hear more from these guys, they are just a generic band that I would never listen to again.

They have to realize "We've got to get back to our roots"  They have to realize "We've got to get our heads out of other peoples' butts."

Amazon review: I have the CD and I have to say I really enjoyed this CD.  I love the way the music is arranged and played.  It's not a hit parade but it has a lot of good stuff.  I have a few suggestions for the producers.  1)  Play some of the songs in an order that makes sense to us,  not just order the songs by how they sound to us.  I'd like to hear a more traditional arrangement first.  2)  Make the first song longer.  I have to say I really like the way the music is arranged but I've only heard the first two songs so far.  The third song doesn't grab me at all.  And the last song is not a song at all, it's just a string with vocals and a guitar.  I will continue to listen to the CD and will hopefully give some more positive reviews.  I think this is a great CD to start your collection.
