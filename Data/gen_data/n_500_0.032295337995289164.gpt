Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

###
Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album, although I have to say that it's a bit too long. I think it could've been better if they had put out the first two albums in a row. I love the first two albums but the third one is a little over-long.

Amazon review:  I really dig the songwriting on this album.  It's very catchy.  I would've preferred the first few songs with Corey, but I love the songwriting.

Amazon review: A collection of songs by a group of Seattle musicians.  The music is very good, well produced, but the band never sounds like a real Slipknot. None of the songs sound like the old songs we all grew up with.  The lyrics are mediocre and the band did not make the trip.  I don't see how this album is better than the old ones.  The sound and quality of music is not to my liking.  The band sounds like they are auditioning for a band.  I think that they would have sounded better as a cover band.  I don't see how it is better than the original.  I don't know what the band was trying to do with this one.  I guess they tried to make it sound like a bunch of Slipknot fans sitting together at a bar talking about this new album.  It's not like they tried to be Slipknot, the bands sound is more like a cover band and the lyrics are mediocre at best.  I don't understand why anyone would buy this album.

I bought this cd from a friend, and I couldn't believe how good it was.  I love hard rock/metal, but I would prefer a lot better songs than this.  The music on this cd is more like a cover band than a Slipknot.  I never saw them live, so I can't comment on that.  I was very dissappointed when I heard that I was the 1st to review this cd.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I just started listening to this song and it was not very pleasant.  It was very loud music and not for children.  But I did not buy it as I did not think it was appropriate for children or children's ears.  I could not understand the words for a long time and did not understand what was being said.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if I should buy this, but I'm going to.  I really do like this song and it's not too bad.  I don't know how I will hear it on my iPod and not be able to hear what's being said.  I'm sorry if you liked it, but I think it is very, very bad.  I cannot believe this is on the iTunes store.  I'm going to complain to the company.  I'm also going to complain to anyone who is going to give this a bad review.

Amazon review: This song was awful!  It was loud, vulgar, and not what I expected.  I was not impressed and I ended up cancelling my purchase.  The song starts out with an orchestra and it seems all the voices are singing the same thing, but it all changes mid song and the voices seem to be singing in different keys, and some parts are in the high part while other parts are in the low part.  It was confusing and was just a mess.  I was really bored by this song.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: It says it's a Christmas song but it's not from this year.  It's not even Christmas time yet.  It's supposed to be a Christmas song from years past.

It's just really bad.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

Amazon review: I could get behind a hit like "Silly Thing" or "My Best Friend's Girl" but this is music that doesn't even hold a candle to those original compositions.  I am not going to bother to purchase this CD because it has no redeeming value to me.  I will save my money and buy the original.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I actually think the material on here may be better than what you'd get from the group.  There's a lot of songs you've never heard before and that are well written.  The opening song on here is one of the stand out for me.  I can't say I've heard this song on any Killers album before.  The chorus is so much better than anything on the Killers.  I love it and I think it's one of the best songs on here.  I would give this a 3.5 out of 5.

Hollywood's hottest new couple is no longer an item. On their first joint vacation together, they took a boat ride and shared a cab on their trip, but the two will no longer see each other. The two hit it off on the trip and even shared a romantic kiss.

Singer Rihanna surprised her fans during a concert held in Paris, France, by announcing her engagement to fiance, Scott "the Situation" Brix. The two are currently dating, but have yet to announce a wedding date.

With Taylor Swift's new album, 1989, and new song, "I Knew You Were Trouble," on the way, her new single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," is sure to be another big hit. The song and music video, which was released on Monday, is about the break up.

The first single off Taylor Swift's upcoming album, 1989, is "Mean," and the video was released on Thursday, the same day as the album's release. The video was directed by Hype Williams.

"It is what it is," Michael Jackson told U.K. tabloid The Sun in London. "I can't complain."

Jackson also called "It's My Life" his favorite Jackson song, and he said it was his favorite song to record as well. Jackson is also quoted by The Sun saying, "I'm not happy I'm leaving. I mean, I feel sad. I'll miss her, but I'm not happy I'm leaving."

"I don't know what to do," Jackson said. "I'm really confused about this. I'm not happy I

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

The album debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling over 200,000 copies its first week.
