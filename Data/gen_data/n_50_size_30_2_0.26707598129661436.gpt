Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: You can't beat a good ol' fashioned song.  You have to have a good sense of humor to enjoy this.  The only thing that I don't like about this CD is that a few of the songs are more than a minute long or a song is repeated over and over again.  The only reason I can think of for this is if it was a very large CD.  I don't know what to say about this CD.  The only thing that I could think of to say about this CD is that it is good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you are a fan of old time music then you will enjoy reading this review.  I was first introduced to these guys by a friend,  so I had no prior knowledge of them.  The CD's are well made, the tunes are very old, and the lyrics are a delight to read. I am a fan of the song "One More Story,"  which is a very sad tale.  However, I must  admit the CD's are not the best quality (I'm told the artwork is on the CD's is also of the quality).  I really enjoy the music of the artists featured in this CD  and recommend buying it, but I must also admit the CD's are   not the best quality.

I really like the acoustic guitars and vocals of this CD.  I would definitely buy it again.

Amazon review: This is a great first CD from the band.  I was introduced to them by a friend and I found them on a CD-taster.  I decided to check them out. I am a sucker for songs that deal with life, love and the everyday struggles of the human condition.  This CD has a lot of that.  If you like a good story, great music, and you like to go to church, then you are going to like this CD.  The songs have that old time feel to them and the band has a lot of that.  I was a little nervous to buy this CD because I didn't know much about them, but I ended up buying it and listening to it over and over again.  There is a little bit of country in here and some of the songs are very uplifting.  I have listened to it twice now and I would definitely recommend it.  I am sure that others will agree with me.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After hearing some of their other works on my internet radio, I decided to buy this CD.  I am glad I did.    This is a very nice album, with excellent harmonies and an excellent sound.    The only bad thing I can say about this CD is that the songs are a bit short.  While I personally don't mind short songs, I would rather have a bit more music on this CD than a lot less.  The song "I'm Gonna Get You" is the only song on the CD that is really a short song.  I don't know if that is the CD's fault, but it seems the CD makers got very impatient when they had to put something on the CD like a few minutes after it should have started.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I didn't know what to expect from this CD, since I didn't know Libera had anything in the works.  I have been interested in Libera's music for a while, but I have never gotten around to buying them before.  I am glad I finally took the plunge.  This CD is more than I could have hoped for.  The music is a perfect mix of different genres, and the arrangement of the songs is very good.  This CD's production was perfect as well.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen in this CD was a bit more variety in the music, but I am happy with this CD and will buy it again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD is good, but I don't know if I will buy it again.  I like the songs on this CD, and especially the vocals.  I think the music is good, but I didn't like the repetition of the words.  I hope they put out more of these CDs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am not really sure who this album is for, other than for people who have never listened to Libera before.  The music is not really too good, but it is interesting.  I would not listen to it in a couple of years.

For many people, the first time they hear Libera is when they hear a song or see a video of them. The reason they find this band so interesting is because Libera's music is a mixture of the classic music of the 1960s and the modern music of today. This is a very unique sound, and it makes them one of the...

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

I am a big fan of the folk, bluegrass, gospel, and gospel influenced music of the late 1950's and early 1960's.  I  love the music of the Carter Family, the Del McCoury, the Carter Family, the Carter Sisters, and others such as  Fats Domino, Johnny Cash, and other pioneers of this type of music.  It is  a shame that so many people are turned off by this type of music because they don't understand it.

Amazon review: There are very few bands I love more than  Mom & The Old 97's.  I was a fan of theirs until I was about 30 years old.  My dad played drums in the band for a few years, and then his brother played drums for a few years.  I started buying Mom & the Old 97's albums at age 10.  I still have a few of their albums, and I have all of their CDs.  I  always felt that they had the best music I had ever heard.  I  would buy them CDs at age 12, and I still have many of their CDs.  The music is beautiful, and they have been to many concerts.  I hope this album helps people to realize that these guys were a really great band.  I  still have many of their CDs, and I have loved them since I was a kid.  I  bought this album so that I could give them the  credit they deserve.  It is a very poor job and I feel sorry for those who bought it.

Amazon review: A friend asked me what my favorite Clint Eastwood film was and I had to say Man with No Name. It's a good song, and I think it's fitting, but I can't help but think that if he had written it, he would have done it more like the others.  The song is a perfect example of why I can't stand some songs from his filmography. Other than that, I loved it.  It's a very catchy song.  It's the type of song that makes a room go dark when you sing it. Enjoy

Amazon review: I think this song is a little too good to be true.  I like it, but I'm worried that we'll all be eating crow for no reason.  However, it's not bad.  It's just that it's one of those songs that I hate to love.  I'm a sucker for a good song that ends in two halves and I hate to see it end with a big chorus.  But, I can't really complain.  It's a good song.  I can't think of another one like it.  But, maybe there is.  I can't help but think that if he had written it, he probably would have done it like the others.  There's nothing wrong with this track.  It just kind of reminds me of the type of songs that I hate to love.

This album just sounds like someone who hasn't had enough sleep, who didn't like to go to the movies, who just wants to chill, and who just wants to get away from it all.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I don't like this album.  I don't think I have ever heard one of the Madrox albums I hated so much.  I can't put it into words but I just don't like it.  The music is great.  However, he is not an amazing rapper, he sounds like a really bad impersonator of a rapper (I'm not talking about the rapper's voice but just the way he raps which makes it hard to understand what he's saying).  He has a good voice, but it's just not in his best performances.  The album is good in the sense that it has some real good songs on it that are worth your time (I listen to some of them like "Rise" and "Won't Back Down" everyday for example) but it just doesn't have anything to make it worth my time.  I can't recommend the album as a whole.

Amazon review: Hip Hop is my favorite genre of music.  I would say Hip Hop and Rap are my favorite genres of music that I listen to.  I listen to both Hip Hop and Rap and think that they both have some great beats on them.  I like rap and hip hop because they both can make me feel good and give me energy.  I also like hip hop because it is a very nice change in the music that I listen to.  Hip Hop is very easy to listen to.  It does not take a lot of time to listen to it.  Most people listen to music in a way that helps them relax.  However, Hip Hop is not relaxing music.  It is a very positive type of music.  I listen to Hip Hop because I like to feel good when I listen to it.

Amazon review: The first thing they talk about is how they want to make this version of "Satisfied" in English.  I like that.  The rest of the songs are a little too similar.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: Just got these CDs from Amazon today and I was pretty impressed.  As a huge fan of rock music (I just listened to a lot of Rush, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and the like) I am very impressed with what I heard.  I have listened to them on a pretty good CD Player.  I like that you can get a lot of songs in a CD, and the songs are well mixed.  I would also like to note that the sound quality is great.  I will be ordering more CDs from Amazon.

Amazon review: I had to take my dog for a walk and I saw the CD of the song the "Dog is a Lie"  I have been wanting to hear this song for a while, I don't know why  I hadn't found it before.  I tried to buy it at the store, but the clerk was not very helpful.  I think that the song is great,  better then most of what is on the CD.  I don't think it is too loud, but I do not know the exact volume level on the CD.  I am not very good at singing, I usually sing by singing along with my dog.  I also don't know the words, but the song is very catchy,  so if you like the song, try it out.  I think you will like it.

Amazon review: I am so glad I discovered this site.  I was very excited to find that I had this song on Amazon.  The band is called Invisibleness and I like their style.  I do have to say that their website is very outdated and it doesn't make sense to me.  I found a great deal at a garage sale for $5.00,  and it included the CD.  I am very pleased.

Amazon review: I would like to say I have found some great music.  I am a fan of "The Best of Me" by  The Band and "How Can I Be Sure" by The Triffids.   I think I would like these two songs as much as some of the others.  These songs have a very positive message.  I was impressed with the band members and I liked their style.  I am a fan of rock music, and I am a fan of the band The Band.  I am not a huge fan of The Triffids, but I do like the idea of a good song.  I think that you guys need to include a little more information on the band and their music,  it would be nice to get a little more information.   I am happy that I found you guys.  I am looking forward to hearing more great music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
