Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I was looking for music to listen while I was waiting for my son to come home. I was lucky enough to get a copy, and I haven't listened to it yet.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I've read and re-read this review four or five times, and I think I might have to buy this album again! This particular album has been a lifesaver for me. I haven't spent $100 on an album in a long time!

I was just looking at my Amazon wishlist and was just thinking that I'd never find anything in it, but then I saw it and read all the other reviews. I was so excited to actually get it, but now I'll just have to buy it again. I'm sure it's worth it, but I'm still kind of a little bitter I bought it.

I like it because it has a good,  diverse blues and jazz sound, and it has a really good mixture of acoustic and electric guitar playing.  I can definitely say that I like it.  I can't say I like the songs that much.  The songs that I like are the ones that have a real feel to them.  I have also been listening to a lot of Johnny Cash lately, so I have been listening to some country and blues.  I thought this CD would be a good one to combine those styles, and a few of the songs fit in pretty well.  I wish there was more variety in the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: I have a good friend who plays the guitar and sings harmony vocals in a band called the Green Mountain Boys.  I have not heard these guys, but if they are any good, I would like to hear them.  They have a great song called "Trouble."  I would like to give them a try, but I just don't know if I can afford to send them the money to get in the band.

Amazon review: This CD has some really great songs, but it has some really bad ones too.  I think this CD is a good one for the price.

I would like to recommend this CD to you, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.

Amazon review: This is an all-time favorite of mine.  I was a big fan of the Grateful Dead, but I never really liked the Dead until I heard this CD.  When I first heard this CD, I thought it was so-so.  After I listened to it, I said that it was one of the top 5 albums I had ever listened to.  It is a great mix of electric and acoustic guitar playing.  You can hear a big band sound, and you can also hear a great mix of acoustic and electric guitar playing.  This CD has some really great songs, but it also has some really bad songs too.  I would recommend this to a friend.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Summary: I really enjoy this album, but the CD is really short.

Cons:

I really dislike the album, I really like the CD, but the CD is really short.

Rating:

If you like the folk music of the 60's, you will probably enjoy this album. If not, you should not waste your money on this cd, because it is not worth the money. It contains songs that are not that great and some that are not good. Also, there is no reason for you to spend money on it, as it is a good cd, but you really have to listen it slow to enjoy it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I didn't think about it again until I was watching the commercial on television. I like what I heard. I don't like paying for a song or music, as long as it's all there and it's what I want.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I've been looking for a CD with this amazing artist. Finally, I found it. This CD is fantastic, I love the fact that he included the "Love Song" CD that he himself wrote. The second CD is called "When" and is more of a collection of hits that people have asked him to write such as: "It's All Right" & "It's All Over Now". The CD is very well made, it looks like a jewel. This album is a must have, I recommend everyone to get this CD to their collection.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the music of Bob Dylan.  In fact I own quite a few of his albums.  The problem is that I am not a fan of his lyrics.  Dylan has been known to be inconsistent in his lyrics and his musical arrangements are usually not that interesting.  This is my second Dylan album I have purchased.  I liked the first one much better.  This one does not have a single song I particularly like.  I have heard this is a Dylan album from someone else than Dylan.  I am not sure what else they could have done to improve the album.  This is a bit of a disappointment for me.  I am not sure if I would buy another Dylan album.  At least I am not sure that I would buy another Dylan album.

Amazon review: I have not listened to this album in a long time, but I have been told it is a pretty good record.  I can hear the influences of Bob Dylan and of The Band on this album.

I think this one has some good songs, but I think there are some others that I would not mind listening to.  I was not sure if this was a Dylan album, but I was not disappointed.  I am not sure what else they could have done to improve this album.  I was very happy with this purchase.  I still have the entire album in my CD collection.

Amazon review: I am always surprised by the quality of Bob Dylan's recordings.  The first one I purchased was the 1965 "Desire" album.  I liked the songs that Dylan had written, but I did not like the singing of him.  I do not know if Dylan knew that he was not a great singer, but I think he should have known.  I was very impressed with the quality of this album.  This is the only Dylan album that I have listened to, since it was released.  I am sure I will buy more of his albums, but I probably will not buy this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There are a few good songs on this record, but the most interesting thing is the way Bob Dylan recorded... The way that he recorded his songs, he did not make any mistakes that are too noticeable.  He was very professional.

I do not know if I really liked this album, but I found it interesting.  I had not listened to any of Bob Dylan's albums in a long time, but I saw this album at the local music store and I noticed it had the same album cover as the Dylan album that I had.  I was happy when I found out that it was a live recording.  I was happy about that, because it meant that I would actually get to listen to this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review:  This is probably the best album I have ever heard.  From now I will always remember when I was a child listening to this album. It was the first album that I really fell in love with.  It is the same with this album.  The first time I heard the song "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" I was so in love with the song.  I just kept listening to it over and over.  My Mom's brother is also a musician and he said that he played this song on his guitar at a concert.  He was so good at playing the song.  I would love to hear what his version would sound like.  I believe that this album is one of the best albums ever.  I don't think that the album can be beaten.

Amazon review: I love the music but this cd is just not very well designed. This is a problem not only with the packaging, but also the CD itself. The artwork is terrible. One of the songs has the same lyrics on it as the song on the cd. The CD opens with the opening theme and then the cover art. The cover art is very small and hard to read. The songs themselves are small. The lyrics are too long. They don't flow very well. The CDs sound too similar to each other. As a result, the songs get lost in the shuffle. Overall, this is a terrible cd.

Answers

I agree that this is true.  I think it is a good song in the sense that it is a good example of something that doesn't have to do with the singer.  It is good because it is a song that could be sung by any other person.  It also helps us to learn that we are not the only person that we can be.  The song says it all.  It can be a song that is sung by anyone.  It can be a song that is sung by a mother, or a friend, or a stranger.

2

I think that this is true.  Music is a one-person production.  It is not that we are all singers, but that we each have our own voices and we are all singing different parts.  The whole idea of the song is to make us think about this fact.  This is why we cannot sing the same song twice.  This is also why the lyrics of songs have to be different.

3

I think this is true.  There is no way that the song could be sung by someone else.  I think that the song is a real song because it is not just a collection of words and some music.  The song is a collection of words and music.  There is no way to sing this song at the same time.  It would not be musical or musical enough.  It would not be a song.  It would not be a song that you hear on the radio.  It would be something that you heard in your head.  The song is just an example of a song.  It is not like a song that someone else sings.  This is why sometimes people sing other songs at the same time.  The song is a song, but there is no way that anyone can sing it.

I think this is true
