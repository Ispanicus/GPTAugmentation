Amazon review: When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.  Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I've ever bought from Amazon.  I've been buying music from CD Baby for years because it's convenient and I can listen to it on my iPod without having to go to my computer.  But this is the first CD I've ever bought from Amazon and I just can't seem to get into it.  It's not just the music.  The website is confusing and the customer service is just plain weird.  I finally found a CD Baby employee that was nicer and less frustrated with me than the ones at Amazon.  That employee wasn't very nice but I can't imagine any other CD Baby employee being any nicer.

This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: I love the classic Moonglows recordings.  So I was delighted to see that I could purchase them on Amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl.  oops - I downloaded "I Was Wrong" and it was COMPLETELY NOT THE ORIGINAL DOO WOP VERSION of the song.  This version has a strong background track, it is highly produced, it is just off.  This is just my taste, but the new version of the tune was awful and not what I was looking for at all.  Anyone interested in classic Moonglows tracks should BEWARE before buying these.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has always been a band I looked down upon, their cd Chuck really anti-impressed me except for "Welcome to Hell" which is the only reason I'd like it, and this album is very similar in that aspect. The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear "Nothing on my Back" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually. at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

The production is solid, the lyrics are tight and fun, and the music is catchy.

I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: I'm a little biased, but I like this CD. I like the lyrics, I like the melodies, and I like the arrangements. I listen to this CD for the instrumental interludes or when I want to hear the songs in their original order. The album has a good mix of R&B, Pop, and Rock tracks that I enjoy. I would give it 5 stars if I could, but I can't.

Amazon review: I am the kind of person that likes a lot of songs in a row. I don't like to change the order of songs in my head. So I like this album because it's in my head all the time. I like it when the songs are mixed in with a really good instrumental track. Other than that, I don't really know much about this album. I love the songs, but I don't know much about the artist. I'm sure it's a really good artist, but I don't know anything about her.

Amazon review: This probably is NOT the recording of this much praised song that you want - go to the album "I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight" and try the song there first.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really great recording, I hope it makes the top ten!  The only problem I have with it is that I think some of the vocals are a bit too high and some other voices a bit too low.  I like the sound of it, but I am not sure that I like the vocals.  And I think I like the version of the song that I have.

Amazon review:  This is the 2nd best ever recording of "Silent Night", but it's not the best ever.  I don't think it is a very good recording, but it's better than the version that was released on the "The Christmas Album" and it's better than the one in the "Christmas Album" 2nd CD.
I don't really like this version of the song.  It's not really a Christmas song.  The singing is not very clear and the quality of the recording is poor.

Amazon review:  I have an album of Christmas music and this is the only version I have ever heard.  I think this is the best version of the song.

It is very good for Christmas.

Amazon review:  For some reason, even though I have been listening to this version non-stop since it came out, I still can't get enough of this version of "Silent Night".  It is beautiful.  I love the vocal harmonies.  I think it is one of the best Christmas songs ever.

Amazon review:  "I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight" was the only Christmas album that I ever bought.  I love it!  This is a very good recording.  But...it's not really Christmas music.  So what?

Amazon review:  This was the only version I ever heard.  I think this is a really good version of the song.

His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.

I am not a Dylan fan but if he was playing in a big concert hall at the time I would give him a pass since he has proven himself to be one of the best musicians in the world.  He is not here and I would not miss his song if he was.  I am not a fan of his music and have never been.  I am not sure why he is here.

Amazon review: Mr. Fredricksen, you have done a wonderful job for all of us who love the music of the 70s.  We were all a little disappointed with Mr. Fredricksen's choice of songs for this CD.  I think he should have played the songs he had performed on his 70s tour with CSNY.  I think he should have played the songs he played on his '70s Country tour in the 70s with CSN to the extent that the CD has been made.  The songs on the CD are the songs that I would have liked to have heard on the CSN Country Tour in the 70s.  The songs he played with CSN were better.  He should have played his own material.  The songs he played with CSN were a little too much of the same.  If he had played his own material, the songs he played with CSN would have been better.  Most of the songs he played with CSN were the same old songs he has been playing since he started playing guitar in the early 70s.  The songs on the CD that he played with CSN were not the same old songs played on his CSN Country Tour with CSN.   I would like to hear him play some of his own songs.  He played them with CSN for the most part.  I am not a fan of CSN but I was a fan of his Country Albums.

Amazon review: I have read several reviews on this CD.  It was disappointing.  At least we have a CD from the 70s without any Dylan.  I am not a Dylan fan so I am not sure what it was other than Dylan did not inspire me.  I am not a fan of his music.  I was hoping that he would be playing some of his own material on this CD but he only played some of his own material on his CSN Country Tour with CSN.  I don't like the fact that Bob Dylan is here.  I think he is more of a folk singer than a rocker. His voice sounds flat and his choice of songs (all of them) are dated. He is not a fan of his music.  I am not a fan of his music and have never been, but I was a fan of his CSN Country Albums.

Amazon review: I have not played this CD.  I would like to hear a few songs but I am not sure if this CD has enough songs on it.  I didn't purchase this CD so it did not affect my purchase.  I was happy with the way it turned out.  I would like to hear a few songs but I am not certain if it has many songs.  I don't like the way Bob Dylan is playing guitar.  The only thing that I liked about him was his guitar playing for the most part but I liked the way he sang for the most part.  He has too much of the same old songs here.  I do not like how he is playing guitar.  The only good part about him was his voice.  The reason I bought this CD was that I wanted to know what happened to him.  I think I would have liked to have heard some of his own songs.  I hope he does play some of his own songs on this CD.  He played CSN's songs with them on his CSN Country Tour with CSN.  I hope Bob Dylan plays a few songs on his own or plays them with his own band on this CD.  I hope he plays some of his own songs on this CD.  I hope he plays a few songs on this CD.  I hope he plays some of his own songs.  I hope he plays some of his own songs.  I would like to hear some songs but I am not certain if this CD has enough songs on it.  I didn't purchase

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

A Little Background
Jim is my good friend and fellow country fan. We met when we were both students at the University of Tennessee. He was a great guy to have on your side. He would always listen to your favorite songs and encourage you to pick your favorite artist. I can’t believe it has been 8 years since we first met.

I first met Jim in 2004 when my freshman year at UT. While walking to class around 1:00 pm, we saw each other in the parking lot. I thought Jim was a tall guy with a great beard and a great smile, so I walked over and introduced myself. We walked to class and then for lunch. After class, we went to the library. I can still remember sitting down in the great library and talking to Jim for a while. I had never met anyone who was like Jim or who could make me laugh.

We talked a little

Amazon review: A long time ago when I was younger I used to listen to the song "All You've Got" by The Commodores. I used to listen to that song with my mom and sister and always remembered it. Now that I'm older I started listening to it again, and it made me think of my mom. I remembered that she used to sing it to me when I was younger. "All you've got" is the best thing that I've read so far in this book. It really touched my heart and I hope that it makes you think of your mom too.

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.

It shows that he is really growing as a writer and this album definitely shows that.

Amazon review: Love it. hate it. It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away. Mainstream rock wasn't supposed to be THAT good. not at that time anyways.  It changed the mainstream.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an album of songs that are all very similar and yet in some ways very different. The songs are all written by different writers, but in one way or another the vocals are consistent and the lyrics are all similar.

Amazon review: I'm starting to think that the music industry is actually making money off of these people. I understand that they need to make money, but at what cost?  I'm sure that these singers and musicians are doing something great and inspiring people to be better and to live the best life one can.  At the same time, I'm not sure that the people who are selling these albums need to get paid.  At least a few of these artists are making a living off of their lives of making music and trying to inspire people to be better.  These artists are giving life and happiness to people through their music.  I was very excited to buy this album, and it was great.  But I'm realizing that I just don't need to buy music these days. I have so many other books and books that I need to buy from Amazon.

Amazon review:  I have purchased a lot of books from Amazon, and in all honesty, most of these books are well written and have some worthwhile content.  This book however,  I felt that it is just another example of how the music industry is only in it for the money.  As you can see from the reviews, some of the reviewers felt that this book was a waste of time and money and some felt it was worth reading.  I personally felt that it was a waste of money.  I know that I could read it and learn something from it, but I don't need to know about it.  It is a waste of money.  I can't even afford to buy an entire copy of this book, so I don't even want to buy it.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.

Amazon review: Absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence. An endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it, for exampl,e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" things on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The
Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mainly) of a quality so good you will be amazed. Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My
Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by
great artists.

Amazon review: I have had this CD for a few months now and I just love it.  This band has been around for a long time and I can't belive that I have not heard of them.  I never got into punk rock or the new wave/gospel/jazz/etc bands, so I never had the chance to hear them.  I did like "The End of the Beginning" and "Temptation" but I am glad I have just discovered them.  I was born in 1968 and most of the songs on this CD are in my life and songs I have known all my life.  I am a music lover.  I love all kinds of music.  I love the way this band writes songs.  The lyrics are great.  The guitar playing is awesome.  This is a great band.  I think they should have gotten a better name.  This is a great album.  I think this album is worth a lot more.  I like this album a lot.  I am glad I have found this album.  I listen to a lot of new bands.  I don't like to be a "band fag" but I like to hear new bands.

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.
