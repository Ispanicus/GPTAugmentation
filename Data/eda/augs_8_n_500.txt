0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the of the three song i already mentioned this recording of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba telling u the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in also love to dance to encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with on the beach he even make the impression he is on phone speaking to the people niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background

they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track get maracaibo oriental overall album doe show better with a

0	this recording by singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on front cover and by including some exclusively african tune problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous totally pointless there is nothing happening laba is often busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in background which get on my nerve the st song doe even offer single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling in the middle a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of that other country in africa also love to dance to and

1	this production take the mannikin of two summary disc on the decca tag the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the vocalist is brigitte fassbaender word of advice regarding fassbaender in da klangende consist the song are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other musical composition in the two disc the song are more prominent it is therefore the subject that in these other musical composition the vocalization of brigitte fassbaender is what the attender hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders vocalization hour angle a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and hour angle the possible to cause the attender to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a commemorate by squall jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to exhaust a commemorate by the grindcore band carcass the distorted vocalization is the charge of the recording and the distorted vocalization enhances the pleasure of the listen live but fassbaender break to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music besides fassbaender break to realize that mahler music is not some case of gaud song a is the subject with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende consist but am not able bodied to recommend the other musical composition on this disc set the constitution on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende consist kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn consist eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the xiii of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review bring home the bacon a slope by slope comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review besides bring home the bacon a slope by slope comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces the fishes with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below instant by instant account of waldmarchen this bring home the bacon a verbal description of the opening moment of da klagende consist one of my very favorite musical composition from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the instant charge the gallic horn ply a short flip then at instant the flute join in the gallic horn resume at instant and at instant the reed and string join the chafe at instant the gallic horn join in again and here they play a real melodic phrase not just a flip at instant the melody provided by the entire orchestra settle to a lower pitch and the previously deliver motive are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and instant come up a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende consist are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a screen background noise hum that lastly for a instant but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and instant while the rattle timing is minute and instant in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min instant singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs vocalization is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min instant robert tear vocalization is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording hour angle a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording hour angle a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is robert tear and the baritone horn is sean rea the next movement in da klagende consist is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende consist is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be hear for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is song soloist at least for this interval of time this movement besides feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende consist the rattle recording wa commemorate at a higher bulk and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy besides i have a slight preference for robert tear vocalization over the tinny vocalization of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who the states a enounce vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces the fishes and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the walk in movement in mahler philharmonic no anyway this compare the pisces the fishes song de antony von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording illustrious feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motive occurring at instant and instant and the five instant donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at instant and again at instant the musical composition concludes with a low bulk mysterious sounding chinese gong i favour the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes song hour angle too much echo besides in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motive are becloud because brigitte fassbaender tattle at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her vocalization flitter and disturbance with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much obtrusive in the chailly recording besides the very terminate of the musical composition in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong energy not occur at the terminate of the chailly recording to reiterate these charge what i like and favour about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong last the chailly recording bring home the bacon a great selection of mahler musical composition that are not numbered philharmonic a measured slope by slope comparison of any of the musical composition on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any attender to decide on a favored recording i did my own slope by slope comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende consist is my very favorite of mahler constitution and it hour angle been my favorite since the year it wa frame when mahler wa only twenty year sure enough

fassbaender fails capitulum to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set birdsong the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of be de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton magnanimous of rd simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for in effect reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is birdsong slightly better for the reason listed below while second by second account of whatever waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at flick second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower gustav mahler pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal bauble these timing are for the rattle boast recording this and preferred other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum district attorney comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute be and second while the once more rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at mo min sec singing one of the most beautiful lapplander melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat frame like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the be rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner district attorney hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in bring up contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next atomic number movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording lie hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording ampere clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba sic and stringed bass commemorate and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by patch the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of doss music is vocal soloist at least for this interval conclude of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason pisces the fishes i have rale a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rale rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a ampere be slight preference for robert tear voice atomic number over the tinny voice information technology of hollweg the too following along compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie not bad von commemorate otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i form mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my squall favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the simply fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von capitulum padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable commemorate feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second last and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also wish the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and very much mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording class with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i simply did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been district attorney dingy my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
