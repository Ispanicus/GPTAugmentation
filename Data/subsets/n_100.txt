0	Ehhh. not really a song I would recommend, but it was a suggestion I was asked to download for a friend.  I guess if you like country A LOT, then I'd recommend it. its catchy.
0	Bad quality, muffled sound took away the xpected Philly Soul Sound.
0	I wouldn't have listened to this song except I wondered why this person's songs were being sold at the exceptionally high price of $1.29 per.  I thought *maybe* the performance was so amazing that the price was justified.  Unfortunately, this song is another example of bland, overly loud (probably highly compressed) pop music in a time when "pop" continues to have a pejorative connotation.  Where this singer's voice ends and the production begins is impossible to discern- making it difficult to rate the strength and quality of his voice, but I'd liken it to those from power-pop groups of the 80's, e.g. Journey.  The cover photo is laughably/gaggably pretentious.
0	Song blows just like they other Flo Rida song
0	I love the song, but I wanted the version without the 2 false starts at the beginning. I wanted the video version! Now I have to find an app that can clip that s* out. The sample should be longer so you can really hear the song.
0	They should pay me to listen to this! It was one of the worst songs of all time. Im glad it was free.
0	This is the song from the movie FEAR with Reese Witherspoon in case you were looking it up for that reason.
0	Am not able to pull it up.  To listen to the song
0	Bought it for my Spanish speaking spouse, who is now  questioning my cultural tastes.
0	These are not them.  Though nice, they are covers of the original with studio musicians and vocalists.
0	I really appreciate Sturgil's creativity and effort to defy genre boundaries. But count me in the camp of listeners that were truly energized with his previous efforts. While his 2nd album explored lyrical concepts not seen in country, it still retained an authentic country sound. This album bucks all of those sounds in favor of a hodge-podge of instrumentation. I like brass, I like organs, I like gang vocals, but I'd be much happier if Simpson continued down his previous path of creating throwback country music with modern themes. I'm nostalgic about the past andI have a high regard for artists that carry on a torch against all odds, regardless of the genre they pledge allegiance to.   I don't fault an artist for experimentation, but this album has alienated me. I can almost feel Simpson's desire to NOT be labeled country shining through on this effort, and fans like me will surely piss him off (don't try to label me, fans). To that I say this, Iron Maiden has retained a massive, and cult following by preserving a sound despite of genre changes, lack of radio support, and the changes of media consumption.  If you find yourself wanting authentic county, in a modern era, I strongly suggest you buy some Dale Watson to hold you over until if/when Simpson decides he is once more interested in Country.
0	I am a big fan of Jesse Cook, own every album he has ever released and truly enjoyed his rhythmic, upbeat, passionate guitar. I must say, I am disappointed with this album. The guitar sound is not as prominent as in his earlier work (and why, oh why Jesse.?), there is not a single upbeat song, and frankly it is rather dull and boring. Also, in each every one of his previous albums, there has always been one (or more) songs that I just could not listen enough. Not so with this album. There is not a single memorable song that sticks in your mind. Good for background music while you are doing something else, but not much more.  Jesse, listen up: Ok, I get it. Every now and then an artist may want to try something new, force him/herself out of his/her comfort zone. That is great. except this album isn't. Look, we will forget this one, look the other way, let it slide, call it an experiment, if - and only if - you promise to return real soon with more of those super intoxicating rhythmic melodies of yours (such as Cafe Mocha, Viva, Mario Takes a Walk, Bogota by Bus, Gaita, etc.).  Kapish? Ok, now get back to work.
0	This sounded like something that someone just threw together.  I could not use any of it and none of the songs were complete.
0	This album is ungodly bad. Corey Feldman needs people in his life to tell him when something is obviously terrible. He is delusional to think this is good in any conceivable sense. Then he gets surprised when people laugh at him on the today show lol gimme a break! There are a ton of acts that deserve that today show gig over you Corey.
0	Fancy is the only fun song on this album, the rest seems like she's trying to hard to prove something. only bought it cuz it was $5 bucks.
0	Playback error. Tried to delete and it will not play past 11 seconds. Overall disappointed in cloud player. I really wish you guys could debug it, because I love everything else about your company, and fully support.please fix soon.
0	I hate the new cloud thing.  I used to be able to burn a compilation disc when I bought from you.  I will never buy from you again unless this is explained.  greggramstrom@hotmail.com
0	I'll be honest, I was never a big fan of BB but my older brother was and I liked a few of their songs off past albums. I was curious to see what they came up with after being gone for around 6 years. Unfortunately this album has nothing interesting to offer. It's just cliched predictable radio rock with no heart or edge to it. I swear the chorus of the song "failure" felt like a Kelly Clarkson song. I feel like BB really could've come back with some urgency and bite to them but it's just the same stuff they've always done. They pretend to be heavy, they pretend to write interesting hooks without actually doing so. If someone wants to hear some good accessible hard rock/alt. metal then try Chevelle, Sevendust, or Helmet. All of those bands are heavier and simply write more interesting and creative material.
0	I ordered a CD for this item and received a DVD.
0	Well, i must confess that i was already to buy this item, but first i was searching clear data of this set before, even i heared the entire album, and one of the more strange curiosity of this book, is that there is not music exactly that Brian Eno play, just some ambient sounds that give some atmosphere to the Peter Sinfield's narrative.  Is the item a colection piece? yes it is, only 1000 copies were made, is very rare to find? yes it is, and maybe is more relevant to know that aparently the original tape was destroyed.  I'm a KING CRIMSON Fan & collectionist for almost 20 years ago, i have been buyer of all material that all ex members of the band have produced, and this item awoke my interest for the Peter Sinfield participation, and for the Designs of the book, so i think those two reasons were the cause of the two stars.  If you are a lover of the literature, this item could be great for you but if you are a music lover don't buy this set. For all whose love the sense of progressive music and Crimson esence, i recommend the only one album that Peter Sinfield did "Still", that's a great work full of sublime nuances and that Crimsonian touch of albums like In the Court of the Crimson Kings, In the wake of Poseidon, Lizard and even Island.

0	I am dissapointed, I ordered a Video and received 2 cassette tapes, I wanted the video, because my Father played the violin on The Melody Ranch Show with Carl Cotner.  I have not had a chance to listen to the tapes.  I still want to find out how I can order a video of the shows.
0	I wish I had my money back.  Two CD's with only two or three good songs.  I expected much more.
0	I got this with the idea that it was a professionally done cd as most on Amazon are.  Unfortunately not only do we get the sound of a man singing in a tin can, but these bad sounds are marred by bad lyrics.  All gloriously saved on a cdr. that's a cd-recordable disc.  Various brands used so there is no real brand and the sticker label along with badly printed artwork make this a waste of time and money.  I had to return it because of the unplayability.  If Bill is going to use bad product then this bad review should not come as a surprise.
0	not my cup of tea, terrible covers.  glad i received it as a present . after a listen i will cancel my plans  to see them live.  love steve earle, have seen him several times with different musicians.  not sure why i did not take to this collaboration at all.
0	While i Have been a fan  for more than twenty years,and like many of you will buy a Rippingtons CD  with no questions,this one leaves me flat and not wanting more. I understand the desire to put forth something fresh,but this band has been forged by driving sax based rhythms,along with tremendous acoustic material. After all , Russ Freeman just about created smooth jazz. So, after twenty + years and tons of terrific music what does Russ have left to say? Whatever he wants,and we'll buy it!
0	Zero. Can't get it to play without amazon music.  I can't just purchase the song and play it? Rediculous
0	This album is a personal favorite, but i received this vinyl warped and pitch altered.
0	DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS ONE.  LOVE JOHNNY CASH BUT THE SOUND ON THIS ONE IS NOT GOOD.  SORRY THAT I DOWNLOADED IT TO MY KINDLE.
0	If womanizing is OK with you, go for it.  If violence against women and rape is OK, enjoy!  Personally, I'm offended and outraged.  If beautiful hookers and cute little boy rappers turn you on, it's for you.  Millions of the ignorant masses have fallen in love with the catchy tune (directly translated from German: "Ear-worm").  It's in my head and I may need therapy to get it out.  I'll be requesting a refund on this one.  If you like it, I'm sorry.  Morals are not known to many these days.  "Thicke" & co:  how do you feel knowing that a woman is being raped right now, as her "man" tells her sweetly, "I know you want it."
0	The heading says it all. I downloaded it and it is not on my tablet. need I say more. good thing I had credits.
0	Let me try to be clear, though I'm sure I'll still be branded a troll: I love The Stephanie Miller show and listen to it every weekday morning, and I loved the Sexy Liberal concert we went to. I also love funny raunch. But this collection is awful.  I'm sure they were hilarious to each other sitting around drinking, but to a sober dude who really looked forward to listening to these bits. that is some seriously banal and trite material. My friends at our Happy Hours are much funnier, more interesting and entertaining than this best-of happy hour show compilation. UNLESS you are the kind of person who finds using taboo words IN ITSELF funny. And if you do, here you go. you are so going to love this. But if you're a fan of wit or parody or insight or satire or amusing observations or hell, even just funny dirty jokes, give this a big old pass.  And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the crap sound quality, but that seems a little bit like complaining that the food was horrible and the portions too small.  And that's my regretful but honest opinion. Now let the accusations that I'm a conservative plant fly. As a small business owner who listens to both sides, I take offense.  No. It actually pained me to write this, but I'm harder on my friends than I am on my enemies, and while I expect stupid, unfunny crap from conservatives, this was a real sucker punch from otherwise reliably excellent progressives. If they were to just do what they do on the radio show, but uncensored, that would be awesome. This is just an exercise in leaving the fart machine running and running and running with nothing brilliant in between.
0	This piece of crap wouldn't play- nothing. Silence. I'd return it but it's too much trouble. Ten dollars down the drain for nothing.
0	Hate it, don't care for rap music.can't believe people wasted their time listening to this awful music. I sure don't care f it
0	Now, I suppose you're wondering if it's fine why the one star review?  I love Coheed and Cambria, I own all their albums, and I've read all of the Amory Wars stuff. Concept or none aside, the music in this album is so unimaginative and straight down the middle when compared with the others.  The album itself is poorly constructed, whether or not an album has a concept to it, I'm still looking for the songs to be organized in such a way that they complement one another, so that once I start the album I don't want to stop.  Long short of it is it gets a single star because I believe in Co and Cam, and while it's fine, they can do so much better and so much more interesting than just fine.
0	You- yes you mr Record company- such a blatent demonstration of greed does not go unnoticed, particularly in this economic climate. It is this arrogance that brought about the calamitous wall street debauchery that has hurt so many people. I will not buy this song- perhaps a boycott of this record company would be a good idea.
0	Musically, this disc is a boon. As recorded sound, it's an assault on the ears. Unfortunately typical of Italian digital transfers from the 1990's, this CD is based on sound from the late 1930's that should be warm and agreeable- EXCEPT that many listeners have no appetite for the surface noise in the original recordings. This surface noise, as it happens, is the very air in which the antique sound swims. If you let the surface noise remain, you hear the full spectrum of sound. To eliminate the noise, you must cut out a great part of the atmosphere. In sonic terms, it's like looking at a ninety-year-old with multiple face-lifts- a parody of the original sound, just as the face-lifted human is a parody of the former self.  The net result is a disagreeably high-pitched sound that attacks the ears. Volume and treble have to be strictly controlled in order for the sound to become palatable. The music's original beauty is lost. The Pro Arte recordings of Haydn quartets, it seems, have never had fully successful transfers to compact disc. The listener would be well advised to look out for the LP's, or to find other digital transfers that are less offensive than the ones produced by this company. The ones by Allegro aren't bad: http:/ www.amazon.com/Haydn-String-Quartets-Vol-1/dp/B00005YHZA/ref=sr_1_5?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1440204628&sr=1-5&keywords=pro+arte+quartet+haydn
0	as ordered but I like the original song better
0	The first 5 minutes will help put you a sleep. BUT, if you can't sleep, the music is much repetitive. Almost to boring!
0	Not that I disliked it, it just didn't meet my expectations.  There were only a couple cuts that I really liked.
0	I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.
0	Wow, this is so weird.  It talks and has this bizzare music that is supposed to be motivating.  But all it really motivates me to do is tip my head like my labrador and say, "huh"?
0	the record skips on several songs. The way it was packaged was scary. I am surprised it was not broken.
0	Was really excited to receive this, but did not enjoy this at all.
0	The sound is so thin and has no presence.
0	Sharon McNight is a national Treasure. Plus behind her beautiful voice is even a more beautiful woman. Every song  becomes her own. Sharon reminds me of what they called ladies with big voices even if you're high up. "The Belters" like Ethel Merman and Barbra Streisand come to mind. This my second the fast was a cassette that wore out now its a CD.
0	I love this song and will be playing it at my wedding. Lol
0	What more can I say ? the more I listen to these classics the more I have respect and appreciate groups like "Confunkshun" wish some of these artist from today learn to take a cue from some of these old schoolers who know how to make REAL MUSIC and have the longevity for it.
0	Great song Katy! Love your music. This is one of my favorites. Keep em coming. We'll be waiting for more!
0	That is a good way to return the favor! if the man cheats hit him where hurts the most HIS POCKET!
0	my favorite version of this old classic.  nat King Cole's voice is smooth and  is just right for this beautiful melody
0	Despite the terrible title, this is a superb set of soul from a relatively unknown but phenomenally talented singer.  Jeannie only recorded a handful of singles and two albums before killing her two children and then committing suicide in 1980. This, her first Casablanca album, has been lovingly remastered and expanded by Reel Music, and is on CD for the first time. This edition contains the original 1976 LP plus both of her singles from 1975. Vocally she's not unlike Gladys Knight, with a bit of Laura Lee thrown in (minus the histrionics), and surprisingly- despite the year and the label- there's not even a hint of disco.  While "The Fruit Song" is considered her signature, the real standouts are "The Phone's Been Jumping All Day" (which was her highest charting record), "Hit & Run" & "Unyielding".  Reel Music is a superb reissue label that focuses on 60's to 80's soul & R&B; all mastered from original studio tapes, many on CD for the first time, and most having deluxe booklets containing essays, interviews & photos (except the mini-LPs). Currently all of their titles are in print, and I encourage you to pick them up while you can.  Hopefully they'll also reissue Jeannie's 1977 album "One Wish."  Update (5/11): It looks like Reel Music is gone, so definitely get this ASAP.
1	This is one of those albums that three or four notes in, I already loved it. The musicians are top notch and the singer is really good too.
1	Beautiful arrangements to guarantee inspirational listening.
1	Very soothing and spiritual. You feel like you are floating when listening to this.
1	Folk music represents true spirit music from Peru.  Flutes and guitars provide a lively musical song.  It made me feel as if I were in Peru.
1	This music track definitely has a sense of mystery when I listen to this.  Not one of the most epic tracks I've ever listened to, but a good one nonetheless.
1	This record was great. Just liked it was promised. Pristine and unique and my son-in-law lovedit and that was te whole idea.
1	Every song is unique!  Love this cd!
1	Excellent song I like the guitar solo
1	Was a huge fan of them back in 2000-2001.
1	one of my favorite songs for years, and helped me get thru my father's passing. Very powerful words, I love singing this at the top of my lungs!
1	If you don't already know. this is a Beautiful song. sung by a beautiful Artist. Give it a listen. Tamia - 'Smile'
1	THIS CD IS MORE LIKE HOUSE. TRACKS 1-3 SUCK BUT THE REST ARE UNIQUE AND BASS POUNDING
1	This album is a stepping stone for these two veterans. They both had plaques for their solo ventures and numerous gold plaques for their album. Business wise this was a good move. But I miss that Suave House sound which made them legends. But I am willing to give them a chance anyday. This album is definitely hot though. Top 3 Songs, You Don't Want Drama, Don't Make, Look AT The Grill Bottom 3 Songs: When It's On,Streets,  Gangsta Sleeper: Forever
1	Sting outdid himself on this song. It is remeniscent of the early Police, up beat and very danceable. Inspirational revelations of love as the meaning of life celebrates human existence. There is some serious Rastafarian content in this song.
1	I pre-ordered this release a few weeks ago and was able to download the album from the breith.com site.  Really enjoying the new tracks.  Highly recommend you pick it up.
1	Fantastic harmonics. Listening with Base headset is a tremendous experience.
1	Even though i love Harry Potter, I have never been fond of "wizard rock" but this is a pretty good CD. I like they beats and vocals, but the lyrics are okay. But overall I like the acoustic sound over their normal pop/techno feel.
1	His music had a very strong middle eastern influence, which personally I liked. .
1	Saw this group last summer and loved them - have really enjoyed listening, and even dancing with my kids a bit!
1	The songs on the album are very inspriation, a few times it actually brought tears to my eyes.  Jimmy Deane is great
1	For those of you who aren't familiar with Virgil Donati he is one of the most amazing innovative drummers around. Period. His ability to play multiple time signatures simultaneously is rivaled by none that I've ever heard. I discovered him while listening to Steve Walsh's Glossolalia album and then rediscovered him playing with Derek Sherinian on some of his solo works and also with Planet X. I've been a devout fan ever since. This dude is freaking SICK! On this record he really stretches the limits of my musical sensibilities which by most standards is miles beyond insane to begin with and has of course surrounded himself with the talent to pull off these maneuvers with seamless ease. It is simply mind blowing that someone can conceptualize & compose this kind of stuff let alone perform it to this degree. The compositions on this album are extremely complex and never really lets the listener get too comfortable with the deep grooves before the piece moves to the next tantalizing yet tension filled musical theme. This album is truly a prog-heads dream! After a few times through it all starts to make more musical sense and the ideas start to take on some relative familiarity. So as a colossal prog head I highly recommend this album to all the like minded freaks out there looking for more brain candy. If you think this might be a bit too radical of a place to start perhaps Planet X's Quantum would be a more musically friendly introduction to the world of the brilliant "Thunder from Down Under" Mr Donati.
1	It's Christmas most of it was beautiful music playing. There was some singing involved but I wanted to here the song" miss you this Christmas" and it's Free.
1	Great Johnny mathis tune. I use it as a "modern"  romantic waltz dance tune.
1	This is great tune with many refrences to the(GB) culture in 1985. The lyric "We go Port Plaza" brings me right back. It is a great song to listen too before Packer games to get excited!  For anyone from the U.P. or north east Wisconsin this song should make you smile!
1	Absolutely amazing start to finish. Been looping it and hearing more and more stuff. This is a prog rock opera for the ages!
1	This is an album that I listen to straight through over and over again without skipping anything.  It's so mellow and chill and it all flows together well.  Great baby-making music.
1	This song, the whole cd is a classic
1	how can you not like Bruce? I don't know about music, I just like to listen to it.
1	Love this song. Beautiful complimentary voices!
1	this song was a huge radio hit when it came out.  i missed not hearing it so had to buy it.
1	Maddy has such a sweet voice, just had to but this collection, was not disappointed
1	I didn't have this song and needed to add it to my collection. I love this song. Another Whitney classic.
1	Good song that expresses what every soldier faces.  Sad but true.  Sad that our politicians never have to face that.
1	My Dad turned me on to this and I didn't realise I had already heard it and wondered who it was by years before and again with the release of Curious George. Now I can get all his tunes and they are great hanging out back on the lanai music with a beah. They make for good happy. Not hop up and down happy but more contented sigh in a sunpuddle happy. Try one you will like his banana pancakes!
1	I love this song. At this time it is my favorite.
1	An awesome set to start with your musical journey with the artist's works. Thanks for this!
1	Have given this to several beginners who have shared it with their friends. Many healers and masssage therapist's have borrowed it and then purchased it for their own use. Highly recommend it.
