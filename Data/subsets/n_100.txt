1	The selection of songs is out of most Boomers reference point--'30's-50's.  I am a Boomer and these were my parent's songs.  One thought-  maybe he did not have to pay royalties?  Very subdued vocals, very different. Listen to each before you buy the ten...and the length is 35 minutes.
1	It's bound to happen in today's economy. A band develops a style all their own and then abandons it to make it more "marketable." This is a watered down Disturbed. They got down with the sickness, "Marketability."
1	The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.   As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.   So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.   Released in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover. Songs: I CAN'T HELP MYSELF, JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES, DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL, COME SEE ABOUT ME, NOWHERE TO RUN.
1	Si hubiese sabido las canciones que tiene, no lo hubiese comprado.
1	This is an almost entirely predictable dance remix of the original song, and, honestly, Lana could have re-recorded this to the 'dance' tempo and it probably could have been excellent.  Some positives: 1) If you don't know who Lana is or her style, you will probably think this is good. She knows how to use her voice and how the notes closed would have been totally different (fitting of the tempo) if she'd have re-recorded, however, which would have left you with an even better impression. 2) The person doing the remix didn't go for all of the overdone things that 'make it sound cool' (to whom?)  They didn't totally saturate the bass, and they didn't push the tempo farther than what the original could have supported.  They did, however, resort to enough of the rank-and-file remix stuff to call this a 'dance mix'.
1	Didn't realize it was the edited version of the album. Would not have bought it if I knew. Oh well.
1	I have to give this 2 stars only because it was used in the exorcism of the evil spirits I my house . I.also use the song along with her photo in the toilet for when I am constipated . My only problem now is our dogs howl and disturb the neighbors when I have these movements. Beside the fact she is hiring a Cop Killer I would not recommend this unless you house is completely taken over by demons or you are out of suppositories
1	His vocals are too modern country. The songs are depressing and mundane. They are all too similar. It just goes on for too long.
1	I can't really review this song as it never downloaded to my device, and it isn't on the cloud player.
1	The sound quality of this album is awful.  Her music is beautiful but this album does not do it justice.
1	Rod is terrific in whatever he does. The Great American Songbook series is a big hit. However, compared with albums I thru IV, V seems to fall behind. Dancing to the "big bands" is fine but every song has the same tempo and boredom sets in. Who really wants to dance to Moon River?  Just keep listening to I thru IV, over and over and enjoy!; and that's enough!
1	Admit it: There were hundreds of of creative bands out there before, after, and during Nirana's nearly 13-year-and-counting stranglehold on the music world. They're still popular ten years after Cobain gave himself a shotgun facelift because kids these days are too lazy to go out and re-discover the amazing music of the past that they missed while in their mother's womb. Nirvana was never creative or experimental. I've heard every single one of their albums, the 1987 KAOS show, and their first show they ever played in March of 1987 in Raymond, WA. Simply put, the band blows dog. Same goes for their 1/23/88 gig they did after their Endino session. And do you know what Kurt opened the show with? He said to the audience, "I have a big white di_k". Nice opener for such an "artist" who was against macho posturing, huh? If you ever get to hear the Raymond 1987 show, it'll turn any Nirvana fan into a non-fan, as will 1/23/88. The playing is so bad that it's interesting--interesting to see that Nirvana (or Throat Oyster, or Ted Ed Fred, or Pen Cap Chew, or Brown Cow) was always so ammature. Nirvana never were as good as Nevermind portrays them to be, and the actual extent of their playing ability is found on the crapfest that is Bleach. Mumbling lines like "Smell the smell" and "Pee-pee pressed against my lips" do not get my creative juices flowing, nor do they inspire me to do anything besides crush the damn Bleach record, which I did. It p*sses me off to no end that Kurt Cobain is still wrongfully hailed a genius, while thousands of amazing songs have went under the radar due to the fact he wrongly overshadows the music industry with his music that nobody can relate to. Kurt Cobain wrote music for himself and nobody else. Nobody (not even a fan) can relate to someone like Kurt who didn't want to be related with. You may say you an relate to him, but since he would never reciprocate that adoration, you can't relate to him. He didn't want admiration; he just wanted to sit in the corner like he did a his own Nevermind release party and distance himself from everyone. He wanted to be forgotton, so just let the curmudgeon stay to himself in hell. Ever heard of They Might Be Giants, Bow Wow Wow, PIL, Talking Heads, The B-52's, The Fixx, Missing Persons, or Concrete Blond? Didn't think so.
1	Awesome Luther. This cd does alll justice for you. I really love come all ye faithful. Awesome cd! Good price.
1	ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.
1	First roar & now this stinking up the airwaves & its hitting up the charts? Will she ever go away? nice going people , You don't know what good music is anymore.
1	I became aware of this band while watching the crappy movie "The Roommate".  The song "Houses" plays as the credits roll.  I was intrigued by the sound of the Band and the voice of the lead singer Rachel Stolte.  Rachel has a great voice.  I could literally listen to her sing the phone book, which is a good thing because the lyrics make about as much sense.  This is a band with a great sound and nothing to say.  I can only hope that (a) Rachel hooks up with another band or (b) these guys hire a lyricist because I've found deeper meaning on Hanson records.
1	i agree with the points made by the previous reviewer. the cover photo made me think after he brought it up. i thought for awhile and then it hit me-the group on the cover is a 1969 photo of johnny maestro and the brooklyn bridge.
1	The single star is not for Grace's album... it is for the profiteers.  Booooo.
1	This album is wack, yo. Hip-hip by the numbers with an emcee who can't rhyme and radio-friendly fodder like '21 Questions' but it don't matter, cus HE BEEN SHOT NINE TIME! I've heard better 'music' at the National Zoo (primate house) but it doesn't matter. No, it doesn't matter one bit. You'll buy this garbage because 50 CENT BEEN SHOT NINE TIMES!
1	As the music industry becomes increasingly homogenized, we still have artists who will fight tooth and nail to maintain their originality.  I would have always thought Jewel to be such an artist; I was wrong.  That Jewel is even drawing comparisons to Britney Spears and Madonna (whom I do admire for all she is) scares the hell out of me. All of Jewel's previous efforts were distinctive -- we knew it could only be Jewel.  0304 just blends in with all the other banal pop music that is carefully packaged and heavily marketed to the masses.  Sure, most of us can distinguish her incredible voice, but all else lacks of any progression.  Jewel was never supposed to be "catchy".  I would rather listen to her Christmas collection (Joy) in the middle of July. The story of Jewel's ascent to stardom is quite special.  Her previous works, while all distinct, were based upon her roots, as evidenced by her lyrics and passionate vocals. 0304 deviates far too much from said roots. Remember Dorothy, there's no place like home...
1	I have been waiting for this CD ever since I fell in love with the Carter II. I expected this to be a classic cd and was hoping his lyrics would continue to get better. I can honestly say this CD was not made by the Lil' Wayne most true fans think of. He uses the vocalizer way too much and it makes it almost painful listening to his sophomoric punchlines in several songs.  I can go back to the Carter I and name so many songs that have beats and lyrics that make you stop and wonder how he came up with some of the stuff (BM J.R., This is the Carter, Walk In, We Don't, Bring it Back, Who Wanna...) the same goes for the Carter II (Tha Mobb, Fly In, Money on My Mind, Best Rapper Alive, Lock and Load, Oh No...) I can even name probably close to ten songs he put out on the various mixtapes that would have made a classic hip hop CD (beat without bass, pretty much anything in the drought series...)  It is tough to continue putting out good, fresh material. Wayne made the classic mistake of dropping too much good music out there, when it came time to make a studio album, he was out of ideas and basically threw together a CD that 14 year old high schoolers would think was pretty dope.  It seems fitting that Fabolous and Juelz Santana absolutely MURDER weezy on the track "you ain't got nothin on me"...  My recommendation is to save yourself $9 dollars that wayne will probably end up using to buy lean so he can screw his voice up more...eventually he can double as T-Pain. Put together a compilation of good songs from his mixtapes and just tell yourself that was the carter III.  I am in no way a Wayne hater...I am to this day one of his biggest fans, I was just unfortunately very let down by this poor attempt at record sales. Hopefully he'll bounce back with something that can get this bad taste out of my mouth.  I would give this CD 2.5/5 stars
1	what an obnoxious rapper and unimaginative, predictable singer/song
1	That this song downloads as a separate from 'The Load Out'. Your promoter don't mind, the union don't mind, the roadies don't mind. The verses are specific for this 'Stay' version and is part of 'The Load Out/Stay' compile. Its one song!
1	yuk
1	this album is a bummer.  dance hall, sampling, over-produced.  i miss the older franti, more, well, soulful.  down to earth.  i just listened to this straight through my first & probably last time.
1	This is bad karaoke accompanied by a casio keyboard. I could make a better remix of these songs with a kazoo. Seriously it's bad.
1	I thought this CD was boring, and the explicit language is a turn off.
1	I was very excited to play the CD, once I did that excitement went to disappointment. Sorry Donny!!
1	The quality of her voice sounded immature, the notes of the music were thin and it seemed sometimes to be a little off key.  I am not a music expert by any means, but  I could tell the difference between this version and The End of World (remastered) it was like night and day.  The remastered version is richer, notes have more depth and Ms Davis' voice sounds like a professional and not a teenager singing into a karaoke mike.
1	I think these songs might be great if performed better.  Unfortunately I haven't found any other recordings yet...
1	I'm sorry to say this, but Bl&uuml;mchen has made a bad song! Although I have not heard the original version, which was done by Queen, I can say that this version is terrible! Only a good purchase if you are a Queen fan.
1	yeah, I couldn't listen to this cd much. I listened to the first track and had to skim through the rest. This cd is crap, I'm glad I only paid a dollar for it.  I only gave it 2 stars because the lyrics were somewhat creative.
1	Horrible!
1	I don't want to sound like sour apples but I'll be honest. I received this CD yesterday and listened to it before bedtime. I have 3 audiocassettes of METAMUSIC - MODEM, OUTREACH (both from 1985) & SLEEPING THROUGH THE RAIN (1990) - so I'm not new to the neighborhood. I enjoy them because I like synth "music" and the Hemi-Sync binaural beats are not a factor since I've never experienced anything out of the ordinary. The Monroe Institue explains the benefits of Hemi-Sync but as author Ronald Russell says in his book "The Journey of Robert Monroe", on page 359: "Passively listening to Hemi-Sync binaural beats may not automatically engender a focused state of consciousness."  So there you have it. To me, this CD is a poor product musically speaking and is not as enjoyable as the 3 titles mentioned above. In other words, this type of music with the Hemi-Sync tones embedded may be useful if you have a purpose for using them.  The worst part about this CD is that it starts with a thunderclap that makes you jump out of your underweat! It's not even a good, enjoyable thunderclap. Then the rain follows overloud with more so-so thunderclaps and loud crickets and, eventually, the "music" starts softly and the rain is replaced. It is nice synth "music" but not too long after it drifts off and is replaced by what sounds like a nylon string guitar. Not bad but it's out of place and unnecessary. It drifts off and the synth returns with more nature sounds. It all ends a lousy 28 minutes later! On a CD that can offer 80 minutes! The Monroe Institute offers a ton of similar CDs. I may not buy any of them.  I won't get into Robert Monroe, his OOBEs, his Institute, I'll save it for other reviews.
1	Love
1	Its not the full length song...its about a minute long! Its should be labeled as a "preview" but its not...very frustrating!
1	Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
1	Sections of this are terrific, but some is just bizarre.i
1	This file is damaged, it has skips and pops all through it, artifacts I don't expect with digital.  It's too bad, I love this song. Save your money, it's not listenable.
1	I am so glad I didn't pay for this album, it's not at all what I was hoping for. It's not the full album and doesn't have the actual cast.... SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUT IT!!!
1	didn't really like the song
1	eh, not as good as I thought.  Loved the story about how the band started and how these guys supported each other through a health crisis - that was really the reason I bought it.
1	Too much profanity for my virgin ears. I wish there was a warning on the single song. But there were not warnings. Loved the beat though.
1	This guy is a tool and his music sucks.  He has no place in country music.
1	This was one of the worse songs of the 70s.  Yet, I bought it.  Probably because I remember listening to it on the radio when I was a teenager.  I don't know what type of song this is.  Not rock; blues; rap; country; etc.  Just a strange concoction.  I'm not from Chicago. But I know it didn't die.  It's very much alive.  Whereas Paper Lace must be dead and gone.  So, if your feeling nostalgic, you might want to listen to it again and wonder how you ever might of liked it.
1	This is truly one of the worst attacks on Classical music ever perpetrated by the philistines of this world.  This is not good music, not a good interpretation and not respectful to the composer or his music.  If you love Soul and Hip-Hop, that's fine. If you like Handel, I respect your good taste. This evil and tasteless recording should never have been made. The whole thing sucks.
1	SUCK!  I don't know why I didn't look more closely or listen to it before ordering.  Maybe because Bob has done such great stuff recently, and the large number of positive reviews.  My mistake, and one I won't make again.  After punching through all the tracks in the car, I angrily ejected the CD and whipped it over my shoulder hoping to never see it again.  (I really wanted to throw it out the window) I don't recall ever being this disappointed with a music purchase.  Please read the description and listen to the sample tracks before purchasing-- you might actually like it if you are looking for something completely atypical from Bob that sounds like nothing else in his extensive discography.
1	I love Lucinda Williams' music and feel she might be the premier American songwriter.  That being said, I cannot enjoy this cd because it is too much work to listen too it.  I can't understand most of her lyrics.  I am truly a words and music man so this is hard for me to listen to.  It iOS not cool to whine and mumble through every song.  Please give more thought to annunciation.
1	HERE I AM!!! IS THE BEST THING ON HERE,also, if You Were My Man!!!.Everything else was wacc even that weak sample of "Silly".Shout's ta Lady Dee Dub,also checc out "Free",It's Gonna Take..., & That Family Ties Theme Song.
1	It's impossible to believe that this piece of crap comes from the guy who put out 'La Sexorcisto Devil Music Vol. 1' as part of the group White Zombie.  'Foxy Foxy' is a pop song trying to masquerade as some type of heavy metal, but it fails at both. It's Top 40 longings are ruined because it tries to be heavy, and it's heavy metal attempts are ruined because of it's suary sick drums, repetition, and general formulaic lameness.  This song is such a piece of garbage that it actually makes me angry when I hear it. In fact, it makes me almost as angry as The Worst Song Ever Created, 'Boom Boom Pow'. Both are pop music garbage.  Come on, Rob Zombie, find out where you lost your balls and have them reattached.
0	nice beat loops, reminiscent of 80's beat loops.
0	When i first got this cd, i couldn't stop playing it, and for being live its sounds excellent, i also (like a previous reviewer) hate live cds they are usually quite bad. but not this one.. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes rasputina and needs to complete their collection. but i also recommend this cd to anyone who wants to try something new and won't be disappointed! from the quirky song.. wicked dickie (which is very catchy) to the song i personally love which is Rose. K and her versions of barracuda and rock n roll. and a great song but sad A Quitter. and then theres melora with her banter in between songs (but not so long of a banter that it gets old) just cute little saying and intros.
0	I so embarrass my kids when this song comes on the radio! Like the beat Love the words --- it rocks!
0	great song
0	My daughter loves Carrie Underwood and has all of her cd's.
0	Another great CD by Josh Groban.  All of his music is wonderful and this is no exception.  Love it.
0	Every since Mandia's 'Good Morning' song I have been a fan of hers. This song picks me up and reminds me I am an overcomer! I d not know how anyone could listen to this song and not like or be reminded of what they have gone through in life. Believe in Christ and let your faith be strong, we can overcome whatever may come against us because of Him.
0	This music is the best by far by Donald Byrd . Cristo is powerful and spiritual  sounds.
0	Excellent selections of songs that stood out in the 80's. The ones you can dance to yet also make you think when you're not sweatin' to the 80's. Look up the lyrics; well, if you also have the "can't understand what they'll saying" defect as I do. Some of the songs are even better when you know the words.  Even though I really liked the songs, there are a few that are included on other Time Life cds way too many times, such as "Take on me" by A-Ha. I LOVE that song, but really don't need more than two copies(so far I have four from various 80's music cds).  Here are the titles on the cds:  Disc 1: 1 The reflex - Duran Duran 2 Get it on - Power Station 3 Secret separation - The Fixx 4 Head over heels - Tears for Fears 5 Here comes the rain again - Eurythmics 6 Rock me Amadeus - Falco 7 Take on me - A-Ha 8 Walk this way - Run-D.M.C 9 You might think - The Cars 10 Everybody have fun tonight - Wang Chung 11 No more words - Berlin 12 How soon is now? - The Smiths  Disc 2: 1 Eyes without a face - Billy Idol 2 Something so strong - Crowded House 3 King for a day - Thompson Twins 4 So in love - Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark 5 Show me - The Pretenders 6 It's my life - Talk Talk 7 Something about you - Level 42 8 Original sin - Inxs -- 9 Ways to be wicked - Lone Justice 10 Real wild child - Iggy Pop 11 Cities in dust - Siuoxsie and the Banshees 12 Nineteen forever - Joe Jackson
0	For my money they are the most important American rock and roll band in history. They were a phenomenon to be sure. And the statistics would tend to back up these assertions. Whether you were addicted to Top 40 radio in the 1970's or a fan of progressive or classic rock you were sure to find the music of Chicago emanating from your radio.  It all began with an LP entitled "Chicago Transit Authority" released in the spring of 1969. While the album would never attain Top Ten status it would remain on the charts a staggering 171 weeks! And from this LP would emerge a couple of classic hit singles "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is" and a tune appropriately entitled "Beginnings". And Chicago would never look back. Over the next two decades the band would have over four dozen hit singles and produce some of the finest and most successful albums of the period. "Beginnings" was originally released as a single in 1969 and it failed to make the charts. Columbia decided to re-release the single in June 1971 and it would become the band's fourth Top Ten hit. Outstanding!
0	BSG are the original voices of LRB.  No one can compare.
0	my sister loves it
0	Not sure where this young lady or her "team" comes from but I like what they have to say.  She is definitely a shining star in the world of music right now and I am paying attention.
0	Excellent.  Gives me goosebumps
0	This is a great song easy and soft love music. Love to listen to song on the way to and from work.
0	Great song
0	I heard this from a family member, and had to download it once again.  Reminds me a little of Kansas' Dust In The Wind, but with a twist.  The voice doesn't overpower the song.  A very good, balanced song.
0	This was the 1st CD I ever purchased back in the early ninetie's which introduced me to "new age" music. I lost it about 12 years or so ago, and recently wanted to get it again and found it here on Amazon. Absolutely love this CD, and I think you will to.
0	This is already my favorite album of Old Crow Medicine Show in the short time I've been listening to it. Granted, none of the songs on this album reach the iconic level that "Wagon Wheel" is on, but in a way, that may be a good thing. This album has a great mix of fast paced songs and more slower paced, country-like songs, and they all work wonderfully. "Carry Me Back To Virginia", "We Don't Grow Tobacco", "Ain't It Enough", and "Bootlegger's Boy" are the standout tracks for me, with the first one being a real footstomper and the rest being incredibly great on the ears, too. The only nitpick I have is that the last 2-3 songs aren't as strong as the others, but they're still pretty damn good in their own right.  Love this album. You should definitely get your hands on it.
0	Thank goodness, a dubstep-inspired instrumental jam fest that doesn't scramble my brain!  This album is intriguing, complex, and exciting without that nails-on-a-chalkboard masochism involved in listening to the majority of dubstep.  Start with Fortune Days, then if you like what you hear get the rest to go along with it.
0	Love Kenny G's soothing saxophone music during the holidays!
0	Good song
0	For me and Barry, it's love/hate. I love some of his songs and I hate some of them. I had 2 of his records in my collection that I let go last summer. But sometimes there is a song that I miss and this is one of them.
0	good song for the club make you dance for sure. 2 chainz came hard jeezy killed it. they need to do a remix!!
0	I love this CD. I hear different nuances to the playing and production every time I listen to it, which is often. Every song is great! The evocative lyrics are haunting, poetic, and metaphorical. Highly recommended!
0	Exactly what I was expecting it to be. I am happy with my purchase.
0	Only Pete Server can make music with such heart and soul. The songs will have you singing along and make you feel great. A must have!
0	Amazing, innovative and forward-thinking music!  Aside from the musical material, I especially love the LP-style "warmth" that Rudy Van Gelder achieved in the album's sound.
0	This release has stood the test of time.  It doesn't make me feel like I'm back in the 80's.  Instead it amazes me that her carefully crafted lyrics, Neil's guitar work, sound as great today - if not better due to technologic advances - than they ever been.
0	Love!!!
0	I love the sincerity  of this song.
0	This song is so aswome i downloaded it for my friends tallent show and now i like it it is the best.
0	GREAT PRODUCT!!!
0	Wow, Patrick Fitzsimmons has a really lovely voice and he has written some really wonderful songs on love, life, friendship and folly that are beautifully realized on this album.  It's spare when appropriate and the piano, cello, violin and percussion jump in at all the right places. This is a thoughtful, soothing yet inspired album with real soft corners for hard times.  Everyone should be listening to this album right now.  If you like great acoustic folk rock with a hint of pop, this album is for you.  You'll listen to it over and over because it just makes you feel so good.  Favorites include "Come to Me," "Forgiving You," "Peter's Garden," "Two Birds," "Beautiful Jane," "Old Blue Heart," "Fare Thee Well" and "Gimme' More Love." But really, every song is fantastic.  Frankly, the album is worth buying just for "Gimme' More Love." With sixteen additional songs that are equally outstanding....it's just more love..... Thanks, Patrick!
0	Great song by a great band
0	Diana Krall is a 'real cool chick' on this number.
0	You probably have to be a Rod McKuen fan to really enjoy these albums. They are old now but have brought back so many memories and I can  listen to them all day. Rod's words are wonderful and the music is so easy to listen to. Again and again and again...
0	After 10 years Sevendust pumps out another album that will blow you away.  Expanding on their sound while still maintaining what makes them Sevendust, this album shows a growth lyrically and musically.  From the brutal verses in Inside to the bluesy Progidal Son to the epic Hope (one of their best songs ever) this album has every ingredient in the 7D catalog.  Everyone in the band is at the top of their game and it shows. Lajon Witherspoon shows why he's one of if not the best singer in rock, John Connolly and Sonny Mayo do an excellent job of mixing heavy and melody on(and throwing in the best solos that 7D has ever seen), Vinny Hornsby continues to lay down the solid bass lines and Morgan Rose continues to show us why he has won "Drummer of the Year" in Mordern Drummer magazine twice.  Whether you're a fan of Sevendust or maybe someone who lost touch with the band of the years, or just a fan of rock, this CD is a MUST in your collection.
0	Great song
0	Boswell has put together some very exciting recordings of the most famous voices of PBS. I recommend that everyone get this EP.
0	I originally heard this song on the how, The Vampire Diaries, and just had to have it.  Now that I have it i can't stop listening to it.  It sounds so out of this world, i can relax to it for hours.  They have madde a fan!  Q.
0	One of the best old-school that there
0	Great return by this esteemed artist! Sounds like classic Roger Waters/Pink Floyd. Floyd fans will find many reminders of Dark Side and other classic Floyd albums. Highly recommended!
0	love the movie
0	I love this song, it is classic Amy Winehouse! The song is so soulful and I keep it on repeat!
0	really, i see two bad reviews of this fantastic cd, and it pains me to say that some don't like (in my opinion), one of the best bands of all time.  i think somebody was just trying to bring the average rating down to anger us all, poor poor souls.  just admit that it was one of the greatest albums of all time.
0	Excellent song
0	really sexy voice and great to listen to
0	I own 3 of Julie's CD's and this is one of my favorites. Julie's gifted with the ability to draw a person into the presence of God. You won't be disappointed in listening to this one!
0	Love, love her voice & the music she selects for her albums.  There is no one better to listen to.
