0	It did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it. It's was a waste of my money.
0	to Amazon:  why is this here? i do not remember ordering this, & I never have had it delivered to my home. I know this to be true because I do not own this cd or any REO Speedwagon music
0	had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases! ugghhhh! 17 other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded! ugghhhh!
0	This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
0	It says Brandy featuring Wanya Morris. But once I purchased the song it clearly was just Brandy singing on this song. I think this is false advertising.
0	LAREINE: A Bunch of japanese people trying to look Aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition. It's not gonna happen,guys. I know better.
0	I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago. This is the DGG recording philosophy of playing it safe for play-back system that are the average-cheap and below, down below to the McDonald-duck play-back varieties. It is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration - but on the other hand - it's noting new coming from DGG. If one truly wants to enjoy a great reading, and great illusion of fidelity, let one turn to either a Mercury Living Presence or to RCA living stereo, or look up a modern Decca or EMI Digital recording. As it is here on the DGG - this is an abomination of the Audio goal and truth.
0	Towards the middle/end of the song, Barbra Streisand's part seems quite screechy to me. Sad as this is a great song.  I am surprised it passed anyone's approval.
0	This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.
0	Most songs were lousy; she sings better by herself.
0	I received the CD in a cracked case and the CD was cracked as well! I was planning on giving the CD as a christmas present, but now that will not be possible.
0	Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah. Neither of those girls know how to sing, you used to. I want my ol' Marie back, till then I'll be using this cd as a coaster, while I sip Hot cocoa while I enjoy your OLDER albums. BTW you BUTCHERED the christmas standard SLIEGH RIDE. thanks ALOT!
0	Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
0	When I ordered this cd I made a mistake, I thought I was ordering a Bruno Mars album, I liked Uptown Funk but I did not like the rest of the cd
0	I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.  If you don't have Metaphor or Glaciation they are master works, buy those instead.
0	This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.  There are no band credits on the sleeve but, for the record, they are Zappa, Ruth Underwood, Tom Fowler, Napoleon Murphy Brock, George Duke, and Chester Thompson. This era of Zappa/Mothers is very well covered elsewhere.  The second volume of YCDTOSA is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded. This one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table.
0	This CD only plays for a few seconds and then it pauses and starts over - each time it does the same thing.  I should have ordered the new CD I will never buy a used one again.
0	It seems every 4th or 5th song I get from the site cuts the ending of the song off. I'm quite puzzled.  Allan Boles
0	i like hammond organ, enjoyed sound of late Jon Lord' Hammond, but this album has too many different keyboards up front and guitars are burried behind. unfortunately, Steve Morse repeating himself  and his riffs and solos are too predictable. I love this band. one of the best live bands. enjoyed last album, but this one doesn't work for me
0	It's not the version I heard when I was little, slightly different and dissapointing
0	When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
0	You want to really hear what this song should sound like look up Alfie Boe.  He played JVJ in the O2 concert. Becky
0	As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a 'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.  If you're under 13 and female, you'll just love it. I saw Jewel in concert FOUR TIMES last year (2002).  If/when she tours this year (2003), I sure won't be in attendance.  I can't possibly be the only fan that feels cheated with the release of this CD.  How, in good conscience, can she record/release a CD like this?!?!  The fan base that she has diligently built over the years is in serious danger of ruin.  Speak out against this abominable CD.  I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE, I CAN'T BE ALONE ON THIS.
0	JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored 'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!  Both Joe Satch and Steve Vai are referenced heavily in JP's playing, (no bad thing, every guitar player is influenced by somebody), but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow.  As far as I am concerned, it is unimportant if a guitar player of JP's calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes, so long as a)he has something to say and b)he says it with his own voice. JP fails to achieve this here.  In summary: JP is awesome but fallible, he's only human after all.
0	"Arkansas" is the backside filler of 45 single Capitol 2494, "Where's The Playground, Susie" 1969 hit. The rest of the album is 1967-68 period album filler. For whatever inexplicable reason, Capitol took a photo from the REUNION THE SONGS OF JIMMY WEBB Lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue Lp series "new" release just before the RHINESTONE COWBOY, Capitol SW 11430 Lp release. Considering that GC's monster song at the time, "Rhinestone Cowboy" (Capitol 4095 45 single record) was roaring up the charts and that Capitol utterly dropped the ball and waited almost three months to put out the album with that title track, the label might've given the marketing wizards a green light to put out SOMETHING! ANYTHING! out to exploit that hole in his album releases at the time.
0	If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough. It was better than forcing myself to listen to Rap/Hip Hop though, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.
0	A little Keith sweat like. you do remember him.
0	What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.
0	I love the cd, the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that.
0	Wow.  I couldn't even make it through the whole thing.  Definitely not my cup of tea I guess.
0	My 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song. He goes crazy singing along when its on the radio or youtube. I was told the Pistol Annie's version was the clean one. Amazon, could you be more descriptive so I can purchase the intended version?
0	This sounds like two 12 year olds trying to imitate GNR.  Please don't ever butcher good songs by actually talented bands like gnr ever again.  You suck and this cover sucks.
0	If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement. But the music? O-H M-Y G-O-O-D-N-E-S-S! Who. made this stuff,since I could hardly call written. Sometimes I wonder what goes through rock critics (of all ages) minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker 'classic' on it. Okay first off Kurt Cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where I come from-I feel sorry for him. And his band (sorry) are so ametaurish it isn't even fresh or funny. Bands like U2 or The Clash were inexperienced at first but still made great,lively and powerful music from the beginning. But all this ends up is as an aural heroin 'daze'-the guitars are cloudy,Cobain's already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here "Something In The Way" still has no vital spark. To me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as Cobain wasted his talented (which may in fact exist) on forcing us to endure his inaudible,drug crazed 'wailing' of rants like "Terrestrail Pissings".And the acoustic "Polly"?Sounds like the worst garage band in the world. So why is 'Nevermind' called a masterpiece?Simple-Nirvana,despite fancying themselves anti establishment were (and still are)the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted PR campaign since the days of The Beatles. But there (again despite critics) is where the comparasin between Nirvana and The Beatles ends-for one "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is NOT a modern day "More Then A Feeling" and nothing Grohl,Cobain or the others do is anywhere close to Beatle-esque. Not only that (even if it's not Cobains fault) his music set a new record for rock n' roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and ALL of these records sound like 'Nevermind'.Also Cobains cynical and sad outlook,although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply. stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past. So this began the 'grunge generation' in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record?Technically very much?Should it be stripped from the market?NEVER,and that's the only reason why this should exist. Every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt-it's in the constitution. But also everyone has the right to their opinion so I felt compelled to get one. So if you subscribe to the grunge culture and don't have this you probably should,you'll love it. But if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble,lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear. But I had to hear it to have an opinion. My main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-I know others feel as I do. If Nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesn't always have to be a picture perfect one.
0	This is just  terrible song period. It's just bad. It really makes little sense. It was written to elicit a heart felt response, but instead you just roll your eyes and wonder how it managed to see the light of day.
0	This is a great song! I realize Miley is an artist and trying to express herself,but the video is disgusting,even tho the song is great.
0	I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!
0	Is not the same song on the movie.  This version is terrible even tho it's the original, I like the movie version way better.
0	I was expecting more from thisat  CD.  I pre-ordered it.  But, returned it once I listened. Yet, I expected more.  I am a fan of her music.
0	I tried to sleep while listing this tape, but it's more annoying than soothing. Some people may still like it, but I definitely did not enjoy it.
0	I think Hasselvander writes his own reviews.  This is not worth buying.  Painful to listen to.  Makes you want to give him lessons.
0	no windows phone support, last thing im buying until there is
0	So pathetic! Disappointed that Amazon sell this crap. I will not be purchasing ANYTHING till this is off of your site. I will also be sharing the hell out of this All OVER FACEBOOK!  For everyone that works for Amazon do us all a favor. Next time your in need of help DON'T call the Police!
0	Gah.  I was hoping for sermons. traditional "gospel" music.  Ugh.
0	Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.
0	Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.  Don't get me wrong!  I do love a lot of Van Halen's material, of both the Roth and Haggar eras.  But this is just not that great.
1	As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)
1	Lyrics and instrumentals are incredible. You can't listen to this on low. Crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing!
1	takes me back to when I was much younger. Good music
1	Nice version,  not your Grateful Dead  !
1	Great variety of songs with this album. Nice that the beauty of his music still lives on and is appreciated.
1	I have always loved this song, but did not have it on any device.  I loved playing it Christmas morning.
1	It's an mp3 download - product is exactly what was advertised.  Not much more to say about it, you either like him or you don't.
1	this album made me want to use this website less
1	Dont know if she will ever have another hit, but this was a great song and I love it!  Hope she continues her career with success.
1	I love this CD. I can't get enough E.S.Posthumus. I play it all the time
1	Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.
1	I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do". I like the "Healing Worship" too it makes me wish I was at his concert. I would definitely attend a William Murphy concert, because he definitely knows how to focus on the presence of God.  Well, anyway, I also like the song "Let it Rise". He has 3 good studio recorded contemporary gospel songs. My favorite is "I Don't Know Why" because I like neo-soul gospel and it was produced by PJ Morton. I like "Changes" and "All Day" too. I also like the song "Crazy Praise" which is a contemporary live song sung with Devaughn and DeJaughn Murphy. I hope they come out with an album, too.  William Murphy definitely can write some good songs. I can't wait for his next album. I heard he signed up with Sony. Hopefully, that'll be as good or better.
1	Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.
1	I like jazz & this is one of my favorite artists. It's clear & I think its just as good as hearing it on the cd. I recommend it
1	I purchased and rated it because it is a great song, I highly recommend it to those who like Country.
1	great harmony  super fourties  group
1	Love this song and the sound quality is great.
1	I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.
1	I love this song. The first time i heard it was at Radiate 2012 and was incredibly moved by it. Whether singing with a crowd or for praising God on your own this is a good buy.
1	Composer is included in the file information.  This is baroque so it's going to sound well, baroque.  Of course there are going to be some you aren't 100% thrilled with, but come on. it's $5 for all of them!
1	Just buy this. Trust me (says the random reviewer).  Like Awol Nation? You like Lorde? You don't like either of them? Well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny.
1	Good old oldy. Great sound and overall positive vibe. The world missed his sound. Gone too soon in my opinion.
1	happened to see her video of "rise up" on my facebook timeline. stunning. i went, listened to a few more songs, then got the cd. a breath of fresh air. she has a versatile and powerful voice. great lyrics, great melodies, and great instrumentation
1	Excellent choice of songs, very relaxing.  I have many soothing music CD's and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	I downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition.  I like downloading the .mp3's from Amazon - the process is easy.
1	Applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too. It's been stuck in my head since I heard it the first time. Looking forward to the full Artpop album and the music video.
1	Tom Scott continues his journey in music. Not only does his music continue  to amaze us but, we become part of his journey. Simply, amazing. This artist continues to be at the pinnacle of Jazz.  As an artist, he continues to evolve, thrive, and we are blessed by this.  Enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist.
1	I found this singer on My Space , so happy I did , All original songs ,fantastic swinging band ,takes you back to a very glamourous era, but still very today! love It!  I had the song" Happiest Day Of My Life" for my nieces wedding and people loved It!
1	I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	THIS ALBUM IS RARE FOR DEVOT PRINCE COLLECTOR I,M SO GLAD I OWN IT. THE TRACKS ARE VERY PRINCE JUST JAMMING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THE BAND. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR MORE COMMERCIAL PRINCE STUFF THIS IS NOT IT THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND YOURSELF HERE! BUY IT WHATEVER IT COST YOU!
1	This man is under R.Kelly as one of the best r n b male artists who can take all his songs and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyrics, beats, and esp. his appearance. You go r n b hard Tank!
1	I like the Dave Clark Five enough to want to have as many CDs by them as possible. I like all their songs they did in the 1960's.
