0	this is not the original it is a remake probably for some legal ownership reasons or some such bull. Complete crap. sorry i dowloaded it without listening first. i feel ripped off!
0	This album was pure 80's flop! Like so many artists of the previous decade M M was trying to go with the times,unfortunately that time was 1985 and music had changed so much that even a power house vocalist like Manchester had to succumb to survive. The songs on this album is what i would describe as Miami Vice[the series] Throwaways,nothing that will wow you,all except for one. JUST ONE LIFETIME is the sole,singular shinning moment on the album,Melissa lets loose on this big voice ballad reminisce of her "Don't cry out loud" years. To sum it all up,Melissa is better than this 1985 mess.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mathematics/dp/B00KUHR4EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mathematics</a>
0	ABC's "When Smokey Sings" is a gorgeous song no matter the version you end up with, just, this isn't the "single" version I really wanted.  Meh.  The apx. 4:22 version is much better, and this isn't it.
0	I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should... Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup. I don't think I should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is 1/10 of the original data in mp3 format. I would gladly pay an extra $5 dollars or whatever for wav handling, I don't think this is too much to ask. Amazon or Itunes can't seem to comprehend this.
0	Product came damaged and the vinyl was extremely warped, black smudges on the surface, and couldn't play at all. I am extremely disappointed considering the high price. Don't buy this.
0	Do not purchase this and support a band that includes a woman supporting a rapist. So ignorant-way to perpetuate rape culture...and you are a WOMAN!
0	I love the song, but I'll never use Amazon digital again!!! Waste of money and now I will have to find another way of buying this song.
0	This is Katy Perry's third and, unfortunately, awfully unimaginative album. I find myself skipping half of the tracks. They're boring, play-it-safe songs with a very rigid musical formula. I enjoy pop music that pushes the boundaries a little...this doesn't. At all.
0	Couldn't figure out how to download.
0	I didn't realize only 2 songs were on cd.  What a rip off.
0	Nothing but noise, don't waste you money. I'm a NIN fan but I was really pissed off.
0	It did not sound the original.
0	Strong political views that are ranted about through the media. Refuse to listen to it a second time.
0	I really liked Alternative album of their early b-sides through 1990 or so.  I thought this collection of b-side material would also be good but I was disappointed.  And PSB usually never disappoint me.  I only found 3 new tracks that I liked on the whole 2 cd set.  I already had How I Learned to Hate Rock & Roll, Delusions of Grandeur, and The View from Your Balcony.  The new tracks I liked were We're the Pet Shop Boys and Blue On Blue.  The other tracks are not very catchy & my attention wasn't kept long enough for me to judge the lyrics.  The songs are much more personal than what was on PBS Alternative so I can't relate to the songs.  Unless you are a big fan of Neil, I recommend downloading the above individual tracks from Amazon or iTunes.
0	This "song file" is just a single tone for tuning an instrument. DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you are needing to tune up your instrument.
0	I really love his voice but to much profanity. He uses racial slurs and seems aggressive. If he could for across clearer and get help with his aggression he might do well.
0	I haven't purchased this album, but I have listened to most of the songs on it on YouTube...and because I have respect for Russ and The Rippingtons, and they have given me years of musical enjoyment...I guess in the nicest way that I can put it, this new album just isn't my cup of tea.  It seems to lack energy and excitement, in my opinion. Plus, one the most uptempoed songs on the album,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/We-Made-A-New-World/dp/B008YE1NWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">We Made A New World</a>&nbsp;is very repetitive and it sounds like you're listening to the same notes and the same few beats throughout most of the entire song. Additionally, even the current single,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cougars-Gigolos/dp/B008YE1M9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cougars & Gigolos</a>, which is probably the best song the album is still not very outstanding and has a rather 'background' sound to it.  But all and all, I would say that the album as a whole is 'background' music...and I think that I'll stick to more interesting, fun, and exciting music such as Darren Rahn's latest album,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Speechless/dp/B000A2VAS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Speechless</a>. ;-)  ADDED ON 11/28/12 10:04PM PST: I would like to note that because of repeated radio play, I have come to like the song&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cougars-Gigolos/dp/B008YE1M9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cougars & Gigolos</a>...which seems to be the one song that I like on the album.
0	really?  this metrosexual probably wouldn't know how to collect eggs from a henhouse and these fat girls think he is country?  I mean really?  seriously?  and he IS NOT GOOD LOOKING!
0	I've been looking for the perfect white noise track to help my baby sleep, and stumbled upon this. It was the best reviewed noise track on amazon, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's not at all relaxing, and won't help a baby sleep. It's very harsh, and actually kept her awake.
0	The sample version of Staighten It Out is the more funky version that I remember hearing on the  radio, TV and at parties.  However, the version that I purchased and downloaded was a more jazzy version that I'm not familiar with and did not want.  Amazon did refunded me and stated that they would change the song available for purchase and download to match the sample song.  However, I went back to re-download the song and it is still the different version than the sample version.  After continuing my search,  I found the exact version of the song that I wanted on E Music via You Tube .
0	"I'm not sure how this purchase made it to my account I didn't download the product or ever listen to it"
0	So not the song I wanted.
0	Thank You
0	I was such a big fan of their debut album, I felt that Tantric would have a great second.  Which is why I decided to buy a cheaper copy off of Amazon rather then pay full price at BestBuy.  After really giving it sometime, the album feels forced and soul less.  Hey Now was the single that pulled me in but the problem with it lies within its very weak chorus.  The only good song on this album is Hero.  I think that Todd went into an area that didn't suit him nor the band.  One star for the song Hero. Don't waste your time on this album.  Enjoy their first album.
0	I wanted to upgrade the quality of this album from when I copied it from vinyl. The record was old and played a lot over the years. The download from Amazon was very poor. The sound seemed to travel from right to left and back and was not as high definition of my copy from the vinyl. The quality was not as good as my transfer from vinyl to digital. I will be asking for a refund.
0	Not as good as I thought it would be.material not there.
0	Roar is great, the rest is a bit boring. Some of it is just bad.......I tunes roar, save your money.
0	Working in the music industry I hear alot and see alot. For me to listen to this techno stuff is pretty bad considering its nothing but auto tune. The girl cant sing but her music is catchy. But to be honest, some songs on here are heavily autotuned to where you cant understand what shes tempting to sing. Not worth it.
0	Sounds like every other wanna be dance singer who tries to copy Brittney Spears or Christina Aguilera.  Even the auto tone can't help her.  I would not recommend this.  I'm giving it one star because I can't give zero stars.  Don't buy it.
0	2014 Forest Hills Drive is by far one of my favorite albums I've listened to and I reccomend the music to anyone. So because I loved the album, I decided to order a vinyl version to listen to on my record player. Got here very quickly and everything initially seemed great but when I played it, tracks started skipping to the point where you cannot listen to the vinyl as it repeats a verse over and over again and then skips straight to the chorus. I cleaned my record player and played other vinyls I have and none have the same problem. Very disappointed. Getting a replacement and hoping that it was just my copy that had the problem...
0	I expected the 3/5 star music content. The mostly instrumental arrangements actually made me more seriously consider purchasing this. The thing that finally made me bite was this being released in high def (24/96) fidelity and mixed in 5.1 surround sound. The 5.1 mix just sounds phoned in unfortunately. It honestly sounds for all the world like someone just did a cursory stereo mix and maybe expanded a couple stereo reverb programs to 5.1 programs. This is a very unadventurous stereo mix mastered to a surround format. That's it. It's professional quality. No distortions or anything. 24 bit and better than CD fidelity and all that. But lifeless. And this from the band that pretty much invented surround sound and brought it into people's homes with the quad release of Dark Side of the Moon.  This could have been a really good album too. If this would have been mixed with any hunger it could have been a very good 'back to their roots' experimental psyecedelic album with sounds in motion swirling around the room adding to the arrangements. Apparently no one cared.  It goes almost without saying that this is quite a bit better than Dave's last few albums (About Face, Momentary Lapse, Division Bell and On an Island) simply because it omits the very non-Pink Floyd sounding polite lyrics and commercial radio approach he's been into since the 1980's. Except for the last track (must be the radio cut). Avoid that one if you do decide to sit through this.
0	ONE GOOD SONG: LEAVING WINSLOW "Yeah Yeah": the most irritating song he's ever done. His SOLO ACOUSTIC records are among my all time fave live records. JB seems like a nice guy, with personality, but not here, that's for sure.
0	I love Alicia and this song in particular.  However, I'm confused why there's so much static in the song, especially at the beginning?  It doesn't appear to be there for effect.
0	I've held off on adding my "Fly From Here" review until I was able to say that I fully knew and understood every drop of this new Yes album. So I've given it 7 solid, serious, objective listens and the word that resonates the most is "disappointing".  Things definitely begin and end on high notes. I love the Overture. It's exciting and reveals themes that are used later on but never as well as during these first few minutes. Fly From Here Part 1 - We Can Fly has a lush melody and great momentum to it. And my favorite song on the album is probably the closing number Into The Storm, an upbeat, rhythmic number with a gorgeous and absolutely haunting middle section.  The rest of Fly From Here is either predictable, boring or just plain not very good. The song-structure and melodies are so basic and unimaginable. Steve Howe's solo pice Solitaire is decent enough but it feels out of place among this collection of songs. Same goes for Chris Squire's The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be which I might be able to justify on a solo project but certainly not in the middle of a Yes album. Life On A Film Set is ridiculously cheesy...if they sing the phrase "riding a tiger" one more time, I may be tempted to break something.  And Hour Of Need is harmless but more worthy of someone like Asia than Yes.  The centerpiece of the album is the 20+ minute Fly From Here suite which is once again, disappointing. As I said earlier, it starts off with lots of promise...I have no problem with it's first 8 minutes but it quickly turns lame and silly. While I wasn't expecting The Gates Of Delirium or The Revealing Sciences of God, something a little more challenging and intricate would have been welcomed.  I know that so many of the comments about this new chapter of Yes are centered around Jon Anderson no longer being in the band and sure, I'd rather Jon was here and am not at all happy about the way his legendary time with Yes came to an end. But I actually like Benoit David's vocal work on Fly From Here --- he somehow makes it his own and most of what he's doing works nicely. I just don't think that Geoff Downes' keyboard style is suited for Yes music. He brings a Mannheim Steamroller kind of quality to the sound which might work in limited doses but over the course of a whole album I don't think he comes anywhere close to the many keyboard-players who passed through Yes over the years.  I was definitely expecting a lot more from this effort and am surprised at just how mediocre it is. I've heard some refer to Fly From Here as Drama, Part 2 but I loved Drama which was dynamic and original and this one doesn't come anywhere within miles of approaching that level. Two stars out of 5.
0	This version is like Pat Boone remade this classic hit years after it's original release. You can definitely tell the difference. Avoid.
0	Purchased this song but Amazon will not let me download it if I could give it 0 stars I would.
0	I tried to purchase this song on the Amazon App for BlackBerry but instead of getting this one song the app tried to get me to download the whole album. Now I'm trying to figure out how to get a refund. Love the song but the technology could be better.
0	Love the song but I CAN'T GET IT TO DOWNLOAD ON TO MY PHONE!!!  SO FRUSTRATING.. I tried deleting it and adding again.. It's probably the Amazon Ap itself because it downloaded on to my computer
0	IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE SONGS ARE STILL IN THE SYSTEM AND I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM AGAIN...I DID NOT RECEIVE ON MY IPOD.....
0	They cant all be gems.
0	The album is ok. I wasn't super impressed. The best songs don't sound like any of his previous stuff, and the ones that do are terrible.
0	Everyone I know has been ranting and raving about Sam Smith lately,I agree he can sing, but I don't find anything special about him. Don't waste your money on this EP.
0	We all know Roar sold thanks to Nokia and Pepsi, the song can be catchy, boring and similar to Brave. It's a VERY generic album, you can find no iconic song here. We all know Katy put her heart into this, but her producers are the most generics you can find in the industry. The album is FULL of fillers, you fall asleep when Ghost begins... Never wake up.
0	Not the instrumental I thought it was. Not the instrumental I thought it was. Need I say it one more time?
0	I bought this in August, but the version I received was the standard one, not the Limited Edition. Once I came back to Brazil, I couldn't change it or send it back in time. S***ty deal.
0	How can I describe infinity and beauty combined? Not at all, and that's the essence of play and childhood doings contained here in SONG OF SEVEN  - One centimeter of this work of Jon Anderson's cannot be taken away and analyzed, in my humble opinion. This is why generations pass knowledge on, perhaps. SO7 is simply beyond this rating system. I leave it at that.
0	K. Zirkle's review of this CD is freakishly similar to mine, so I don't feel that I need to really say much more. Primer is without a doubt my favorite Rockapella CD of all time.  I got my copy signed by the group at one of Sean's last performances. All of my U.S CD's have been purchased on release day with the exception of Bang. After hearing some of the preview tracks on the website, it was clear that the streak would end. I only recently purchased this CD for the collector in me, so I could have every RP CD (Japan, and U.S, and all compilations).  Although a couple songs are decent, my favorite is California Sad-Eyed Girl (I was at the concert they premiered it at), many seem to be lacking something (aside from the dreaded auto-tune) that made Rockapella my favorite group.
0	Yeah you can only imagine because it's BS. Christian crap has no place in my playlist nor should it even be recommended to me
0	This is a review of the Vinyl Record that was put out in the end of 2014.  I was excited to see this and upon opening my package I was hit right away that the cover looked "off" and not as detailed. I took it over to my cover from the 80's and put them side by side to see how they looked. The rerelease is way washed out compared to the original. The muscle structure on Eddie is a soft pink instead of a darker red and the detail lines are soft. The only part that looks better is aroundthe moon. The rest looks faded by 30-50% (I am not a graphic artist complaining about a 5% difference, this is pretty major)  I no that sometimes there can be master issues but the difference in quality is way more than I would expect it to be even if they had to scan and remake an original (which I doubt since Steve is so on making sure Maiden property is protected).  So love the songs, but if you want to get the 2014 rerelease vinyl thinking this epic cover would be as stunning as the original than you are in fore disappointment.  Since I bought this to display in my office I am sad to see the quality failed, hence 1 star on something that should have been easy to accomplish.

0	I like everything Bob does.  This is great song
1	Very good
1	I love the blend of different songs. It very easy to listening to. I can sit, relax, and enjoy the sound and environment without feeling overwhelmed.
1	Good old song from the days.
1	Great song.  Easy download.
1	Great Music. Energetic. Creative. Magical. Meaningful. Fashion Art Music.
1	Song of the year
1	Timeless truth.  This is a song that no matter how old or young you are will bring tears to your eyes.  The picture these words paint are truths we as His children understand.  I pray for those who have never come to see their sin like Mary who poured out her praise on Him  like oil from her Alabaster box.
1	WELL THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND HANGING OUT IN COMPTON CAILF. AND IT ALSO SHOWS BACK WHEN PEOPLE WANTED TO GET TOGETHER AND HAVE PLAIN OLD FUN. EVEN IF THE WOMAN IN THE SONG WANTS A MAN WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF HER AND HIMSELF. ANYWAY THE SONG IS ABOUT GOOD OLD FASHION FUN. THERE IS NOT SHOOTING AND CALLING EACH OTHER OUT OF THEIR NAMES. IT'S JUST A LOVE STORY. YES I WOULD TELL SOMEONE TRY IT OUT.
1	one of my favorite movie score tracks ever!
1	THIS GROUP OF YOUNG MEN ARE THE BEST......THEY SING AND LOOK LIKE ANGLES FROM HEAVEN.
1	Very good album.
1	Love this song, but it has depressing overtones.
1	Played it all the way thru, only thing was that I wanted more. Love you can take my life and the video!
1	Very good.  Not just the AM radio hits.  SOme very cool covers
1	love the music
1	kept me dancing all day. Excellent to exercise to. Shared the information to all my senior friends. They purchased and now we all walk to it.
1	The Fixx demonstrated a tremendous talent with Reach the Beach. It contains the hits One Thing Leads to Another and Saved By Zero. The album itself was a commercial success, containing a lineup of songs that were appealing and fun to listen to. I would recommend this album to anyone as an introduction to a great band that I feel is under sung.
1	The Sonics are one of the greatest "unknown" American rock bands of the 1960s.  They rocked harder than anybody and singer Gerry Roslie was one of the all-time great screamers.  While they never had any national success, they were a big influence on punk rock.  This CD contains most of the best material that they recorded for Etiquette Records, except for their Christmas music.  There is also a radio ad for a Sonics concert and an interview with bass player Andy Parypa.  The interview isn't really something most people will want to listen to more than once, and the CD would have been better off including more songs instead.  Here is the complete track listing:  1. The Witch  2. Do You Love Me  3. Boss Hoss  4. Dirty Robber  5. Have Love Will Travel  6. Psycho  7. Money  8. Walkin' the Dog  9. Night Time is the Right Time  10. Strychnine  11. Good Golly Miss Molly  12. The Hustler  13. Psycho (live)  14. Cinderella  15. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark  16. Skinny Minnie  17. Jenny Jenny  18. He's Waitin'  19. Louie Louie  20. Hitch Hike  21. Shot Down  22. Keep A Knockin'  23. The Witch (live)  24. The Witch (alternate take)  25. Sonics concert radio advertisement  26. Interview with Andy Parypa
1	I have to admit that I know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre, but in my opinion this is the best one since Britney Spears' cover of Madonna's cover of Marilyn Monroe covering "Happy Birthday" for JFK. It's even above that "Silent Night" one that was re-covered one hundred and eighty times by Nashville artists alone! I know how proud and happy Glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posteriors through song.
1	This was my first time of knowing the name Ce'cile and of her music. Although, I am not mush a music reviewew but, listening to music by Ce'cile was uplifting and exccelarating. I first thught i was listening to Lady Saw then i discovered this is a brand new spitfire to listen to. Ce'cile's music is super good to listen to and enjoy. I love the lyrics.
1	Excellent singer
1	Love the lyrics and the beat.....find myself humming it
1	I love this song! It's very funny and I loved seeing it live. I love Glinda and Elphaba! I would totally buy it if your having any second thoughts!
1	Awesome song for the movie . Lana Del Rey is the perfect person for the song. Loved the original and love this one more!
1	I had this album back in the '70s and lost it. I've looking for another copy for the longest, i wished that it had been on a cd, but i can change that. this is a great album, some of bill withers best work in my opinion. its full of life's experiences and observations. i'm glad i was able to locate another copy. for anyone who loves bill withers and is collecting his music, this is a "got to have" piece of work, take my word for it....
1	Good song
1	Bought this for my daughter well my wife wanted it too lol but its great. It has all the best songs would buy again
1	delicate convicting soulful
1	Teddy Bears, Picnics, Fear, combine in wonderful melange.
1	Nice throwback
1	awesome album
1	I was out running when I hear this cd and knew I had to get it, a great cd must have
1	Great song.
1	Obsessed with this album and especially "Gravity" with Maria Brink. Papa Roach always mutates into new sounds with every album and they never fail while doing so. Love these guys, love this album.
1	It turns out the old saying is true: The family that plays together, stays together. Four siblings and their best pal make up indiepop group Eisley, whose debut EPs hinted at what they could do. And "Room Noises" certainly proves that their airy, whimsical pop was worth the long wait for.  Some of the songs are from those EPs, although they sound a bit tighter and smoother. For example, the heartbreaking ode to the bullied, "Telescope Eyes," or the prettily whimsical "Marvelous Things." Despite the airy poesy of the songs, there's a distinctly melancholy streak through the album, which peaks at the very beginning: "Memories," a haunting song about a woman mourning her husband's suicide.  Despite a few EP songs, they also have quite a few new songs, like the enchantingly sunny "Golly Sandra," which has echoes of the Beach Boys. But the sparkling pop vibe continues in other songs, carried over in piano melodies and smooth guitar riffs. "Still floating soft/I am dreaming and I'm glad I lost/And still with my fingers/I'm drawing circles in the water," the song goes, as fluid as the water it talks about.  That mixture of bittersweetness and innocent optimism is what makes Eisley so darn appealing. Nowhere are the stereotypical I-just-wanna-have-fun or my-boy/girlfriend-dumped-me-and-now-I-wanna-swim-with-the-toaster music for THIS pop band. While they have some love songs, the emphasis is on their enchanting kind of whimsy.  That whimsy carries over into just about whatever they sing about, whether it's Sherri and Staci singing about dragons in the woods, sunlight and butterflies, or metal teeth and "telescope eyes." Some of the lyrics seem to stray into Flaming Lips-type surrealism, but are also grounded by simple sentiments like, "You have shining eyes, yes like those forest lights, and it makes me want to cry."  After the past few years, with the group rapidly moving out of the teen bracket, one would wonder if Stacy and Sherri Dupree's angelic vocals would have gotten... well, not so pretty. No problem with that -- they sound a bit like younger versions of Beth Gibbons or perhaps Hope Sandoval. The two girls even interplay their vocals in on song, with remarkable skill and spine-tingling results.  At the start of one song, the line "Congratulations, we've finally made it" is sung. And so Eisley has -- and this promising band only shows signs of getting even better in albums to come.
1	GREAT ALBUM GREAT SINGER
1	Sounds are as good as the series.
1	classic LOVE SONG OF ALL TIME.
1	I had this song previously on my computer but when I had to re-install windows i lost all my music.
1	It is so difficult to get good international music in the states in the mall record stores.  I am so thankful that Amazon offers me access to such great titles as Marque, the French rap group Manau and Anastacia's newest CD, as well as Angelique Kidjo, to name a few.  The problem about having lived in so many different countries is that you get spoiled and want the music you like, even in the U.S.  I was happy to find Marque on here, because I had downloaded his hit "One to Make Her Happy" when I was in Germany, but now that I'm in the U.S. again, my PC won't let me access it.  Thank goodness for Amazon and its global reach.
1	I love the CD!! Neil Byrne's voice is so smooth,  so beautiful.  The songs have a jazzy feel and if you love him in Celtic Thunder, you will most certainly enjoy this.
1	Another great song from Band Perry! Cant go wrong with any of their music
1	I love Phantogram and Big Boi glad they came together
1	I really like the song when I first heard it on Youtube but I wanted the 2005 version. It's a better version. However that doesn't mean that I did not like the Disc I am enjoying it so much that I can't thank them for the sale of the disc. Thanks  NICOLAS SEBASTIAN MASSU DE LA CARRERA
1	Love this song
1	What can I say, back than the song's had much meaning, and bring back so many memories. I just love old school, always have always will.   ( SOME POLPE LISTEN TO REMEMBER, AND SOME TO FORGET )   AN ALL TIME GREAT !!!!!
1	Song makes you want dive deeper into personal gloom and is a great addition to a moody soundtrack,
1	I love this C.D. it is ten times better than believe. If you like to boogie woogie than by this C.D.My favorit Songs are in this order *Love is a lonely place without you *song for the lonely *The music's no good without you *when you walk away *Aive again *when the money's gone *Love so high *rain,rain *body to body, heart to heart *REal love *love one another
1	thanks
