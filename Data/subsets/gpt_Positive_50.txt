Amazon review: "In comparison to other mashups that I have heard, this is mediocre at best.  In general I find mashups to be very fun to listen to -- there's a huge variety of interesting rock and hip-hop samples in Feed the Animals... the problem is that they are jammed together unimaginatively and without much artistry.  A great comparison would be to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/As-Heard-on-Radio-Soulwax-Pt-2/dp/B0000636KJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2</a>, and the other radio soulwax compilations by 2 Many DJs.  Feed the Animals actually uses a lot of the exact same samples and artists, though Girl Talk is much more rap/hip-hop heavy, whereas radio soulwax tends more towards sampling other electronic music and pop.  A majority (but not all) of the transitions on this album are rather abrupt with hard boundaries -- it'll go beat-beat-switch, oh now I'm listening to something entirely different with no tie-in to what I was just hearing other than it has the same tempo.  In comparison, 2 Many DJs tend to creatively blend and layer the tracks into each other, and sometimes reintroduce sounds from 2 or 3 tracks ago to tie it all together.  In summary, this album has a scattering of enjoyable combinations, but they are very brief, end abruptly, and are mixed into the middle of long tracks.  It would have been better to divide this album up into 30 or 40 tracks so that we could excise the small clips that actually work -- the album doesn't play as a cohesive composition anyway."

Amazon review: "I don't like this guy's music very much but it's good to see African Americans with Down Syndrome making the jump into entertainment.  This guy could be the Chris Burke of the Afro-American movement.  Keep up the good work, buddy!  We are all very proud of you!"

Amazon review: "What is this?  This album is too overated just because of Cobain's passing.  I guess it has a few good songs on it, definately not a great grunge album.  This guy can't sing or play guitar!  And it turns out that Dave Grohl, the drummer, is the talented one in the band after starting his own (Foo Fighters).  If you want a good grunge album, get Stone Temple Pilots Purple or even Core...."

Amazon review: "I am a huge Down fan and their first 2 cd's are classics.  Down 3 had mediocre soundwriting and Phil's vocal chords were shot, much like Brian Johnson's have been in AC/DC since Thunderstruck.  Still, I ran out yesterday and bought the Down IV cd...but something was wrong.  The engineering and mixing were so bad and the volume so low, I actually returned it to the store thinking the cd itself was defective and got a replacement!  To my surprise it was not the cd, but the horrible engineering, mixing and production job done on this EP.  I'm used to sludge mixing with bands like The Sword and High On Fire, but this is ridiculous.  I've heard better audio from local bands demo cd's.  The guitars sound like they were recorded 500 yards away from the studio and you cannot make out a single actual bass guitar note, just an occasional added thump of a low E accompanying the murky drums (you can hear snare and bass drum, still can't hear a tom tom at all).  I get that Phil and the guys want to have a jam feel like Kyuss and early Queens of the Stone Age, but actually go back and listen to those bands and you can hear they were trying for the best production values they could afford.  Phil and Pepper spent $10 on this recording...and got robbed of $9.00!!!  The whole cd sounds like it was engineered with a Mute button accidentally on during the recording.  My car stereo has decent thump to it, but this cd had to be cranked to twice the normal volume just to hear it.  Literally it sounds like your friends' band setup a 1980's tape recorder in the corner of their garage and pressed Record while they practiced.  Yes Lamb of God has the big budget and can afford a producer like Machine, but even Amon Amarth, who will never have the $$$ Phil Anselmo does, can afford a modern, clear sounding record where every instrument can be heard.  I own 3 Down shirts, every cd (no pirating), and am about to see Down for the third time in concert this Monday night...but Mr. Anselmo, you really should refund the $7.99 I paid for this.  There are good songs buried on this cd, but good luck trying to resurrect them from the worst mixing job in music history."
