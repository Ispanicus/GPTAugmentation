0	This is not the original Dukes of Dixieland which was popular in the 1950's. In fact, the original Dukes had some of the earliers stereo recordings ever made.
.	I think this group could have a good sound and I like their songs. However, this album's SOUND QUALITY is TERRIBLE. The songs are great, but the entire album sounds like it has been mastered so loud, that everything, except the quiet melody's in songs are distorted. I gave the album two starts because I like the groups music, but for me, on a very good stereo, it's almost hard to listen to because everything is so distorted. Buy the cd if you want to support the group, but it almost sounds better to listen to on bad laptop speakers, because then you don't hear as bad how distorted it is
0	I have the worst copy of that song ever made- lousy!
0	I will not marry you, woman!  it's rude to keep asking.
0	Seeing that this IS the anniversary, who out there will compile a concise dvd (2 hrs.) portraying the exact replica of this far-flung disc containing all of its audio and even video images? Maybe some proceeds can go to helping fund NASA ? 
.	Despite the inexplicable praise they have recieved from rock critics and the media, I have no problem voicing my sincere hatred and utter loathing for the Seattle grunge band Nirvana.  Whoever unlocked a studio door and handed a recording contract to these talentless @sses should be held accountable for the nu metal fad most rock radio listeners had to endure as the 1990s came to a close. Nirvana were nothing more than a record company's marketing ploy
0	Never order this, I don't know this alvun
0	This CD was a complete disappointment for me. I bought it for a remastered redbook version of "Paradise Theater" since the Styx titles are in desperate need. The 2004 Anthology package is far-better mastered than this edition.  I can't speak to the SACD, but AVOID if you want 2014-quality redbook remastering. This is as-bad as any first-generation CD.
0	Got the CD today, love Ed Sheeran, but information on what songs are on CD is wrong. I was really excited for the song all the stars but instead I got a CD with the song make it rain. I could have gotten the exact same CD way cheaper on eBay if I wanted the CD I got, but I bought this one for one of my favorite songs by him. Maybe its time to check your informatin.
0	It doesn't quite have the gravitas needed for heavy lifting, nor does it have the upbeat tempo for cardio. Milktoast is how I would describe it.
0	I love Sara Groves.  Her lyrics and music usually really speak to me but this album just didn't click with me.  I just seemed very different, not as lyrical as her others.  Maybe it is just me but I would recommend one of her others like, "The Other Side of Something" over this one.
0	Not my thing. downloaded for a friend
0	Ok CD.  A few good songs but not worth the buy.  Obviously there is better bands out there but if you want "rock" music you can listen to with your pop friends, this will work
0	First two albums were absolutely phenomenal. Unfortunately, "The World Is My Enemy Now" was complete crap. They went from heavy southern metal with major influences from Pantera to this emo screamo pansy bullshiz. SO disappointed. Bring back the Texas Blood Money guys!
.	I listened to the sample online and it sounded fine. I paid for the song and downloaded it and, on the exact same computer and speakers, the thing sounds horrible. It's like I got a really cheap and crummy recording rather than the one I heard online. The song I got is fuzzy and lousy.  If this was a regular product rather than something I can't return you can bet I'd return it in a heartbeat. I've never had a problem with Amazon before but then I've never downloaded a music file from them before
0	I refuse to contribute to a woman hater. Its his sexist remarks such as calling people "little girls" that has left a bad taste in my mouth and quite frankly what am I suppose to tell my female friends if they see me with this material by Joe Derosa?
?	Oh heck. Only after buying this CD, and before listening to it, did I realize that I had it already; only I had put it, some time ago, in the "to go" bin and completely forgotten about it. I guess that gave me the chance to double-check. I've enjoyed the recordings of the Balanescu Quartet, not only of other composers (among which my favorite is the String Quartets of Kevin Volans,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/String-Quartets-2-3/dp/B000004CW3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt
!	I was hoping this was the U.S. release version that doesn't have the woman's voice talking at the beginning of the song. It would've been nice if the 30 second sample was at the beginning so people who prefer the U.S. version, as opposed to the U.K. version, can avoid making the mistake of purchasing this song. Also, according to Wikipedia the U.K. version's song title should be the reverse: (Birds Fly) Whisper to a Scream. Please fix this Amazon
.	I love this album, unfortunately the quality for the Vinyl was really low. I just started collecting them so I don't have that meany to go off of but this Vinyl is the worst one I own. The sound is really bad when compared to the other more high quality vinyls I have, it has a scratchy sound other bad noticeable imperfection.  That being said this is my second favor album (I just listen to it the MP3) and it might just have been this one bad recording
0	If you're going to keep out the explicit lyrics, there's no need to half-spell them in the lyrics shown. My 9 year old was really disappointed in the senseless cussing.
0	I would be more bothered if this performance had any life in it.  Instead it's like listening to the march of the pachyderms.  This pianist decided he could re-write the Moonlight Sonata, but it comes off sounding more like he mis-read the sheet music.  His small changes add nothing, and serve mainly to raise eyebrows.  Find a better performance, there are plenty out there.
0	When I grabbed this one for a buck at Goodwill, I thought it was Sons of the Pioneers, but it's still good music.  Side 1 1. Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie 2. The Old Chisholm Trail 3. Red River Valley 4. Whoopie Ti Yi Yo 5. Doney Gal 6. Tumbling Tumbleweeds 7. Poor Lonesome Cowboy Side 2 8. Colorado Trail 9. I Ride Old Paint 10. Night Herding Song 11. Cool Water 12. Streets of Laredo 13. Home on the Range
0	When the CD arrived the cover said Bobby Sherman. I had to call Amazon and they told me to open it. Inside was the Cracklinf Fire CD. HUH? Don't buy this. Even cranked up as load as it would go you could barely hear it. Don't waste your money.
0	The wife loves this song, I don't. YMMV.
0	as others have said - great album, but should've included a download code
0	Absolutely horrible. Ugly music. Shockingly bad. Had been very excited to hear. Listened first time with three other music aficionados. All simply disgusted by it! Shocked this got made and anyone has recommended it. First time ever I purchased an LP with regrets. Rarely write reviews, but wish to save others the pain we experienced hearing this.
0	yes I said unusual very strange he could be doing som ething better then this I give this CD a/2 if I had that kind of talent on guitar you'd be writing a review about me
0	I was not able to download this song but was still charged for the purchase.  This has happened once before.  Not sure what the problem is Amazon?
0	The disc was flawed & inoperable on my Bose equipment. Unfortunately I traveled & missed the return deadline.
0	It is ok just not the same with out Sammy Hagger
0	First off, do not be fooled.  This is not an album it is a mixtape.  Bernard buddens was axed from all major labels after his poor selling debut album.  As a result, he tried to pass this offas an album.  Cant fool me.  Not 1 song is listenable.  His voice is altered via machine.  No cohesiveness.  boring, bland.
0	Lol this sounds like the gay sounding song James Taylor never wrote. Horrible, formulaic dung destined for the elevators and easy listening country pop FM stations of today. 
.	I bought this because the preview sounded really nice and relaxing. I have been looking for a good soundtrack to my yoga routine to change things up a bit. However, when I was listening to it, there are a few 'mini-songs' that are anything but relaxing. It sounds like an amateur with keyboard playing around with the built-in features. The worst parts really ruin the nicer bits. Especially around 10:30 the music is so awful my yoga-mate and I were laughing
0	I got this included with another purchase. It's about as exciting as watching mud dry! Just not my taste. Sure some people might enjoy it.
0	I usually love all of her songs. I just can't understand what happened to her fun, energetic, & carefree style.
0	This song becomes more and more depressing as time goes along so I deleted it.
0	I bought this mp3 file and it quit working due too copyright issues
0	This probably is NOT the recording of this much praised song that you want - go to the album "I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight" and try the song there first.  I think I mis-bought this version first and could not understand why it was so often mentioned as among Richard and Linda's best.  Just saying.
.	Should you buy this?  Well, if you're the old me, who had money to burn, who drove to Omaha from Seattle in the dead of winter to watch Mayer from my second row seat, who flew cross-country to hear Mayer mesmerize at the Chastain in Atlanta, and who attended every local concert he's performed, then absolutely. What's 20 bucks?  But if you're the recent me, who lost that life, and now gets the latest Mayer music three years after its release from the local library, then no
.	I am a representative of J. H. Christ, CEO of Divine Justice ltd, you may even say God's representative on Earth. Divine Justice has released a press release on this piece of media and all other memorabilia of The Gospel.  "For many years, more than I care to broadcast, our company has overseen the product of Earth and regularly released all kinds of propaganda through our smaller company P.O.P.E ltd (Pentateuch Organisation for Propaganda on Earth)
0	irritating and produced the opposite of a relaxing mood. very disappointed.
0	I love Christmas music of all genres.  From TSO to the Pogues and the Pretenders, to SheDaisy and Willie Nelson to RUN DMC to Bing Crosby and Tony Bennett, and just about anything and everything between.  This was just garbage in my opinion.  I don't find it "offensive" per se, but it's hardly something I would add to my very large Christmas collection.  It was quite annoying.
1	I bought this for my friend Peter Greco (who by the way is on RRIME on Amazon). he is a little older than I am so he really likes the music and the artist and the hits of the fabulous 50's and you can get all those great hits on the Musical Collect YOUR HIT PARADE.
1	There one of the best groups in the world and what I and my family have grown up on so I would definetly recommend to friends.
1	Best song I've heard in a long long time! Great meaning, great lyrics! It's my number one song right now! 
.	This recording is one of the closest to a live performance I've ever heard.  Its a must for anyone with curiosity - you don't have to like Janacek, string quartets or even classical music to hear the guts in the performance and sheer conviction.  A long time fan of the Lindsays', I heard them play these pieces live in London many years ago at one of the most emotive concerts I've ever been to.  The recording takes you on a similar ride - the music is visceral and the playing totally convincing
1	One of my favorites couldn't pass up then chance when I found it, priced reasonable great buy.
1	Grew up listening to willie and would travel to see / hear him, bought more online on other cd's, good stuff
1	The first time i ever heard of Lana Del Rey through my own self, was listening to "Video Games" on a different radio statio- who listens to the radio anymore, right? Lol So anyway, i loved this song so much that as soon as i could get to a computer and download this song, i did just that! I never buy things on impulse, but i knew that if i didn't buy it, i would constantly think of that song. I am very pleased with my purchase :)
1	A favorite from back then still holds up- nice walk down memory lane and great music, too. Would recommend this song.
1	This album is amazing! Eminem has a skill with words that no one will ever be able to match. The song "RapGod" shows complete evidence of how amazing his skills are, absolutely super sonic! only have a few songs i skip, which is the opposite of most peoples albums now days where theres only a few good songs to listen to.
1	If you love your music to have meaning. THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU!. point blank, I useda think J. Cole was the best "new" rapper, I WAS WRONG! Kendrick Lamar is on a whole different platform. highlights of the album for me are: Rigamortis, A.D.H.D., Hol' Up, The Spiteful Chant, HiiiPower, Ronald Reagan Era. and I could go on because this album has NO filler. BEST HIP-HOP ALBUM OF '11 hands down! 
1	Love this CD.  The songs are beautiful.  I think the duet with Carrie Underwood may be my fav.  What else can I say?  Willie never disappoints.
1	My daughter's loved this as do my grandsons. of course - I'm the biggest fan. brings back memories - of childhood and all those fun things.
1	There is nothing that sucks about this album- except it is too short. If you like metal, you'll like this bad lad. The songs are awesome, the production is awesome, there's nothing bad about it, in my mind.  Just buy it.
1	Thank you Prince for releasing this on CD Only on 4/29/16~ leaving Amazon MP3 Players in the purple dust
1	As country music continues its downward spiral towards lack of identity, Lori Smith shines through with a voice that captures the true, honest, and heart rending emotion that lovers of traditional country music have yearned for. Download a sample and experience country music sung as it was supposed to be performed. Ms. Smith is a hit away from stardom.
1	He is his mothers son in the song department.  I loved the d
1	This album is one hit after another. I hope country radio plays it because I think it's as good or better than anything out there.
1	It became one of my instant favourite songs, because it speaks to me on multiple levels
1	This is an inspiration to me. It is real music. What I like about it is that it's not just a song where the artist is just trying to get popularity. It is genuine straight from the heart truth and I love it.
1	This is another version of my favorite from Song to the Moon. It is really good, but not a great favorite of mine. I liked other versions better.
1	i love this song and i love the way she sings it and i love her voice. great in the movie
1	The offspring deliver amazing instrumentals with equally great lyrics
1	A good as I remember it sounding. Excellent. Instant delivery, I was listening to it just a few minutes after I purchased it. 
1	One of the more unique Bond opening songs in my opinion. This song sets the tone for  the entire movie. I am happy to have the full length version
1	It's refreshing to see such entertainment as this. Cray Button wins five stars for fun, great music, great beat, bringing in Lecrae, and kicking stress out!
1	I have never heard such a good version of this song.  I highly recommend purchasing and sharing with everyone you know.
1	This artist delivers an amazing song this is not a knock off! I cant wait to see what more they have to offer
1	Cool stuff.  This was a free tune the other day and it has definitely been worth the listen. I'll be grabbing more stuff from this musician for sure.
1	Yeah, if there were more great indies sellin music, and actually gettin sales, this economy would start to rule! Keep up the great work. I do be "broke" at the minute, but I'll keep this in mind. Its great when you create!
1	Neal Fox has created an inspiring ballad here.  I may disagree with his idea that society declined in the last 40 years or so as some note society declined starting at the turn of the century, yet I love the sentiment behind the song!  A winner!
1	perfect balanced rapper.  Street, smooth, conscious, with enough trend to stay in mainstream.
1	I love the song.  I came upon it having watched "Luther".  Hope Sandoval on vocals just makes it amazing.
1	Ryuichi Sakamoto shows his deep inner self on solo piano, but be ready for pensive, introspective & sometimes brooding moments that truly touch the depths of human emotion.  This is one example of his exploration of those depths.  He's one of a kind.
1	Kem sings about love, a universal subject. Some of his songs are spiritual, which is terrific. His lyrics are intellectual. Kem is a very talented musician. He sings about letting things happen in their own time, missing your lover, wanting to be with your lover, cherishing moments, finding peace, and so on. It's a mixture of jazz and r&b/soul. I highly recommend this album to everyone.
1	When I was in the U.S. Submarine force in the 70's Sweet Thing was played in the Enlisted Club a lot, and it brings back a lot of great memories.
1	one of the greatest blues acoustic guitarist and 1 of the greatest blues voices to stick boy sees much to shout about here get your hands clapping and your feet a tappin' gotta have it
1	Glad to be able to get it digital.  Brings back good memories,  I missed hearing the song and will enjoy it.
