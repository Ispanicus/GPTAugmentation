Amazon review: "It's impossible to believe that this piece of crap comes from the guy who put out 'La Sexorcisto Devil Music Vol. 1' as part of the group White Zombie.  'Foxy Foxy' is a pop song trying to masquerade as some type of heavy metal, but it fails at both. It's Top 40 longings are ruined because it tries to be heavy, and it's heavy metal attempts are ruined because of it's suary sick drums, repetition, and general formulaic lameness.  This song is such a piece of garbage that it actually makes me angry when I hear it. In fact, it makes me almost as angry as The Worst Song Ever Created, 'Boom Boom Pow'. Both are pop music garbage.  Come on, Rob Zombie, find out where you lost your balls and have them reattached."

Amazon review: "This file is damaged, it has skips and pops all through it, artifacts I don't expect with digital.  It's too bad, I love this song. Save your money, it's not listenable."
