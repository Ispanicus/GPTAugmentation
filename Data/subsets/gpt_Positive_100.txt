Amazon review: "WELL THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND HANGING OUT IN COMPTON CAILF. AND IT ALSO SHOWS BACK WHEN PEOPLE WANTED TO GET TOGETHER AND HAVE PLAIN OLD FUN. EVEN IF THE WOMAN IN THE SONG WANTS A MAN WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF HER AND HIMSELF. ANYWAY THE SONG IS ABOUT GOOD OLD FASHION FUN. THERE IS NOT SHOOTING AND CALLING EACH OTHER OUT OF THEIR NAMES. IT'S JUST A LOVE STORY. YES I WOULD TELL SOMEONE TRY IT OUT."
