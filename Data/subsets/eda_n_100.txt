cause it by their own conclusion the liner notation rendering of the high german auf eigene faustus here is i sort of fear that they have ofttimes head for the hills from their own master copy this is pointless but i habit let myself be dog away so i stay there and i tone good i see myself nigh as a gardener percentage guardian and percentage divine of pretty affair in the melodic nirvana that belongs to all of us so this is medicine for those who equate nirvana and soupy motion picture show medicine delaware gustibus but im afraid its not the blossom of nirvana that pelecis is horticulture

belgian megadisc classics really that i bought the cd launched in megadisc did great service by bringing to the attention of music lovers a whole array of composers from the by then ex soviet empire

music of shostakovichs maverick student galina ustvolskaya and if only for that it deserves eternal gratitude and in truth i had forgotten about the pelecis being featured on the competing teldec disc but by an extraordinary coincidence it was brought back to my memory by a comment posted under my none too enthusiastic review there exactly when i had pulled this one out of my shelves to listen to it but still with all that i didnt expect pelecis to write the same kind of music as michael nyman or philip glass repetitive fresh propulsive jubilant yet its what he does in revelation also tonal easy sounding almost like joyous rap music or like music for a kids choir something like pelecis version of the little sweep the music could easily pass for absolutely corny but it is so unabashedly so that i feel like a perverse attraction to it and i like the music of nyman also sometimes i like also what sounds to me as a total contradiction between the mood of the music jubilant and facile music for your kids show at the end of the year of elementary school and what the piece is about in the composers own words revelation presents three soloists a countertenor a pianist and a trumpet player refusing to accept the familiar dreadful prophesies preferring the promises of a realm of light and joy in the new jerusalem the theme is divided into three parts the last lines of he revelation of saint john gloria in exelsis deo and hallelujah in paradise do i read a subtext here pelecis talking about his refusal of ugly contemporary music preferring the promises of a realm of light and joy in music in the style of michael nyman the rest is a it was expected to be nevertheless sweet pretty and sentimental music at times derivations of chopin in the style of richard clayderman that thing returns a lot in the double concerto music for elton john ballads for a sentimental hollywood romance the moment of dreamy nostalgia memories hazy image slow motion gauze skirts rustling under the breeze music that yann tiersen could have written folk dances moments that may hark back to late th and early th century english pastoralism like elgar or vaughan williams the lark ascending sometimes the solo violin line even seems to want to reproduce that of brahms violin concerto in fact just read what the composer says about it and you can guess whats in store this double concerto reveals the importance of the psychological dimension in music at the beginning of this piece the piano plays in a minor key in a state of permanent melancholy the violin on the other hand almost always in a major key swims in happiness and wants to convince his partner to join him there for a long time he doesnt manage it and it is only after three violin solos three passionate cadences that the piano finally says yes because true happiness is happiness shared am i incredibly cynical or is this incredibly corny probably both always when i have multiple versions of a same work ill do some comparative listening here sorry but i cringe anyway given the underlying program of the concerto im in no doubt that kremer plays it with more conviction with his partner latia skanavi here than he did with vadim sacharov in pelecis combined homage to piazzola and oskar stork track is a mixture of symphonic tango thats the piazzola part and of more sentimental and crooning music with syrupy violins oskar strock must be something like the latvian piazzola minutes of it might have been fun nearly seemed aimless the last song the last piece on the cd a solo for violin and strings is minutes long and although it is in the same sentimental brooding nostalgic melancholy vein as the double concerto with the same echoes of early th century english pastoralism vaughan williams tallis fantasia comes to mind its a piece that can hold its own in the neo simplistic trend illustrated by p auml rts fratres at least and to his credit i guess pelecis is entirely unabashed about his aesthetic stance he writes in the liner notes awkwardly translated to english presumably from the german by someone who obviously had only a vague understanding of german when necessary i substitue my own i invite my listeners to be aware that the evolution of music has not only been a progression but also a long sequence of losses these losses are a painful memory to me and i cannot break away from them i try to save and re establish as much as i can for the average listener as indeed for me the scope of classical music from monteverdi to mahler is a paradise that invites us into the most sumptuous realms that the mind of a composer can imagine the imagination of a composer contemplates and rejoices in a certain ideal that of sonic perfection in all its dimensions who then has chased composers from this garden of eden im afraid that theyve done it by their own decision the liner notes translation of the german auf eigene faust here is i rather fear that they have often escaped from their own master this is senseless but i wont let myself be chased away so i remain there and i feel good i see myself almost as a gardener part guardian and part creator of pretty things in the musical paradise that belongs to all of us so this is music for those who equate paradise and sentimental film music de gustibus but im afraid its not the flowers of paradise that pelecis is gardening but cheap plastic avatars salvaged from dumps tt minutes no complaint there at least for those interested in that kind of music
