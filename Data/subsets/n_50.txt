1	Better than the 45 I used to own !
1	Excellent new album, Nick is all grown up.
0	I hate it this CD. It did not relaxed me. It actually enervated me. It also was badly packed so I received it with a broken case.
0	a couple of great numbers but a lot of b side stuff.
0	The I Need AN ANGEL song is absolutely amazing. I love the lyrics because anyone can relate to being in a situation where they are in need of help from above. This song gets a lot of play on my ipod.  Love It!!
0	"Honey for Dinner" is one of the strangest little sets I've heard in a long time.  I can't honestly say I like it.  I want to.  Clare Rojas' cover is visually stunning with the little bees on a stump in a creek and the little black bears rolling back and eating the honey dripping from the mountains.  The cover is the best part of the package.  Peggy's voice is thin, not a warbly as Victoria Williams or quite like Cyndi Lauper's (both of whom I certainly enjoy), but unusual.  All of the tracks are quite short with the longest being 2 minutes 22 seconds.  "Sympathy Date," the opener, is about the most commerical, if you can call it that.  "Red Light Running Baby" has the enthusiasm of one who's just learned how to strum a guitar.  "Darlin' Man" is a whimsical melody like a faint aroma from the garden, "We can go to the bayou pond and watch the turtles & ducks pop their heads off."  "Moon" is a trite little melody about a girl who doesn't want to live on the moon.  "Hug My Heart" may have a different melody than the previous songs, but it's kind of hard to tell.  "Puppy Love" gets quite energetic in a one-instrument arrangement kind of way; and the vocals seem to have some relationship to the guitar.  "Honey for Dinner" is a pitiful little ditty about hungry people who substitute kisses for dinner when they have no food; like the music, it's not completely filling.  "Games" has David Pajo on banjo who plays like he's been doing it for several weeks.  "Bower Band" sounds like depression at a funeral.  Her take on Elvis' "All Shook Up" has huge quantities of hiss engineered to make it sound rustic, perhaps; it's guaranteed the oddest version of the track you'll have ever heard.  I'm not quite sure why this artist made this recording, perhaps to prove she could.  It's a good curiosity piece, but not satisfying musically.  Second star for the cover.  Taxi!
0	I love these two artist & for a father & son to collaborate is beautiful. This is a playlist song
0	I have tried to download this song twice, I have been charged for it twice and it is still not on my computer.  I cannot find anywhere on Amazon.com to complain or get help (oh it does tell me I've already purchased the item but not how to play it).  Beware ....
0	eh, not as good as I thought.  Loved the story about how the band started and how these guys supported each other through a health crisis - that was really the reason I bought it.
1	I have been a fan of Buffy and James Marsters for years, but was not thrilled with this at all. The music was boring and not as exciting as his brief singing spots on Buffy. I'd pass on this one.
1	There honestly has been a big return to the sound of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes classic standard If You Don't Know Me By Now. The soulful singer Seal had delivered a mixed verdict of the song, which didn't completely hit the nail on the head, as good as Simply red scored 20 years ago. But when a signature gets sampled, it doesn't actually mean it is going to sound better than the original. that sadly is the case with Ciara. Her song Never Ever, from her upcoming album Fantasy Ride, doesn't capture the distinctive appeal. In fact, the sample really is very weak from the voice, and brings in less to the soul. I really didn't feel the collaboration she has with Young Jeezy as organic, in the same context that she had as weak with Justin Timberlake on Love, Sex, Magic. If Ciara does another collaboration soon, it needs to feel stronger than saying you are ever, ever going to know it.  Song: D
0	good
0	Love this album!
1	Ms. O'Connor truly brought out the magic in this song with her lovely vocal and arrangement. This may be even better than the Fleetwood Mac version on their Mirage album. I highly recommend this.
0	Love this track.
1	Love it
0	I love Drake, but I think this CD is a burned copy. Not an original. The artwork would not load and the CD was not recognized by my itunes or Amazon music. The sleeve artwork is blurry. When I clicked "get artwork," I got a bunch of Asian writing instead of a title. These are all copies!
1	Track 1:  Drunk people aren't rapists. Track 2:  If you're drunk you deserve to be raped. Track 3:  Not all rapes are really rape rape.
1	Love Michael Forever!
1	Needtobreathe has such a unique sound. Every single album of theirs is amazing. They are definitely one of my favorite bands!
0	love it
0	deftones need to call it quits. the gore I a hit and miss big time. their last good work white poney RAP METAL & NU METAL was cool.
0	I heard a few of his songs on the radio so I decided to get his CD and I'm glad I did. Every single song is good and I am completely enjoying it. Good job Ed.
0	So good to have The Mavericks recording again.  We've missed them!  This CD was worth waiting for.  Best song?  As Long As There's Loving Tonight.
1	I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
1	Some his finest work!
0	The vinyl did not come in good condition. The ad read as "like a new", but the disc has some scratches which makes some songs skip and some dirty dust too!. The sleeve are very good. Sorry for my bad english!!!
0	You people are so blind it does not even make sense. This young lady is a materialistic waste of trash. Please Brown leave the rap game as soon as you can. All you talk about is your dumb a$$ benz and lousy Prada boots!!!!!!!!!(BORING!!!!!) Who wants to hear somebody talk about themselves through the whole damn album. You are still a little girl,even when you started. Please get rid of her, she is a terrible rapper. She is not a female "Tupac". She is just another "Trina". Bragging about materialistic garbage so cowardly. She has no talent. Bahamadia, has talent. To the ones who have purchased this album, please go back to the store and get your money back. Take that money and buy a bunch of cd-r's. Burn her album on that, and do not support her. She does not deserve to even be considered an mc. She is garbage!! Watch where you put your money into. They are bragging from your money that you spent on them. Just imagine if everybody did this to Cash Money. We need to stop supporting uninspired materialistic garbage that will not help you to grow as a person. Music is supposed to be inspirational, not a handful of braggarts. Stop supporting them!!!
0	Ok
0	What is this? I didn't order
1	Her & Vince are great together !
1	They have sparked my interest.. I hope they are more then a one hit wonder. Thanks Amazon for the abilities U give Us.
1	Tasha Cobbs is anointed to sing this song!! Your hands can't help but raise your hands in worship while singing or hearing this song!!!
0	Decent tune but a little overplayed on the radio.  This song worked well for a friend's playlist so I had to grab it.
1	Blue Magic reminds me of my brother who is no longer with us on this earth, but will always be in my heart. On Summer nights long ago we sat out in the yard and sang til morning. Having family and friends around on those cool evenings with a drink in one hand and a mike in the other. What precious memories.
1	Gave as Xmas gift
1	Excellent tune, perfect choice for the 'America's National Parks' film!  Maybe more 'celtic' than 'oldtime,' but as a guitarist, I loved it!
1	Wonderful song.  Brings back many memories.
0	I love Toni and Babyface. This is a great song!  It is about relationships and how sometimes you get hurt.
1	Best album yet... Tyrese
1	If you enjoy singing on par with drunken karaoke bar patrons, this CD is for you!  If not, better alternatives abound...
0	This is a great song, almost considered somewhat of a classic in the Jazz Genre.  Have enjoyed Joe Samples music and work for years.  Do not think you will be disappointed.
1	Mm its alright
1	Not sure how to review a masterpiece
0	excellent"
1	My buddy recently asked me "hey, you still got that old Cop band music?" I Immediately knew what he meant and reached for the Hot Action Cop CD that had been collecting dust.  I'm glad he said something because I was quickly reminded how awesome this band is.  I did my yearly random check on Amazon to see if they had anything new out and lookie lookie what I found?  A 6 song album that totally rocks just as much as the stuff that originally hooked me.  PLEASE MAKE MORE MUSIC!!  Favorite track was "Plane Crash"
0	This is NOT the real soundtrack from the film!!!! This has lots of added music on top of the original tracks that should not be there and ruin the vibe. NOT happy at all!!!! Hopefully some day there will be a real release of the complete soundtrack.
0	well this is not trance, not progressive, so whats this... can somebody answer me....  I think tiesto is trying to hard to be david guetta.. he es trying to have commercial success which is not a bad thing but hes trying to hard...  The album has like 2 good songs, and thats it... The songs  (eventhe good ones) are to light the are not work out..  I guess tiesto took a path with no turning back.. and that path is super commercial DJ
1	love cd
1	When I first heard this song on the radio I wanted a copy of it !!! The lyrics really touched me!!!
