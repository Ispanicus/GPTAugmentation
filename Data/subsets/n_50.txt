0	Bought CD, but not version of song I wanted.  Rest of CD was not good.  Returned was refused.  Now what?
0	sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me
0	I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
0	GREAT BAND ! GREAT SONG ! Too bad this download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG !!
0	I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
0	Dudn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #2 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)????
0	After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.    I also found the lyrics sophomoric, saccrine, and self- consciously "new agey" with a thiny veiled, but oh so deep  christian overtones.  Some of them were laughable - as if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem!  I'm sorry but I really regret reading the words because they pretty much spoiled what little I liked about the recording.    The album had a very slick, commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me.  And finally, when reading the liner notes, it says that that producer/choral master dubbed in voices from older boys to give everything a "fuller" sound!  Come on! If you are going to picture young, prepubescent lads on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little "angels" are doing ALL the singing,  stick with that!   This album and director are slickness personified and will only do as background/elevator music in my opinion.    There are other children's choirs recordings that don't sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter, singing silly lyrics and being over-dubbed to make them sound better.  The whole idea and uniqueness of children's choirs is that they don't have the trained voices of professionals and don't sound perfect!!    Try the many recordings of the Vienna Boy's Choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album.  If you love good choral music as I do, this will only serve to frustrate you, so walk away.  I suggest you don't make the same mistake I did! You will be sorry.   A few songs are OK to listen to, but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least.....
0	If this song is in my Amazon cloud collection, I am unaware of making this purchase.  If i in fact did make this purchase, I don't like this song at all.
0	To begin, please understand two things about me:  1: I Love Westerns. 2: I`ve been a fan of the character 'Jonah Hex' for over 30 years.  In the comics, Jonah Hex caught my interest because of the gritty, hard-edged stories that featured a tough ex-Confederate soldier turned hard-case Bounty Hunter roaming the old West. I won`t belabor the details, but if you want a good idea of the tone of Jonah Hex; most fans liken Clint Eastwood`s "The Outlaw Josie Wales" to practically be a Jonah Hex movie. Jonah Hex would indeed ask the immortal question "You Gonna Pull Those Pistols, Or Whistle Dixie?"  The movie "Jonah Hex", while somewhat capturing the charaacter`s 'Attitude', unfortunately sees fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that James West would laugh at ( ...I mean...c`mon...twin Gatling Guns mounted on a saddle? ...a gun that shoots lit sticks of dynamite ?? )  Jonah Hex --the character -- was NEVER about gadgets and gimmicks, or Bringing The Dead Back To Life for Q&A sessions.  It`s painfully obvious that the makers of this movie were too timid to risk a straight, hard-edged WESTERN, so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience ...and created A MESS.  Now, I do enjoy so-called 'Steampunk' --The afformentioned 'The Wild Wild West' tv series is a good example--but the storyline of  Jonah Hex The Character just was never about Steampunk.  Neither does the character require supernatural powers to be interesting.  This film has been compared to Sonnenfeld`s 1999 "Wild Wild West", which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit. It`s a common trend in Hollywood: "Let`s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change things"....The changes of course are "To make it more appealing to a broader audience" ... So the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? Hey--Hollywood knows best what people will like...right?  The real tragedy here is that, like James West; Jonah Hex has now been ruined for The Big Screen and likely  will never get another shot at that venue.  Of course, film-makers in Hollywood these days have long since  lost all faith in the Western genre.  It`s too bad...Great characters create fans by being appealing, by being...great. The movie "Jonah Hex" was a twisted take on a great character; twisted to suit the perceived tastes of teenagers who supposedly would not like a solid Western character.  Well....I was a teenager when I became a Jonah Hex fan.
0	Leave the lights is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better becareful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
0	This is not the accapella. This is labeled incorrectly. I purchased it because someone else wrote that it was in fact the accapella but that is not true.
0	After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
0	I bought the clean version by mistake. I would never buy a clean version Eminem album. So make sure it is what you're looking for
0	Not happy with it. Only contained 11 songs. The digital has 18. Some of my favorites wee not on the cd.
0	His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
0	Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!
0	Meh
0	I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.
0	Fine voice; SAME FOUR CHORDS OVER AND OVER.
0	I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
0	the packaging made the cd looked used, everything looks bad quality and it doesn't not include all the songs that says in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	better than the second cd but not as good as the first cd
0	Don't waste your money on a bimbo who supports cop killers.  Music was awful. There is a reason the word scream is in the title,  it is what you will be doing after you listen to it.
0	I have this one to give to someone else.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax...there just is not enough other instruments in the music...I have now learned to buy Smooth Jazz productions that contain a variety of music from other musicians...
0	Came wutg cinoyter,
0	Creepy as f### lyrics and Danzig's voice...what's not to love?
1	Great for Meditation.  I have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day, so I like the calm music of this album.
1	Hall and Oats.  Need I say more.
1	What can your say, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!
1	Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
1	Good song. Good positive vie minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover. smh Liked it the first time I heard it.
1	Wow so worth it!
1	Love the song. Good, easy download!
1	the words say it all. It gives me peace in a turbulent world, I have loved the music of Dallas Holm for over 30 years
1	Shazam'd this song off "The Good Wife". Its an empowering song!
1	Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.
1	Sad time in my life but that's what being 19 yrs old is all about.  Oh Yeah, Good song too.
1	Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.
1	Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.  The lessons challenge you and I know I sing better now. I recommend this for the beginner, the wannabe, and someone just wanting to sing better.  Maryelle B
1	I listen to to this entire set before I go on a job interview.  It strangely empowers me.
1	The whole family loves this song. It is a call to action and sticks with you. From the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith.
1	I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor , praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs also,  one of my Sisters who also has a Women's Ministry called  'Arise' she'll use this song as the theme song for her next Women's Conference.  Hallelujah!  May The Lords Blessings and Peace, Wisdom and Knowledge continue to be poured into and upon these awesome Men of God.
1	Good song
1	One of his best that is not often recorded.
1	if your looking for western swing to play at Christmas, this is it. Ray Benson delivers holiday cheer for all.
1	Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
1	I love r. Kelly and this song was back in the days when bumping and grinding was ok and you didn't worry about stalker
1	So many beautiful songs that touch you in whatever stage your life is in.
1	While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
1	If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set. The recording of the piano quintet was enthusiastic and perfectly satisfactory recording to first hear it. There is a lot of other great music on this box. This  box brings a lot of music at an incredibly cheap price. I hope that lots of people who do not know Schubert will have a chance to experience this music. His music is full of beauty and passion.
