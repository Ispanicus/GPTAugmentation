Amazon review: "It's about time someone creates something original. I'm so sick and tired of hearing the same thing on radio. Tripsitter sound is like a trip on nostalgia. They have an original sound while using spices from the Beach Boys and the Beatles but their main ingredient is original song writing. I don't believe there's anything modern out there like it. Not only that but the songs are actually good. They're well-written and their catchy.  They don't rely on the boom-boom of over-produced tracks like most "pop" music. California Son and the first album take you back to a time when songwriters did things the classic way, you know when they simply wrote good music."
