Amazon review: "I have this one to give to someone else.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax...there just is not enough other instruments in the music...I have now learned to buy Smooth Jazz productions that contain a variety of music from other musicians..."

Amazon review: "I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since."

Amazon review: "Don't waste your money on a bimbo who supports cop killers.  Music was awful. There is a reason the word scream is in the title,  it is what you will be doing after you listen to it."

Amazon review: "I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit."
