1	I enjoyed her earlier albums.  This is an over-produced, under-thought, lazy effort.  Glad it was inexpensive b/c it is certainly cheap.
0	Grant is fantastic! Great blues album.
0	This song serves as a reminder of how imperfect I am and how I need to surrender daily.  Love it.
1	are you kidding me? electronic piano + same fire noise. not recommend
0	If you love the violin and jazz, you will be seduced by this arrangement. I have played this CD repeatedly and enjoyed it more each time. I am glad I bought it. Every cut is  a joy to listen to.
1	Blue Magic reminds me of my brother who is no longer with us on this earth, but will always be in my heart. On Summer nights long ago we sat out in the yard and sang til morning. Having family and friends around on those cool evenings with a drink in one hand and a mike in the other. What precious memories.
0	Archie has an amazing voice. Crush, on the other hand is so over-produced it barely lets his voice come through.  I don't think the song is horrible, it is just that Archie is so much better than this song allows him to be!  (And honestly, the song after hearing it a few times is rather boring...)  And before all you rabid Archie fans jump all over this review, stop and think about what I am saying.  I am reviewing THIS SONG, not Archie.  You have to admit Crush is NOT the best vehicle to let Archie's vocals shine.  I hope his album showcases more of David's great voice.
0	In France, say "Barbara" and everyone (or at least everyone "of a certain age," as the French say) knows who you mean -- one of the greatest popular singers of the 20th century.  She was, to French music, the Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion of her time.  The thing that puts Barbara in a superior category is the fact that she composed almost all of her greatest hits and then sang them with inimitable power and grace. I love almost all of her songs, but this one is uniquely special.  Supposedly autobiographical, this song recounts the final meeting of a long-absent father with his daughter. In fact, Barbara's journal (found after her death in 1997) indicates child abuse, separation, and no final reunion. This song is, thus, the cathartic invention of a mature woman, and is, thus, all the more poignant.  Emotionally stirring and utterly beautiful.
1	And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*.
1	Not good
0	If you need any evidence of the importance of Morrisey to the Smiths, buy Johnny's first solo album and you will hear it for yourself.  This CD is pretty bad, amateurish songs caught between Bryan Adams and The Fixx.  Do not waste your money on this one.  Morrisey must be laughing out loud over this lame effort
0	First rate performance and excellent, audiophile quality recording.
0	I first heard this group when they appeared on Katie Couric's show, and had to buy the record.  Love the harmony!
1	Husband and wife make contemporary Christian pop music.  Pretty good with good messages.
1	This is an extremely well-crafted, emotionally stirring song. Great production, superb lyrics, and excellent musicianship. An amazing song!
0	Great soundtrack - good shipping
0	My goodness how I missed Adam! This song was worth the wait. Great upbeat tempo & beautiful but sad lyrics. Can't wait for his album next month! Welcome back Mr Lambert!
0	Wonderful music, fast delivery.
1	Item arrived with broken CD case.
0	Old recording, NOT SACD as advertised!
0	This song did not successfully download onto my computer, I was unable to access it.
1	Fun recording of the song- goes up to eight elephants.
1	I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
1	listened to this one time and have no desire to put it on again......
0	great
1	the song is good but the picture is inappropriate and i don't really know spanish but it is still a good song
1	I bought this because I mistakenly thought that the "Southern Nights" track was the version with the artist's narration about growing up around N.O..  My bad, as that version is recorded in "Songbook," which I also now have.  However, I was not disappointed with the magical and masterful performance of Mr. Toussaint, of one of America's all-time greatest musical talents.  Extraordinary!
1	This is a sad excuse for music from talent as great as these musicians. I won't become redundant as the reviews (15% being 1 star) speak for themselves.  I'd like to see Mumford and Son's come back to what they once were.
0	This song isn't very good.  My daughter probably did this.
1	Blast from the past... what a treat.
0	This does not sound like the original Barbara Mason.  Don't waste your money on this CD.  Probably can find the original on another site.
1	I wasn't really sure how this album would turn out because I really enjoyed Raheem Davaughn's throw back album a few  years ago, but I would up really liking this. I thought R. Kelly did a quality job on csovering the 60, and his singing was really good. People make fun of his music so much, that I almost forgot how good of a singer he really is. I really liked his duet with Chrisette Michele. She fits really well with this type of soul music. I would recommend buying this if your a fan of R n B music!
1	this is not music from the movie...made the mistake of thinking it was....do not like this style of music ...why could n't they give you the actual MUSIC from the movie ..ah well live and learn will not play this cd again ever....
0	My family has listened to several of their albums and have never been disappointed. This album is, once again, a hit in our house. Their voices are maturing and still sound fantastic.
1	It pains me a little to say this but this is my least favorite Michael Roe/ 77s release.  This is a quiet countrified and bluesy affair.  Roe supplies multi-track vocals/ acoustic and electric guitars/ mandolin/ banjo/ ukele and is assisted by Mark Harmon (bass and household percussions) and Bryan Meyers (other percussion).  For those who might not know this is a collection of old spiritual songs such as what we have on Holy Ghost Building.  These spirituals aren't my thing but HGB was listenable.  The first half of We All Gonna Face the Rising Sun follows suit.  Beginning with the scratchy, bluesy Jonah In the Wilderness and honeyed Dry Bones Roe continues to put his little touches and differences in these old hymns.  He follows suit with the next two tracks imbuing Woke Up This Morning With My Mind with a Michael row your boat ashore lullaby call and response and Come To the Savior Today simply sounds like a gentle lullaby youd sing to your child.  You Cant Go Halfway has a quiet, old time country played out of a barn charm.  But the album comes to a screeching halt with the title track!  Sounding like a legit old negro spiritual, Roe multi-tracks his vocals in deeper registers to sound as if hes on a chain gang or gleaning in the slave fields toiling away under the hot sun.  You cant say that this song doesnt give the album even more nuanced variety but it doesnt play on Roes strong suits and I find myself skipping it or wishing it to be over (I almost always listen through an album start to finish and force myself to listen to those tracks Im not fond of).  A few tracks later he goes the same route I Know My Time Aint Long.  Between these two tracks are the meant to be the country blues barn burner Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down but without enough heat to burn the barn down and the annoying Paul and Silas.  I say annoying not for the lyrical content but for the way that Roe sounds like hes singing out the side of his mouth.  Hes always been very playful and versatile and even chameleonic in his vocal stylings but this ones not good.  Whats worse is the drunk stupefied sloshing of Im Goin Home with slurring so bad at points that you cant make out whats being sung.  That song comes on and I just cringe.  The final cut, We Need More Rattlesnakes, is not so much a song as a fun backwoods spoken word tale of an uncouth and blusterous family who need salvation but only get it under the fear of death.  My main issue with this release is not Roes adding variety and distinctions between the songs but its the last half of the disc.  The first half, though each song is given a distinct feel, is cohesive while the last half is disjointed and jumbled and theres some stinkers on there.  Real stinkers.  You may like the whole release but if you liked Holy Ghost Building Id caution you to temper your expectations when it comes to the second half of this release.  2.5 stars.
1	The first CD plays fine, however the 2nd disc of the 2 disc CD set will not play. Very disappointed.
1	I was just wanting the song.
1	Remade, NOT the original!
1	grew up to this song, it's actually a sample from Bobby Caldwell's "Do For Love". who would've thought?
0	I love this song! This was the first Lindsey Stirling song I heard on Pandora and it got me hooked. I'm a big fan now.
1	Great song and reliable delivery by Amazon.
0	poor guy
0	Not feeling quite as inventive as some prior albums of theirs.  Very familiar, and in that, fits like a comfortable fleece.  Next album hopefully rocks my world a bit more.
0	Great CD! I wanted more songs, he's such a great artist.  I would recommend this CD to my friends with confidence that they would not be disappointed.
1	total disarray of nothing but noise.not worth any amount of money. don't even try to listen to this train wreck
1	I cannot adequately describe how amazing this man is/was!  He is the most incredible song writer in the last 50 years...maybe ever!  I have never before witnessed and artist who can pair such complex musical arrangements with such magnificently insightful lyrics about the human condition.  Not only are the compositions incredible, but the ability of Harry and his band to pull these songs off so effortlessly in a live setting is nothing short of astounding.  I could go on forever about how much his music means to me, but I won't.  Suffice it to say, this album, like all his others, is transcendant.  Buy it.  Keep Harry's music alive.  His birthday should be a national holiday!  Damn, I love Harry Chapin! P.S. It would be remiss of me to neglect thanking the person who bought this for me. It's actually an original album with Harry's autograph.  It is now one of my most treasured possessions.  Thank you.
0	This is the beginning Ed's 2nd chapter in his solo career since the split up with Live and I gotta say I'm extremely impressed.  I feel that the quality of the songs have vastly improved over his solo album "Alive", which I thought was also good.  Whereas "Alive" felt rushed in a number of ways, "The Garden EP" feels completely opposite.  It appears that Ed and his producer Jamie Candiloro took their time in the creation of these songs.  Standouts for me are "The Garden" and "Solar Flare".  "I'm the Proof" is a quality song that I feel lost something during production compared to when I heard it in concert a few months ago (I think it's the chorus where Ed's voice is recorded over Ed's voice multiple times.  I'll admit though that my knowledge of production is limited).  "Rise" is a good pop-rock song that appears to be written about his old bandmates and bad feelings that still exist there.  Ed also did a cover of John Lennon's "Mind Games" and his voice is spectacular in it.  I'm not a fan of remixes, so those didn't really do anything for me but I bought the EP for the regular versions of the songs so it didn't bother me one way or the other.  Looking forward to the rest of the album which is due out in Spring 2013.
1	I first heard it on Charter's Music Choice dance channel.  Cool dance song and love the Howard Jones sample.  On my dance and party songs playlists.
1	It's my own fault really. I like Ignition (Remix) and when I purchased this song that is what I thought it was. I personally don't like this particular song.
1	I live with highway noise and all sorts of other distractions. Why in the world would I want to hear the beautiful Canon in D with freeway noise in the background?
1	missing the booklet
1	<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Hits-The-B-Sides-3/dp/B001QUTFFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Hits/The B-Sides 3</a>&nbsp;has all the b-sides 1 & 2 plus  if you already have the b-sides 1 get this to complete your collection. if you do not have either i suggest getting the complete collection for $25.
1	A favorite from the soundtrack of MY life.
1	THE BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!! If I could give it 10 stars...I would. The lyrics are brilliantly expressed. Tank...hats off to you. This is a REAL MAN talken about real situations....and the intimacy of it all is mind-blowing. My hubby and I love this album and we thank you for taking it there!!! Keep doing what you do and "Speak ON IT". You've set the bar for male R&B. It's your time, no more being Under-Rated! Be Blessed
1	Our wedding song
1	brings me back to the good ol days!
1	This album is awesome!! I love Mac's voice!! also, the lead singer of flyleaf and Chris Daughtry are both featured on the cd. Every song rocks!!
0	Fabulous music, love the violin and the piano in the background. The music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me. One of the best CD's ever!
1	The cd came before est date I have been looking for this for a while why I didn't think of Amazon do not even ask. Brand spanking new never opened great price,and one of the best of the best Isley Brothers love song  disc ever. Thank you.
1	There is another MP3 on the site that isn't "the right one." This is the full length song, and it's a classic.
0	so i heard this terrible artist singing live at the nba all star game and i literally wanted to never hear music again.  she sings completely through her nose,  there is no reason for her to even have her mouth open at all.  she's not "punk",  she's not "grunge" or "rock".  she's just plain awful.  please don't waste your money and don't support a music industry that thinks this is entertainment, or even good.  if you want good music don't go here.  and thanks go out to fefe, for inspiring me to make good music and to not EVER sound like her.  i'd rather give this no stars but in order to review i will give it one.
0	I am so shocked that Lana Lane never became a music superstar.........  She has a gorgeous voice, her band is very talented, and her original songs are amazingly original and true to the spirit of classic and progressive rock - very high quality music and lyrics !  Her band did some remakes of classics from the 60's and 70's, such as this one - they did a great job !
1	#1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 sweet cool awsom ha h
1	Excellent Tejano music from El Rey de Tejano!!!
0	Boring music.  Great while watching movie
1	Reverb does not an album make.
1	Every time I use these tracks, another company on YouTube flags them as a copyright violation. I don't actually know who ones the rights, but it's annoying as heck because I cannot monetize my videos until I've challenged them and waited a month for each one to clear. I would not buy this album had I know this happens all the time! The music itself is great though, so if you're not uploading to YouTube, buy it.
0	The cd sucked I couldn't copy it to my computer. There was something wrong with it.
1	Jackie has grown up!  Beautiful voice, different sound for her, I think, but I like it.
0	This is a cover of Iron Man by Black Sabbath.  You must listen to this.  Really.  It is genius.  I cannot believe I just discovered it.  The world is a better place for this song's existence.
1	After a few decades, many bands run out of creativity and commit to mediocrity but not Yes.  This album shows that Yes can maintain their standards of fresh content and originality.  The new singer is just fine, no problems there.  If you like Yes then this album is a great choice.
1	Couldn't play it
1	Some day`s I can`t get it out of my mind  Hugh C.
0	Excellent album
1	I enjoy the work of All That Remains, they were at the top of there game in the beginning. Every album from the late 90's to early 00's seem to be such an amazing piece of work, now we are in modern times and we have this mellow, weak, over harmonizing band. This album is weak, and really shows that band is going downhill(if they haven't already) No-Knock has to be the only decent song on this album, Everything else is just a ballad inducing bland song.
0	The song I fell in love to !!
0	My hubby loves the CD.
1	Not to be picky but I listenedd to the entire album and I didn't hear anything remotely resembling a Native Flute. If you are looking for Native American flute music like R. Carlos Nakai or Mary Youngblood, steer clear. If you're looking for generic synthesized spa music, this album is ok.
1	Very good. Own regular version so first ten songs were a waste but the next 20 were quite enjoyable and needed being that local concert is not for another 2 months
0	A piece of history.  Bernie keeps to his positions for all these years.  Now he is wisely declining to sing.
1	Frequently misunderstood, but hard to stop listening to.  The best tune of its decade in sheer melancholy and reflection.
0	Listening to it as a child and it is still just as magical.
1	great song
1	This isn't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio. If it doesn't grate my nerves that much and doesn't make me feel like i am enduring chinese water torture (like those godawful j-lo/pitbull collaborations), i suppose 2 stars is what i rate this. There's really nothing special here. Average, forgetful top 40 dance pop which will not be remembered by anybody in about five minutes.
0	THIS IS THE WORLD'S WORST DUBSTEP I HAVE EVER HEARD. THE CREATORS OF THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE CONDEMED TO HELL AND ALL THOSE TRYING TO FOLLOW THIS AWFUL,TERRIBLE,POOR,UNCONSIDERATE, style. SHOULD DIE. Jesus told me that in my prayers.
1	I was pretty let down by this album. But I guess it was inevitable after putting out so many good ones. The songs lack emotion and the lyrics are simply not up to snuff with Tom's earlier albums. Anyone here because someone recommended A23, look at his earlier albums for quality music.
1	I don't listen to a lot of U2, and I don't listen to a lot of Mary J. Blige, but I think that together they have made something beautiful. I have had this song for years, and still enjoy listening to it when it goes through one of my playlists.  There is a lot of emotion in the lyrics, and Mary J really strengthens that emotion with her fantastic voice. Much stronger than U2's original recording. It is a hauntingly beautiful reminder to appreciate and take care of what you have, it may not last forever.
0	I regret ordering this song and tried to return it and cancel the payment. There is actually potential with the song, and this unfinsh products only plays the good part of a loop when odering it. This is why i was fooled to oder it. After hearing the hole song, it clearly demonstrate its usless ability to write words let along say words. The truth is there is maybe two sentence if that in a five minute loop. They need to find a MC and add music to there loop, and even then there loop woulnt have any voice over the loop. They ruin the definition of levels, because there loops lock in to everyone virtous rythem to then control your mind, forcing many to harden and make dancing uncomfortable, off course the more you give in to puppeting music, you excepted and you clearly have voice mail issue were they continuously will not leave u alone, leaching on to you every thought and word clearly demonstrated with the music plaid on the radio. Clearly they are reading the levels of the listeners mind to manipulate you rather then to be able to dance freely with rythem. Listen u know what I am talking about, the only thing that should get hard when dancing, what every junky wants, not your back.  The bottom line is if you want to listen to mindless music and let the other count the  levels in your mind to think for you and loose grasp of conversation, this dinamic gold radio genera song or band is perfect for you.
0	50 Cent was, is and never will be the new 2pac. This album is one of the most overrated albums ever. In da club is the only decent track. People if u want some real rap go buy any 2pac album especially ALL EYEZ ON ME
1	Just plain Boring..not one song has a "hook"..even after a little  marinade..nothing. I LOVE most of Joe's albums..IMO he's the most progressive guitarist of all time..always evolving..and still my favorite..but from a purely common, listening perspective - there seems to be none of the melodic, trippy, wondrous note warping, magic that Joe is so good at delivering. ... of course I'm sure any talented guitarist, musician, ect. would certainly appreciate all the technical mastery in this effort.. but I'm really bummed with this latest..
1	I just bought this CD from another site. My gosh is this just a terrible album. It sounds like Bertie has lost his ability to keep in tune with the music. I would not recommend this album to anyone. I absolutely love his "Key Largo" album but this one just sucks!!! I thought he would do a good job on "Sloop John B" but it sailed away on him. It's also good that Cheryl Wilson sang on "Key Largo" on this album because she definitely saved the song.  I think it is time for Bertie to retire and sail away to Key Largo.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Captiva/dp/B001QWFUHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Captiva</a>
1	It's difficult to argue that anyone was ever better than Mozart. It's also difficult not to love the piano. These pieces are well recorded and, conveniently, cheap. My gripe is that you just get this entire pile in a lump. The songs are not organized in any way so it takes awhile to sort through them. Yes, it is over eight hours of music, but it takes a week to figure out how to navigate through it all on whatever player you're using.
0	I bought this album on amazon's mp3 service.  This record is a must-have for old Billy Ward fans and new listeners alike. Whether you're a student of Ward's superlative drum kit stylings or just savor something new in trio jazz, this is the album. Filled with songs that are simultaneously hip for the experienced listener and listenable for the uninitiated, this album resonates with creativity. If you're like me and you like your music varied both deep and broad, then this album won't disappoint.  If I had any criticism, it would only be that amazon suggests that it be listed under "smooth jazz", a term which I use to define most of the music I don't like. Never fear, this record is about as far from mechanistic drum machine-laden smooth jazz grooves as you can get.  I only wish I were in NYC so I could hear this band live!
1	A great performance by two very talented and wonderful people. If this rendition doesn't lift your spirit, nothing will!
1	Ever find yourself in a supermarket or perhaps a department store that has soft rock playing in the background and you hear a tune you know so well but the song title & band elude you?  This happened to me the other day as I listened to the soft melody of "Walk Away Renee", a classic '60's composition from the band "The Left Banke".  Pianist/composer Michael Brown and groups' inclusion of beautiful chamber string arrangements provide for a most relaxingly two and a half minutes of mellow music.  On my old 45 RPM disc, "Walk Away Renee" was the 'A' side with the equally classic "Pretty Ballerina" being the 'B' side.  As my old 45 is worn nearly groove-less, I'm ecstatic to find both find both of these beautiful songs available for download.  For all fellow B-B's, the 99 cent price is really much cheaper than we paid for those darn 45's:)
1	Only liked one song.  Let your hair down David make something fun and not boring.  We hear the same old traditionals every year.
0	The whole album kicks a**. It's been a long time man. They sound so refreshed on this album.  John is sober now, and you can really tell by how good he sounds live.  It's a very creative album, my favorites so far are "Souls in the Machine", and "Boxes!"
0	not as good as i remeneber it
0	This Artist is Planning to take over the world. And the way his music is, he just may do it. This music is nothing like what you've heard before, but at the same time, it's very haunting. You've felt like you've heard it in the back of your mind. His music is hypnotizing, addicting, and inspiring. He also has very humorous track, as well. He's Straight out of a comic book. Is he a hero, or a super-villain? Only you can listen and decide.  This album, self titled "Dr. Steel" Is very entertaining. With a wide variety of themes, it takes you on an incredible journey. And when it stops, you just want more. "Spaceboy" and "Are We having Fun Yet?" are my Favorite two from this album.
0	Bought as a gift. They really enjoyed it.
1	I love this cd!  It gets us dancing and following along which is surprisingly hard to find in children's cds.  And of course, it makes me think of our great wednesdays in highland park dancing to johnny only!
0	I am a huge fan of Twisted Sister, more so, I love this particular song. Now, I have the luxury of listening to the song, repeatedly, in my own library. I own it, so thank you amazon for allowing me to purchase and download the album into my library.
1	Great for quiet moments when you are trying to find an answer to a problem----when all of a sudden the answer appears out of the blue---wonders never cease to amaze me.
1	I'm returning this right now, just opened the package and played. Very disappointed, skips multiple time on each side. Poor quality manufacturing or quality control. Do not buy, much too expensive for this poor product.
1	I like Adele and I like this song.
0	This is NOT the song you know and love from the radio. I wish I could find the original! This version is so bad I deleted it from my iPod!
1	cute and kids love it.
1	The narrative was a bit too obscure for me and instead of relaxing, I spent my energy trying to figure out what he was talking about.
1	I only give it one star cuz I accidently ordered it.  Then when it asked me to download all songs purchased I foolishly clicked "YES."  Sooooooooo...maybe I should give myself only one star.
0	Very classic. My all time fave!
1	I was trying somd new music anx thought I wou loo d try this. It was a mistake a this is another album I would buy
0	I like this song.
1	The sound of The xx is back in their second electrifying album, "Coexist." The same fluid electronic sound found in their first self-titled album can be found here as well even more dreamily and mysteriously than before! Many have complained that the album's songs all exist in the same, mono-toned sound. Though there are a couple of songs that might seem to fall a bit flat next to the more popular ones, the overall effect of the album is a dreamy magnificence parallel to none.  My top 3 favorite songs have to be: 1) 2 - Chained 2) 3 - Fiction 3) 6 - Sunset  These are some of the best standouts of the album in addition to their very popular single, Angels. All in all, this is definitely a must-buy if you are a lover of unique, indie musical experiences. As a side note, the guitar and bass are UNREAL. :)
1	Good song.
0	Very soothing music
1	Beautiful song. Worth every penny!
0	My all time top 5 favorite songs.
0	Couldn't get into the actual hypnosis because of the static and skipped audio portions of this download. What I was able to hear seemed really good, however. Perhaps skipping the MP3 download and simply buying the tape would be a lot better, albeit more expensive.
0	good
0	Virtually every song of this very good and diverse genre TD 2 CD set was performed by Edgar Froese. He's essentially the only remaining member of Tangerine Dream for the past two years. Edgar's the patriarch of electronic music. On "Booster" he uses his boundless keyboard, synth and guitar musical skills to deliver several masterful soundscapes. He has the muli-talented virtuosity and autonomy to lead Tangerine Dream all by himself. He has mastered every niche of their sound.
1	First heard this song around Sept'  of  1959, after Dad returned home to the U.K. from a visit to the U.S. I enjoyed 'El Paso' back then, and I still am enjoying it now. Marty Robbins  had a nice run of songs; they don't make 'e-mail like that anymore. For me, great nostalgic value.
0	I looked forward to this album with great anticipation. I owned both her studio albums & a live performance from The House of Blues in Chicago. They had some shortcomings, but overall I was very pleased with them. What I liked most was her voice and how her personality came shining through. On this album, her voice is so subdued, almost to a whisper at times and it seems to lack personality. I'm sure these songs will sound better live as Alison is a charismatic & dynamic performer on stage. But for now, I am very disappointed.
1	Kutless is a great band! This venture into Praise & Worship is an instant classic. Their arrangements of these songs keep the original spirit the songs were written with, but adds that classic Kutless sound.
0	I always liked this one by Sheryl. I think it's simple and sweet, and always a good listen. Love it!
1	This will make you feel like a kid again! It hits you right there in the sentimentals. If you're at all on the fence about it, go for it!
1	but not as good as sigh no more.  sophmore albums rarely live up to the freshman effort.  still 5 stars
1	If you love Blaine and you love Glee you will definitively love this CD.  This is my favorite CD I have in my car.
1	This is Annihilator's best album. This band is really versatile, showing different styles and climates. From the total aggression changes to the most beautiful melodies. Fast songs, semi-ballads, hard rock, you`ll find all that here. Sometimes they sound like Overkill, sometimes Europe, sometimes like any Hard Rock band with the greatest sense of humour. These guys show here that they are not only performers, thay are complete musicians. My favorites are "Set the world on fire"(a classic), "Brain Dance" and "Snake in the grass". No matter which music style you listen to, you  should get this CD and listen to a great band.
1	I am a big fan of Vince Gill. His new CD Down to My Last Bad Habit is great! It is a must have for all fans of Vince.
0	Writing in 2014, this is an old CD, but it is a classic. It shows what was being produced by the Brits around 2001, and I remember how God was moving around the world in wonderful, presence-filled worship. As all good worship CDs require, this one needs to be listened to when you have time set aside to get close to Him.  If you do that, this CD will definitely move you to His presence.
0	Yes
1	I love this song.
1	Love this song !
0	the deluxe version is definitely worth it all the tracks are good
1	i ordered a CD which i thought was by jason lee of memphis blue and received a CD from an unknown person.  i asked before purchashing if it was the jason lee of memphis.  maybe they forgot my question.  anyway, i received a full credit, so am satisfied.
1	...but this is a poorly produced CD. Both the computer-enhanced chorus that overwhelms the solos, and the overuse of vibrato in the solos make this a definite disappointment.
0	I love everything about this movie. The book, the characters, the actors, and actresses, but the first thing that I fell in love for is the song. This song chimes in my mind every single day. I had always love Celtic kind of music, this one hit the spot!
1	Wow Great Item Reminds Me Of When Charley Started Singing..
0	love the way he redone the song Joy To The World  hope he dose a  lot more songs he's a very good singer
1	Horrible. Totally ruint a good bands music
1	These two products have no place being together.  The grateful dead album is great - for what it is....their first album, before they even defined themselves. To put this with the midnights album is sinful. Where the beat meets the street just plain sucks!
1	This is the only Winehouse work that I've purchased.  Really haven't heard much of her until I checked out a video performance of "Monkey Man" which blew me away.  She knew her way around ska.  And soul too.  She does an excellent take on Sam Cooke's "Cupid".  "Valerie" is great, as is the entire EP.  Now I have to check out some of her other recordings.
1	i just bought it for mistake!! i wanted another one... but noooot thiisss one!! so i don't like it!!! i don't hear englhish music!!
1	Ms. LeeJai Cook, Roaring Springs TEXAS. I am not all that learned on the subject of music.  However, this song is marvelous from start to finish. I play it quite often. This song contains no dull moments. I would definitely recommend that you purchase it.
1	SLOW.....DULL......BORING..... MONOTONOUS..... CRAP...... just isn't manson.... whatt happened to him? did his balls drop off? i don't understand....  it might as well just be one long boring song
0	koko taylor is a genius--her soul is left on this song--have heard several versions but no one sings the blues like her -why have I never heard of her--AMAZING!!!!
1	great song.
1	this download comes from a busy four month period in early 1969, which produced several official releases which are considered by many fans as some of the best releases ever. these are 'live dead' ,, 'live at the fillmore west' ,, 'live at the fillmore east' and this download. featuring songs and extended jams that include some great pigpen led tunes, the band was completely into their acid rock and roll phase, with many of their most well known hits of the time included :: dark star, st. stephen, the eleven, morning dew, turn on your lovelight, just to name a few. if you like this style of grateful dead this download is a must. when you compare the cost, it really is not out of line with some of the cds from this era and well worth adding to your collection. if you watch amazon, they usually put downloads on sale now and then as well.
1	What an interesting hybrid of great music! There is true joy in these recordings with great singing and musicianship. Lots of fun! A must have for children and adults alike!
0	Ahhhhh, the 3rd volume is now being played in my car.  Pentatonix doesn't disappoint.  This volume includes a song with violin & cello accompaniment.  I thought it would bother me to have that on an a capella album, but I really like the added depth.  Not that PTX EVER lacks depth.  Now I'm just waiting for the release of their Christmas album.  Sure hope they are already working on their next project!  Everyone I've shared their music with has been very pleased with their sound.  I think they span the age gap.  I'm in my mid 50s and am a serious fan!  They are WREAKING with talent.  Watch them on YouTube and you'll love them even more.  They are so much fun.  I'd LOVE to get to spend a day with them watching them create their magic!
0	Love this soundtrack! So happy Amazon had it for download.
0	I am a big Steve Earle fan. And an even bigger Shawn Colvin lover. I think Steve Earle has produced some of the finest sounding music. That said, this CD is muddled and extremely disappointing. I couldn't wait for two of my favorite artists to release this. I get tense just listening- and I've tried. Plowed through it at least 5 times. I was very psyched for Soneday. Colvin covered it so brilliantly on Cover Girl and  Steve does several versions of his great song. Simply put- it's awful
1	Feels like a posthumous album of unfinished ideas a label would release decades later for the sake of making money. 1 song with vocals? Really? At least 4 songs are rehashes or demos of old catalog PF hits. As a huge Floyd fan-shame on you Gilmour for releasing this album. Better to burn out then fade away like you did as you float down this endless river of boring instrumentals with no memorable guitar leads or hooks.
1	I love her music!  I wish I discovered her years ago!
0	...is from a beautiful 17th century Japanese haiku (poem) inspired by the poet seeing a flowering wild violet in the mountains ... and a melody which is incredibly sweet and meanderingly soft and slow...  Others are entitled to their analytical opinions on this one and what language is what, but if you are in sync with Enya's thoughts, I think it best not to exaggerate the importance ascribed to its original language, except to give it a fresh breath of fantasy exoticness.  Nature is about sound.  In what language does a bird call ... a river tumble and a leaf flail in a stiff Zephyr.  Enya's sound is universally beautiful and it is no exception for this lovely song.  I believe it spent some time at the number #1 spot in Japan and would like to better know the lyrics, to feel them, but that's only the cream on top of a wonderful work that comes together in perfect harmony.  I prefer to sit back and close my eyes and imagine that I could effortlessly say all the Japanese love words for the natural world, like a soft spring breeze gently rippling off a glimmering stream.  That's how the song makes me feel.  The transitions between verses are phenomenal and Enya's voice is the perfect complement to this creative and intrinsically original concept.  The world is a beautiful place ;-) A truly majestic song...
1	Wanted the version by garrett kato.
1	I come at this album from a different direction.. Mumford & Sons' earlier albums are great, but I'm a fan of a larger sound, like Boxer Rebellion, Coldplay, etc. This album to me is a true 5-star. From end to end it's great lyrics, melodies, beats, emotions, sounds.... Fantastic. Maybe most Mumford fans are like Dylan fans or Indigo Girl fans who wanted them to stick to acoustic for the rest of their career. I'm personally glad they didn't.
1	This is like Sweet Dreams getting redone by Manson. Some songs were just meant to be sung mean. This is perfect!
1	I really like this song and I really like a lot of stuff by coldplay.  I'm glad that I bought this.
0	Skips every other bar. Need a real black vinyl version
0	Easy download and simple streaming to multiple devices.
1	Honestly this album is really disappointing. I will say to you just go back to Alaska and explore your roots again! Take care!
1	When I was a kid, I loved video games and TRON was the perfect movie that accented my love.  I remember having the soundtrack on cassette to the point I wore it out.  Wendy Carlos synthesizer fueled scores were great...  Flashforward to now.  I am still over enthusiastic about the movie and when I hear DAF PUNK was doing the sound track, I was sold.  But the drawback was the score sounded like Batman Begins...but I prayed, sight unseen, that there would be more 'PUNK mixed it with some heavy sythesizers and...nay my friends....  Its a good sound track and I think its "original" to TRON.  Awesome Tracks: 8  The Game has Changed. 12 End of Line 13 DEREZZED.  I hope this helps some.
0	Randy Cornor is an amazing guitarist, and this mid-1970s album is a snapshot of his ability at an early stage of his career. This album would be appreciated by all aspiring guitarists, as well any fan of country music.
1	Nice mellow tune from L.P.
1	I love the first album.  This album is a horrible one.  I don't know what he was thinking on this one.
1	great
1	The download didn't come in very good!! Not very clear! Some static! I don't know if it's my computer or from where it originally came from.
0	I chose 5 stars, because it's worthy of this and more. Ronnie James Dio as the front man for Black Sabbath rocked.  He will be missed but the legend lives on in his music.
0	Excellent song
0	what are the tracks on this cd?
1	The subway is a major experience in European major cities and a rather unique one of waiting and then shooting through the tube in a silence of noise and thought. This song captures something of all that.
0	This is not even the correct song that is advertised. Waste of money!! I would not even waste your time buying this!
0	It did not sound the original.
1	Sanjaya is probably a very nice guy, but he can't sing. There is no point in being rude or nasty regarding this track, but I was hoping that maybe he would surprise us and really have something here. I was disappointed however. I would not buy this track. If this was supposed to be the best example of his album, I'm afraid I will have to pass it by. If you are out there and reading this Sanjaya, please don't take offense. You're a great guy, but maybe you should rethink the singing career. Best wishes.
1	Good We can't wait for her voice to mature and see more of her
0	Disappointed...they can do better
1	music is not same as on tv
0	I liked their previous albums and I was looking forward to Crusade but I am pretty disappointed. Musically I tend to like it, but the lyrics are soooo bad it is hard to listen to. First off, buy a new newspaper guys, writing songs about Matthew Shepard, Andrea Yates, and Amadou Diallo is not exactly topical. If you are going to write a politically charged album try and stay current. Also, alot of the lyrics sound contrived and just plain cheesy for lack of a better word (Anthem comes to mind as does To the Rats). Speaking of Anthem (We Are The Fire), this is the song that really lost it for me and stared me down the road to disliking this album. It sounds like a bad Skid Row song. Overall, they are talented musicians but somebody should have proof read the lyrics before they recorded them.  ** After listening to this album over and over again it is starting to grow on me. I have to skip track 4 (Anthem) or it turns my stomach, but Entrance of the Conflagration is such a great song I wanted to give the rest of the songs another shot. The Music is great, Heafy's vocals are great, the lyrics not so great and Anthem is an insult to the rest of the songs on this album. I probably would rate this about 3.5 stars.
1	Perfect.  Not a crazy James Taylor fan, but I always enjoy this song.  I can see why he is so popular.
0	accidentally started it but didn't download - thought I had stopped since Amazon has changed to the cloud only.  evidently it didn't stop  song was for a family member and now I don't want it. (think I activated it and it is in the cloud but it stayed there)
1	One of my favorite songs, it combines thought provoking lyrics and beautiful instrumentation. Excellent use of 'traditional' instruments such as violin with modern, electric instruments. This particular cut is excellent.
1	I heard Gavin DeGraw first at an online site that previews new music. It was a little rough, but the songs and lyrics stuck with me and I couldn't get them out of my head. I then saw him opening for Sister Hazel. As a performer, he is amazing so I bought his CD there that night. He loves his fans, as he talked to me for a bit and autographed the CD for me. And when I put it on in the car, I wasn't disappointed. It's been in my CD player for a month now, and I normally change CDs daily. His music hits the heart and has captured the way so many of us feel. It's hard to believe he's only 26 with some of the wisdom in his songs. He turned down his first recording contract offer in order to grow as a musician, and if this is what he's turned into, I can't wait for his next CD. Hard to place him in a category as his music is varied, but he reminds me of Billy Joel.
0	always liked this song the quality is awesome indeed!!

0	These are just great songs! They take me back to when I was in high school. Plenty of good times to be had.
0	I work out of my home and I like to keep some background music on.  This does the trick and I like there are no melodies or words that would distract me as I am typing reports.  Great to use for meditation as well.  I sent a copy to a friend who was undergoing chemotherapy and she loved being able to listen to the CD and tune out to everything else.
0	Elvis in the Jungle right now!
1	Just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around The Starting Line came...they sound exactly like NFG...which isn't good either...and there lyrics are so boring and lame...if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyrics and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
1	Love the Memory!
0	irritating and produced the opposite of a relaxing mood. very disappointed.
1	Good song.
0	I'm so sick of ex-cons and ex-drug dealers and crackheads getting recording contracts. This is only more proof of the sleazy state of the music industry today.  I wouldn't give you one cent for this cd. I can't stand this guy's droning voice. That "In Da Club" song has been played to death by pop radio stations and on every booming car stereo driven by 16-25 year old males who think the song is cool. Anyone who thinks 50 Cent is cool needs to seek therapy at once. Why are we worshipping and idolizing lowlife thugs who should never have been released from prison where they belong?? Oh, and that's really intellegent to bring your own son to your concert and endanger his life by putting him up on the stage in a bullet-proof vest. Really smart there! In ten years when they start releasing compilation cds of rap songs from the early 2000s, they'll put a song by 50 Cent on it, and people will be saying, "Oh yeah, 50 Cent. Remember when everyone thought he was so great?"In two years from now he'll be all but forgotten while the next rap star of the moment will come along to replace him. 50 Cent is only popular now because of MTV, pop radio, and marketing. I'd rather listen to Celine Dion...and i HATE, HATE, HATE her music. That's how badly i dislike 50 Cent. Anyone who would spend money on a 50 Cent cd is stupid.
0	Because it is important to help companys know that there product is good,and that the people than will enjoy it and buy it.
0	As always, a new Third Day CD is well worth waiting for!  This is a CD that you must add to your collection!  The voice of Mac Powell is unmistakable, unforgettable and moving.  The words to the songs speak so much for all of us!  Additions of Chris Daughtry and Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf add a new great feeling as well.  "Run To You" literally made me weep!  Not to mention it is loaded with Southern Rock style.  Once again, I say...you must not deny yourself this gift from Third Day!  What a blessing!
0	Good song, by a great artist, but this version does not have the POWER in his voice that other versions do from Lee Greenwood.  Which it was the version with crashing cymbals, where he really belts it out!
0	Just God awful. 10/10
1	didn't like it. awful song. Mexican friends laughed at me for buying it. THIS IS WAY TOO MANY WORDS. SO THERE.
1	Like many of their other releases, this one has grown on me.  Initial reactions were not overwhelming, although Jubilee Street was an immediate standout.  But I've had this experience of other albums of theirs in the past as well.  In fact, it's what I've come to value this band for - they are always pushing ahead and making an effort to do something new - or in a new way.  And this challenges the listener to grow with them.  I didn't know what to expect and I find I'm surprised . . . . And can't wait to hear more.  I'm enjoying this album more and looking forward to the next one . . . . And to more surprises.
0	I am a fan of Kiefer Suthlerland as an actor and when I saw an interview with him talking about releasing an album I got excited. He explained his passion for telling stories. Be it in film or on a stage and now through music. Kiefer has expressed his avid love for music in several interviews. He even founded his own record label with a close friend to help unknown bands get heard. I know people are always ready to judge an artist whenever they cross over into another field (musician turnig to acting or vice versa) but this is a very good album. He has written the songs himself and they are very personal. Watching video clips of him touring, before ever song he explains what it's about. It's all very personal and he is a great story teller whatever medium he chooses to express it through. I hope people will give it a chance and be open to it. There are some really lovely songs on this album. I know I am enjoying his music, hope you will too!
0	great song
0	I wish to return this.  Did Not open the package
1	the white buffalo is amazing. if you have the opportunity, see him live! he is on tour often. check out his website. [...]
1	The jewel case was badly damaged in shipment, and I despaired of having a flawless product. The CD came through in perfect condition however. I have used the cassette version of this product for many years to keep me on pace during my walks. When I played the CD, I noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections, so I won't be able to use it any longer for my walks. Unfortunately, I had to open the package in order to determine this, so I'm out of luck as far as returning it is concerned!! Too bad they didn't leave a great product as it was. Sadly, it's not going to be my favorite any more.
1	Good music
1	Love this guys music & lack of regard for  Corporate Nashville  doing his own thing his own way...  Just adding  multiple songs with a BEAT & or Guitar licks to my MP3  to boost my workout endurance!  & make the experience  a tad more enjoyable...
1	I am Arminta & I have no approved this or put this up. I will be contacting Amazon to get all my old music &'photos I absolutely done want anyone to have!
1	My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening -- and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel -- is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales... but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.
1	Great variation of songs. Absolutely love everything that M Tab does! Highly recommended.
1	Of the relatively modest number of recordings of "Il Segreto di Susanna" listed on Amazon.com, this probably has fair claim to have the starriest duo of singers in Renata Scotto (Susanna) and Renato Bruson (Gil). Given that this is the only recording that I've heard of the work, it generally lives up well to the star quality of the casting. Both Scotto and Bruson inhabit their parts well and give it their total commitment, granted that the story is rather slender, almost literally much ado about nothing, even if it is arguable how much a challenge to late 19th/early 20th century social convention it might have been for a lady to want to smoke. Likewise, John Pritchard and the Philharmonia Orchestra provide a luxury carpet of orchestral backing, with Pritchard conjuring a very warm, lush and romantic sound from the Philharmonia, who play very well indeed. The recording engineers also make some effect at "sound stage" production, with Gil singing from a distance and/or off stage when that is called for in the staging, or sound effects like furniture and dishware being broken when Gil flies into a rage via his (unfounded) suspicions about Susanna, because of the smell of tobacco that he detects.  I've withheld a star, with perhaps a bit of reluctance, because of some foibles/quirks that I noted about this recorded performance, but which might not be issues with other listeners. At times, I thought that Bruson might have been overacting and overdoing the comedy just a bit. Also, the orchestral sound comes across as overly "boomy", at least to my ears.  Still, those are modest concerns.  Overall, this is a very fine recording of this ultimately light-hearted one-acter, and is eminently worth a listen.
1	LUSH LIFE follows in the footsteps of WHAT'S NEW, more post WWII standards and jazz classics. The CD is worth the price alone for her captivating performance, and one of the best versions I've heard of "Skylark". LUSH LIFE once again shows Ronstadt as the interpreter, she ranges from playful and sassy to romantic. LUSH LIFE has more uptempo numbers than WHAT'S NEW did, but she sounds at ease with the material here, joined beautifully by Nelson Riddle and his Orchestra. She also does a nice simple version of "When I Fall In Love". Other highlights include "Mean To me", "You Took Advantage of me", "I'm A Fool To Want You" and "Lush Life". Go out and get it!
0	Really gets you to thinking about how God has changed your life.  Love to listen to it; in good times and bad times .
0	I absolutely love this music! It is so beautiful that it elevates me to a blissful joyful resonance. It goes deeply to the level of my soul, relaxing while imprinting new realizations of my own harmonious alignment with the Divine.
0	Old school
0	Ok
1	I think the headline says it all! This is Rihanna's best song and one of the few songs I can replay 5,000x and not grow tired of it. She really shows a depth here that's evident of her growth as an artist. Should seriously win a Grammy for this! Amazing.
0	Definitely not even close to my expectations. If I only had a "do over", I would. 1 star says it all...
1	some sound distortion noted on my C.D. that I found unpleasant (not present when I listen to other C.D.'s)
0	Love it.  Fun lyrics for Christmastime.
1	Mighty debut from Philadelphia bandgargantuan walls of powerhouse shoegaze guitar-roar  shake and rumble while dreamy vocal strains float through the rooms like celestial ghosts  surrounded by 1000 devils with amps turned past 11.  Feedback and distortion flex their muscle  and hold hands with oscillating & flirtatious melody lines, building a marriage of opposites that  melds in a tenaciously integrated, deceptively natural soundscape.  The press release accurately  describes them as a mix of My Bloody Valentine & Jesu.  Add bits of Slowdive, Whirr, Cheatahs,  We Were Promised Jetpacks, Jesus & Mary Chain, Hookworms and Sonic Youth, and youve  got something special.  Guilty of Everything is a place where beauty & noise embrace like the  lovers they were meant to be.  Earth-shakingly gorgeous!
1	where has this Manson been since HolyWood? This album is amazing.
0	Liked hearing it on a holiday family road trip.  Not sure about the barking dogs in the end????  Neverther the less, Lindsey Buckingham is awesome!
1	What can I say, awesome album.
1	awesome!!! love it!!
1	Awesome product- Great company!
1	Another great Stevie Nicks song. Ranks among the top 10 for Fleetwood Mac. Recommended for anyone who likes their music
1	I certainly hope the public's musical tastes confine this "gem" to the dustbin of the easily forgotten.  If we hold our collective breath and walk faster, we'll get past this audio/video assault.  I have never written a review of this type before.  But this is so unbelievably undesirable, I feel I must make a statement.  Of course I believe that everyone should give it a listen of their own and come to their own conclusion. Thank you.
0	Wow, what a great CD. DCB shows us yet again why they are a front-runner in the worship genre. Powerful songs, powerful lyrics, fantastic production and mixing. It's hard to find things about this CD I didn't like. buy, buy, buy!! Don't burn and give away! Call it what you want but that's stealing and is robbing a brother in Christ!
1	Not as good as I expected and too much explicit lyrics.
0	I can't review the product, because the download didn't work and when I tried again, the message I received was that it was already downloaded.  So, I never got it.
0	When one tries to deliberately yet unsuccessfully steal patterns and riffs from Jimi Hendrix , Page, and Bonham it makes for a failed attempt and a butchered music effort.  Hearing the awful Kravitz version of the "Crunge" (though he titled it "Will You Marry Me" was the first signal that this ship was sinking and indeed it did.  Perhaps the ballads "I Love The Rain" and 'A New Door" spare this from being a complete shipwreck.  Most tracks are weak and ho-hum and nowhere near as good as his earlier material (1st 4 CD's) as one other reviewer comments.  Wish I could write a better review for this recent delivery but "it is what it is".  Kind of like when you order a steak at a fine restaurant you've been to before though on this occasion there's not much meat on the bone and no waiter to ring.
0	I love this song, I love his voice
1	This is a very old school sound
1	This boxed set is one of my favorite's from Jason Upton!! I love to watch the DVD when I need uplifting. If you are seeking Christian music, and you have never heard any of Jason Upton's CD's then you MUST!! If you get to see him live, it is an even bigger blessing. Check out his website to find out when he's playing near you. [...]
0	Don't expect too much.  However, she was somewhat better than others I have heard. Was okay, but disappointing. So-So client
0	Love Love Love this album. Was used but came in perfect condition.
1	I have been following this Band since they were under the Name of Sugar Daddy Superstar. If you are looking for a sound with an edge similar to Crossfade's AKA Sugar Daddy Superstar's first CD's you are out of luck and will be extremely disappointed! There are several songs worth listening too, but nothing that rocks nearly as hard as the first debut CD. This CD will not likely get any play on the harder rock stations. The Crossfade CD sounds more like another pop sell out like Nickelback.  Crossfade has really lost the very original sound of their first CD.  On the other there are several songs of honorable mention, Breathing slowly and Washing the world away. Even the more mellow songs have a different feel and sound to them.  The more you listen to the CD the more it will grow on you.  The loss of the back ground vocal sounds of the last CD is a huge loss. It has had a vast change to the Sound of Crossfade.
1	I actually bought this song for someone else.  It does echo the sentiment of just wanting to go home--even if "home" is not there anymore.  Great song, done well.
1	Paul is one of a kind, a truly talented man. I enjoy hearing the tunes he created very much.
0	Awesome
1	Good song easy listening especially if you are going through things. The quality is good, easy to download to cloud player and to computer and ipod.
0	I loved the 40th anniversary Aqualung, so my anticipation was very high for this release. Thick as a Brick is one of my favorite Jethro Tull albums and I have played it hundreds of times over the last 30+ years. Sadly, the loudness wars and poor quality control have ruined this work of art.  The DVD has glitches, and when compared to the Mobile Fidelity gold CD, this re-mix's mastering sounds less dynamic with the drums somewhat buried and the cymbals have a harsh, unnatural, irritating quality which I find to be fatiguing. Ian Anderson's vocals have been brought forward and the treble boost that degrades the cymbals has added a bit of an unpleasant sharp edge to his voice. Warmth and deep bass are also nonexistent.  The Aqualung 40th Anniversary CD was a revelation due to the tremendous improvement in clarity, texture, and space added to the sound. None of this is true with this release of Thick as a Brick.  I can't begin to comprehend why Peter Mew, the mastering "engineer," felt such a need to ruin Steve Wilson's mix by squashing the dynamics and boosting the high frequencies to such an extreme level. In my opinion this is a heartbreaking lost opportunity for Jethro Tull fans.  If you have the 1997 25th anniversary remaster maybe this may sound like a small and expensive improvement over that release since it is also compressed and crispy, but when compared to the Mobile Fidelity remaster this 40 Anniversary Edition is significantly inferior.  I have returned this insulting disgrace back to Amazon and EMI.  This release is a perfect example of why I rarely ever buy new CDs. They tend to be poorly mastered and inferior to older or original releases.  UPDATE: It appears that EMI will send out a replacement DVD. The new DVD will fix the glitches on the 5.1 surround version. This repaired 5.1 surround will also be a flat transfer of Steve Wilson's remix, without Peter Mew's awful alterations to that mix. Unfortunately, those of us who want Steve Wilson's unaltered stereo remix on the CD or DVD are out of luck. The CD will not be replaced and the only change to the DVD is the revised 5.1 surround version which had the glitches, not the stereo portions.
0	This CD blew me away. It's unlike there others, in a good way. This album is worth the money and five stars.
0	Terrible music! Not at all what I was expecting for my mother! need to submit a return/gerund request
1	TOP and GREAT !
0	I grew up listening to this song. This song was the making up song of a couple who lived in the building were I grew up. Everyone knew when they fought and made up because the husband would blast that song and later laughter and giggles can be heard. That man was a making up expert lol .
0	This song will speak to anyone who has or is going through a relationship crisis. It was very moving on many levels. It made me want to download his whole album.
1	Great Music from when I was young. This was the theme to my High School Party. This brings back a lot of memories.  Thank You!
1	Loved it!!!
1	I am a long-time Pink Floyd fan (pre-DSOM).  I hate this album. It sucks.
1	Great song
0	This was a defective CD, read by my car stereo as being unreadable and by my computer as being a blank CD. CD has no scratches, looks like it has been finished but there's no way of accessing the info on it.
1	Really good
0	Wasn't what expected only liked 3 tracks my son loves it though
1	The Brothers at the height of their comeback. Jessica alone is worth the price! Warren is on fire and then the band drops dickie off at the loftiest of sonic perches to bring us back home again!
1	This free album has various artists & some songs seem like a cross between Country & Rock. Of the 13 songs kept: "Dirty mouth Flo" is sort of comical , "Gather" is thoughtful & slow , "Gotta Get Back To Forgetting You" good song & good singer , & almost kept "Merseyside" . Most songs seemed to loud & fast for my liking. Though some people may like a lot more or even less...The whole album is free so make your own decision.
0	A progressive, powerful and emotion-filled, anthem-like song that should be ranked as one of Sugarland's best.  It is more of a cross-over to mainstream than some of Jennifer Nettles' more twangy vocal songs. The live concert style video that they shot for this song featuring pyro-technic backlighting was also very well-done.  Anyway, lots of country songs talk about love.  This one asks the question - what is love, and then answers it.  And in the process, pulls off a beautiful celebration of Love in a very catchy tune.
1	na not good
1	great album, its a combination of all the good music of the 80's mixed with today's sound without sounding like douchbags or pretentious. love it.
1	I assumed this would have some variance in it, but it is the same bowl being tapped over and over, no overlapping or changes throughout the whole, very long piece. I wonder if they just recorded one gap, then repeated it again and again. There must be better meditational "music" (and I use the term loosely there as it is nothing but the ringing of the bowl -- no other instruments, no melody, no chanting, ... nada) than this. I was very disappointed.
0	One of her good song
1	I thought I was getting the earlier version...this is a re-released version...not as moving as the original IMHO.
1	So, I am an adult Jonas fan. I was led to the sibling trio by my daughter back in 2007. I have waited over 3 years for new original music from them and here it is. It was worth the wait. PomPoms is infectious, catchy and so full of innuendo I almost can't help laughing aloud. Try to get the hook out of your head. Good luck. It is an earworm of the best kind. The song is written by the brothers, Nick, Kevin, and Joe, along with Paul E. Phamous. The brothers play the instruments you hear and 20-year old musical phenom, Nick, produces the song. Not too shabby for 3 former Disney darlings. The boys are now men; their music is maturing and I believe we haven't scratched the surface of their talent yet. I am so looking forward to the rest of this album.
1	Caught up in you was one of my favorite songs from the past by the band 38 special, never can get enough of the oldies of the past.
1	This CD was very disappointing.  If I'd heard a preview of it I would not have bought it.  The sound quality was very poor indeed.  I have listened to it once and I will not listen to it again.
0	It's a Brad Paisley song and with Alabama in the song as well it's a winner . i like good music and this is some
1	I love Tony Bennet but I don't like the translation of the songs, why they do this?. He is amazing in the way he sings in his language. I don't agree with the selection
1	I've never watched American Idol before, but this season was a little bit different because people kept talking about Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, so I decided to watch the Finale. I found Kris Allen is very talented singer, but Adam Lambert is a star. I downloaded this song both from Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, and honestly I like Adam's version much better. This version is forgettable and boring. Sorry!
0	I actually like his song, 'You're Beautiful', because it makes every song in this album beautiful.
1	Sounded great!
0	The beginning sounds good but of course it is just a sample just get random sounds Am I getting sort of electronic or was I getting Latin rhythm or hip hop??? just wish all these sounds were separated in different tracks
0	Awesome
1	Impeccable album! Gets better every time i listen to it. My Album of the year 2014!
1	It's an amazing remake and fantastic sound quality
1	Huge WZ and RZ here. This album is a bit disappointing. Some have equated it to an EP and I agree. I believe Rob is believing any crap he puts out there is "cool", well..... It ain't. Love John 5's playing and hope Rob puts out more serious lyrics and music next time.
1	No offense to the artists but I fell in love with Bo's singing on YouTube videos. This album was a disappointment to me in that regard. however I realize that they are doing their own music and I respect their artistry and hard work.
1	Maybe I should stay away from music while trying to sleep.  I start LISTENING to the music!  I don't think it is soothing.
0	I'm so disappointed in her, I was hoping she would make something good after the generic mess that was Unapologetic. It's okay for an album to be slow, but this album sounds horrible and boring, especially Work. It deserves to flop but it won't because her fans will listen to anything she puts out anyways. All that promo for this....
0	I caught 30 seconds of this song on the last iPad Apple commercial. Impose a very snappy. So I went looking for and managed to find it here on Amazon. Very happy songs I would recommend to anybody, that is needing a mood adjustment. Cheaper than therapy and not as permanent as baseball bats. Ha ha!
0	This file skips when I play it, and it's the only song that I've ever played from my cloud player that does this.
1	Whenever I find it hard to sleep or need inspiration, I listen to this and always feel calmer and more inspired.
1	This song has such a dark history and a dark tone. I love how sad it is and yet how beautiful it is. Sarah Brightman's voice never dissapoints though and it is as beautiful as ever. Soft and melodic yet has this strangely raspy tone. It's hard to describe her voice but it's truly amazing. This song is slow and if you're having a bad day is a wonderful listen if you want to feel even sadder.
1	I love this song. I had to buy it. Played it nonstop all day for a while
0	Great collection of assorted b-sides and unreleased songs
0	Yes
0	This selection starts out sounding like moose mating, then expands to multiple moose apparently cheering them on.  It then transitions to what has to be a clothes dryer with bad bearings (accounting for the metallic screechy/scratchy sounds) that is tumbling a large tennis shoe.  That same repetitious sound goes on (and on, and on, and on) for long enough that a real tennis shoe would have time to actually dry.
0	Taylor Swift is at a career peak right now.  She can sell massive quantities of anything with her name on it.  And justifiably so.  She is a prodigous talent.  So why gouge her fans with a "Deluxe" edition like this?  Three "bonus" tracks for $30, almost 3 times the prices of the original album's 16 tracks.  These tactics really burn completists who bought her latest release when it first came out.  Good will only goes so far...
1	This is one of my favorite TAN albums. I think this album really showcases who they are and what kind of message they are trying to say.
1	Honestly, this song is so quick & fun! The Veronicas do a fantastic job with it. I love it because of the memories I have attached to the song, but it's fantastic either way!
0	Fantastic collection.
0	I have a confession to make: I've never played Final Fantasy.  Although I've owned virtually every console that the game has been featured on, including the Super Nintendo, and Playstation's one through three, I've yet to play a single minute of a single game.  I've never been one who was into RPG's to start with, plus I don't have the patience or attention span, I don't believe, to sit and pay attention and keep track of all the potions and spells and stuff like that.  I was always more prone to liking fighting games or God of War type hack/slace games.  Basically give me a few weapons and let me tear up some monsters/demons/bad guys is my motto.  So when I heard my man Mega Ran was going to be putting out an album based on Final Fantasy VII I was interested, but not entirely sold on it.  Mega Ran's already proven that he can unleash some creativity when it comes to his music, as shown by Forever Famicom, the collaboration between himself and producer K-Murdock which featured Mega Ran's raps over old school NES/SNES based beats.  Now admittedly that wasn't my thing.  I bought it and supported the project -- because that's what you do with true innovative music: you support it, because the labels won't --  but I think the old school Nintendo beats just didn't do anything for me.  It was tight as hell how the production ended up, and Ran's lyricism is never in question, but it just wasn't for me.  So I didn't know what to expect.  Would it feature more of the seriousness of his "RANDOM" disography, or more to the video game "Mega Ran" discography in which it's a bit more relaxed and fun?  Well, I have to say that I feel "Black Materia" creates a proper balance between the two.  I do have to point out that this feels like an "inside joke" of sorts. More emphasis on the "inside" part rather than the "joke".  It's like when you're around people who all know a specific story and their details, so they laugh about certain things or they'll just make a veiled reference to it.  They all knowingly smile or laugh, and yet you sit there confused, but wanting to know about what seems to be an interesting story.  This feels like that at times.  As I said I'm not famiilar with the Final Fantasy series, and I have to think that if I had played Final Fantasy VII I would get this so much more.  As it stands, I absolutely love it.  It's telling this story that, that I'm assuming is the FFVII story, in each track and I'm captivated the whole time.  And since I haven't played the game or know anything about it, perhaps that's why I feel this way.  Like the old radio shows in which they'd tell stories each week.  Each week a new entry in the saga, which would have people huddled around their radios each week just waiting to hear the next exciting chapter.  That's how I felt while listening to Black Materia.  I'm wondering though whether it's better to go in blind like myself or be like seemingly 99.99% of the rest of the population who's actually played the series and knows the things that are being talked about.  I have to give it to Random here.  He's obviously got immense love for the series and this game specifically, and it is abundantly clear as you listen.  Each track a separate chapter in this story from the viewpoint of the characters.  It's truly an amazing concept album that you don't see often enough.  These days everything is sort of cookie-cutter.  There's a formula that people adhere to.  I wonder how many people actually TRULY understand that.  The artists today are striving to do the same thing that's been done.  No deviation, no wandering too far from the beaten path.  And then there are independent artists such as Mega Ran and Lost Perception that are pushing those boundaries.  That are hopping the fence that lines that beaten path, to journey off and see what's over there.  That's the very definition of the term "independent".  Awesome album, and trust me when I say you have not lived until you have listened to Don Corneo's track.  It'll make you question, in the words of the Don himself, "are you sure this game is rated for Teens?".  Standout tracks include "Don of the Slums", "Tifa" and "Avalanche" among many others.  Production is tight and well done, as are Mega Ran and the guest rappers.  Buy with confidence!
1	It usually takes me a few listens to start liking a song.  The first time I heard this...it was "BAM!"  Instant.  Gotta get this song...so I did.  What makes it even more inspiring is watching the youtube video of his song diary and a look at his home & family life.  He seems so real and down to earth.  You'd never know by looking at him that he's the father of teenagers!  Plus, he's written an essay on his speech impediment called "The Virtue of Weakness".  He has surely gone on in spite of his perceived weakness to bless this world with his unique talent.
1	only way to buy this song, either the individual or the album.  Great quality, love to preview the song, A++
1	This is not a new album from the singer/songstress Poe, this is The Playboys Of Edinburg.
0	Used it at church, great soundtrack, everything went great. I might use it again. Thank you.
1	Downloaded and enjoy very much this excellent Christian song!
1	It's different, but what could I say, that's Prince for ya!  If you like Prince, you gotta get this song.
0	Beautiful voices both lead and choir!
1	Gone a re the good old days..
1	Do I even need to explain why this receives such a low rating?  I didn't think so.
0	Love this CD
1	Does not sound like the original artist.
1	LOVE LOVE LOVE it... was I in a coma in 2005? This is an AWESOME track by Jeff!
1	I've read some reviews that trash Sarah for departing from her previous recordings. It's happened to other artists that I enjoy as well, like DARE. I just don't happen to agree with those reviews. An artist ought to be able to mix things up. If they kept repeating a successful formula they'd get trashed for always sounding the same. They just can't please everyone, so in the immortal words of Ricky Nelson, "ya gotta please yourself". I'm sure Sarah did that and I'm pleased as well, especially with the sparseness and simplicity she employed on this CD.
1	Enjoyable song.
1	Slaughterhouse's 2nd release is a big disapointment for those who actually enjoy the group. I knew "Our House"'d be garbage but still I'm impressed how bad it is. The beat selection is so awful I didn't even care about the lyrics...they trying to go mainstream, play some songs on the radio, that's fine with me but the least they should do is drop a decent album...20 tracks deep and I got the impression I've listened the same song over and over.  Point blank: if you really enjoied this garbage either you have bad taste in rap or you're a groupie/sucker who doesn't know anything about the genre...GTFOH!!!!!
1	All I really have to say about this cd is that its pop!!  It is nothing more, not rock, not punk, but pop.  If you like poppy bands that try to be rock like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan than you will probably like this cd, so go for it  However, if you're expecting REAL rock then don't bother.
1	Love the song...sentimental and emotiona.
0	I bought this and sent it to my sister , who is going through chemo/radiation for cancer...giving us all Hope!!!
0	The recent backlash this album has received from online reviewers is typical of fickle minded individuals who liked 50 one day, then hated him the next. Why is it that when a record such as 50's blows up the charts, everyone's suddenly like "Oh he's garbage...he's wack!" Get Rich or Die Tryin is certainly not a great album (in fact I would say its a rather weak album), but I feel this collective bashing of Eminem, 50, and Dre is a little excessive. I mean c'mon, Dre is still one the best producers in the game today, as Eminem is still one of the best rappers (albeit a weak producer). Let's be a bit more constructive in our criticism, k? As for my distaste of the album, I think the main problem is that 50 brings nothing new to the table. He's big on guns, sex, drugs, & violence, but so what....so were all the other dime-a-dozen gangsta rappers from the 90's. His rhyme skills aren't much to brag about, as I sometimes have difficulty understanding what's he's saying in his songs. The beats are fairly repetitive, and there's a bit too much singing, especially for a gansta record. All in all, a weak album, but not exactly one star material.
1	Because U2 is recycling sounds , nothing New' ,, their music is jus noise now ,, go make more film scores and hang up ur wannabe Sexy bootz, guys.
1	Snoop is one of  the most engaging and charismatic  artists  over the  past twenty years  however  he been on cruise control  for the past  decade plus. he has a  set formula  and its allowed him to cover  alot of the filler on his albums.always glad him and Charlie Wilson  are on this set and glad to  hear kendrick lamar  as well,  snoop  has  been there  and done this album years ago.
1	Please, enough with this ridiculous song.  Sure it had its 5 minutes of fame but seriously, who likes listening to something so repetitive?  Apparently most of you who only listen for choruses and do not buy any albums.  I bet you have your most recent purchases in your library but cannot even name the album/CD it came from.  Think about it and once your surprise wears off, how about you support your favorite artist by buying the entire album and learn the full spectrum of musical ability instead of letting radio/videos decide whats popular.
0	Colt Ford is AWESOME
1	Someone should explain to the rest of us who appreciate great quality music such as Ratt,Guns n Roses etc. Why lack of talent seems to be mistaken as musical genious?Kurt Cobain was nothing more than a degenerate heroin addict who didn't even know 3 chords on guitar and certainly could not sing. This a perfect example of people buying garbage because they are too stupid to make up thier own minds ans MTV shoved this crap down everyone's throat because it was seen as being trendy. The ONE AND ONLY REASON this genre of music caught on was because every misfit who ever wanted to be in a band but didn't have the talent to play melodic metal and other kinds of music where you have to be able to sing and play saw that you could be a talentless loser like Cobain and get a reaction! This album and this music does not have a single redeeming quality I have never understood why people got into this crap there are no guitar solos(for those of you who listen to this stuff that is something played by talented musicians like Warren Dimartini and Geoerge Lynch),no hooks or melody to the songs and the vocals are absolutley terrible. For god sake don't buy this or anything like it,instead help all of us real rockers who like having a good time support hair metal! The only tragedy to Kurt Cobains death is that it didn't occur a few years earlier. By the way I gave this one star because Amazon said I had to rate it with at least a 1. If it was up to me I wouldn't rate it as high as a pile of petrified dog sh#t.
1	I have listened to this album by Fleetwood Mac for years.  It bring back back memories from the past. I am moving to all digital.
0	Most of the quality of the soundtrack is on the level of dreamy/reverberant synth/orchestral sound design and their intelligent blending. There are a lot of repeated synth-note pulses, emotion-laden chord sequences, broad hymn-lines with added noises from orchestral percussion/taiko drums, slow moving textures with occasional dramatic buildups.  However, compared to the rich quirkiness of the original TRON soundtrack, the musical substance of Daft Punk's production collapses to almost nothing, especially on repeated listenings.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Daft Punk as such and the comparison to Wendy Carlos is of course unfair, but after listening to this for a while, I realized that this soundtrack might in fact be a major reason for the lack of emotional connection I had to the film. Things oscillate between aggressive/menacing/overwhelming pulsation and tragic/melancholic darkness. The overall attitude of this soundtrack seems to be a "trancing out" of emotions. Instead of the perceptual shocks and high density of surprise elements that drove the original TRON over the brink of incoherence, we are now made to relax and accept everything as if in a subdued emptied state of hypnosis generated by repetitive patterns. The new movie felt like it wanted to tell a story of great depth, but in the end everything appeared strangely flat and permeated with things I seemed to have seen 1000 times before. I was wondering if an aspect of this experience was due to the fact that emotional or dynamic detail or cognitively uplifting accents are blanketed under the language of comparably glacial musical minimalism throughout this soundtrack.  Definitely not in the legacy of the original, but it's of course also a matter of taste. As a music lover, I could in any case not get myself as excited about it as many other reviewers on here.  The TRON adagio made me sigh.... "Oh Tron! Where did all your gladiatorial fruitiness go!" :)
1	I have all of Natalie Grants cds; and this one I feel is her best one yet.  The music has a very upbeat and fast moving sound and also her voice sounds the best it ever has.  Buy this one even if you don't have any of her others.
1	What a great set of tunes. thank you very much for your music! I really enjoyed them. Looking forward to much more to come.
1	I got the free download of 'Boom' from Starbucks and liked it a lot. The song is great fun, very catchy, smart, and playful. I just heard it in the background of the promos for the new TV show "Eastwick", so the word is getting out. When I saw the album on Amazon I downloaded for a low price and have been enjoying it ever since.  Stay away from the video for Boom, though. I hated it. Anjulie looks terrible in it, and it is nothing like the urbane, polished, classy video I expected to see.  Despite the video debacle, Anjulie seems to know exactly who she is musically and vocally. The songs all reflect a very good feel for a number of genres, and have a old-school-updated mixed with new-production feel. Her vocal power is not Diva-Level, but certainly are perfect for her songs, and she has enough register, technique, tone, and color to more than satisfy. The hooks are huge in these songs, which are also extremely creative, often pleasantly unpredictable. She doesn't paint herself into any musical corners, and when she goes somewhere unexpected, you usually smile broadly at the choice.  You will hear a full range of horns, strings, percussion instruments, and very cool arrangements on the various tracks. I read up on her Guyanese-Indian-Canadian suburban background, but she sounds like she was raised someplace hip, like NY, Miami, or LA. (She and Utada would definitely make an interesting bill. Utada is a Japanese - American pop princess who was raised in NY and Japan and sounds like a soul-sista on her US albums).  As of this writing, I think three songs have been released as singles: Boom, Addicted2Me, and The Day Will Soon Come. The Heat would make a nice single, and really love the ballad When Its Love. No bad songs in the bunch, really, though. I play the CD all the way through and always find the songs refreshing and fun. Excellent freshman effort. I hope she can sustain it and find new levels. With her creativity, I think she has a good shot... Boom!
1	I really like this album. I'm a Tasha Cobbs' fan anyway, but I had not heard this entire. I love her style of worship!
1	Love this song!
1	Will speak to your heart and usher in the presence of God wherever you are, when listening.  Thank you.
1	Glorious beginning of a song adapted everywhere.
0	How can I get it into my iTunes? I am not used to using the Amazon player and I want it on my playlist.
1	Great music!
1	Did not really care for this collection, which I got for free. It was a realistically boring collections of stuff.
1	Gets old after awhile, much quicker than other catchy songs
1	Had high expectations. Exceeded those expectations.
1	I love this cd! Listen to it everyday driving to work! A must get, great job Bishop Jakes. Can't wait for Sacred Love Songs 3.
1	Love the songs and the sound of this group!  Could listen to it all day! For a "country" group there is so much variety. LOVE IT!
1	The volume is very quiet.
1	Ok so I'm feeling kind of stupid as I assumed that there would be an english translation to follow along with I also assumed that the visualization track would be in english. Nope none of the tracks on the cd are english none . The little booklet that comes with the CD is in Chinese and I think Tibetan. So I think to myself I'll just fallow along with the mantra I find online... well that didn't really work out as planned, there are many places online you can find the 100 syllable mantra but none of them are the version that is chanted in the CD it seems to diverge from the mantra online near the end. So there is no way you can really learn the mantra well from this CD... that is if you speak english and don't speak chinese. So for me it was a complete waste of money. Other than that it's a great cd.
1	This song bring back lots of good times that have gone by Sammi should have done more songs great job
0	My good ol' JT sounds as good as he did on Sweet Baby James! Amazing. Love the song Montana!
0	I downloaded this and "It Don't Matter To Me" because they were not on the albums that I just transferred digitally to iTunes.  My wife and I enjoy Bread and rarely get to listen to them because I only had them on LPs.  Now that I transferred them to digital format we are able to listen more frequently.
1	Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Love it. Great song. Just listen to sample for yourself.
0	I have Kabala which is also great energy. The two together are perfect compliments in maintaining a trancelike high energy.
0	This was more like a medley and his version of scatting was kind of boring. Made me think of the lounge lizard.
1	Recommend
0	Thanks
1	I bought this CD because it is supposed to reduce stress.  You listen to it for 24 minutes each day for two weeks then you move on to the next level. I listened and all I heard was static - not relaxing to me. A glass of wine is better than this.
1	Loved it
1	Great track loved the song, an excellent smooth jazz selection!!
0	Obviously Chris Tomlin has been around for a while and has long been one of the best Christian artist.  This is a consummate work for him and perhaps his best album ever.
1	I heard this from Insidious. I loved it. I found a record player on the side of the road. It works perfectly. I love this record and I show it too everyone. I would recoomend this
1	It really does send a message, l love this song if only we stop. to look out for your brother.
1	Had been a tremedous fan of Bertie Higgins when his first songs first came out.  I have his first album and it is great, both the original LP and the CD so I thought I would get a more current album.  I don't know if the recording is just really bad or if he has lost a lot of his original freshness in his voice but the CD appeared to be either a very bad studio recording or his voice is gone.  This one goes to the thrift store... a real waste of money.
1	What can you say Billy Joel!
0	Look I would much rather review a recording of say Chopin's third piano sonata than a hit from the sixties which may not stand the test of time as well as Chopin, Mozart, or J.S. Bach has. But I happen  to have married my love on 28 December 1963 - and "Oh What a Night" is a constant reminder, if indeed I ever needed one, that I am the luckiest man on Earth. Now if you and your bride were also of this same vintage year I suggest you make it your song as it has become for Elaine and me. And remember the original is by Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons - no other version will suffice. It's a great period piece and one which I believe will stand the test of time.
0	This entire series is a big waste of time and money. Most of the tracks were done much later without the original groups. Its like hearing all your favorite songs from back in the day, covered by some unknown band !! Dont buy this.
1	When I received this album, the front cover case was cracked in multiple places and the cd itself is scratched and some of the songs skip as a result of it. I'm really upset about this seeing as how this is one of my favorite albums and artists.
1	We heard this while watching fireworks on our vacation in Delaware and it gave us chills. So we had to have it.  Reminds us of good times.
0	Rated everything with stars rating but don't have time or inclination to write extensive reviews... Sorry....  Google "immigration gumballs" to see why millions of illegal latinos in America damages our society and infrastructure while not benefiting their nations of origin.
0	Phenomenal voice, piercing and melodic. Writing that is poetic and thought provoking. I very much enjoy this album.
1	Michael Buble is a wonderful singer.  This song is particularly good for my burlesque classes
1	Love the song. Good, easy download!
1	Love the beat of the song, but the lyrics, "Great God Almighty" seems a little off...especially when teaching kids not use the Lord's name in vain.
1	Love it!  The quality is fantastic!
0	This song was awesome it is grate Also it is grate for kids and if you wear beats it is better
0	I enjoy good brass and The Dallas Brass does it very well !  The CD lives up to their reputation of excellent music.  I highly recommend it.
1	Was not able to download it.
1	Love the one song... the rest not so much. But at the cost buy it.
1	love this cd.  The best of Chet.
1	Wonderful songs, but missing 1/2 the cds. Hoping seller will correct this. Really like the music - baby loves it!
0	Awesome song, and so is the Gaither dvd that it was originally recorded from!! I would recommend this song to everyone...
0	Great song, I recommend buying music on Amazon.
1	replacing old LP and cassette music with MP3 or CD.  I like the MP3 option since many CDs (albums) only contain a couple keepworthy songs.
0	Very satisfied
1	This sight is do annoying trying to buy song it won't allow me too Ughhh
1	have no idea
1	Good
0	This song is beautifully written, both in music and lyrics. You can feel the sorrow in this song, more emphasized with just a piano accompaniment. Even without other musical instruments to back Adele up, the piano made the song more meaningful and thus requires the listener to focus on the lyrics more. It has the same impact as her Someone Like You.  I find myself listening to this powerful and sad song a lot due to how well composed it is. Apparently, the lyrics was a collaboration with Bruno Mars -- who also writes good lyrics.
1	The quality of the singing was not equal to the one song I heard on Facebook.  Really disappointed with the quality of the recording. Sorry I bought it.
0	I have to admit I love a good Vampire romance and author Susan Hanniford Crowley has once again delivered a page turner of a story. Vampire Princess of New York is the latest in her Arnhem Knights series and to my thinking the best of Crowleys vampire stories  yet.  This tale features King Maxs daughter Noblesse as the strong, determined heiress to his dynasty who must journey through a complex, vivid and often dangerous supernatural world of Vampire clans to determine just whom her true life mate is and solve the mystery of what happened to her mother.  As with this authors previous Arnhem knight tales I was drawn into her story from the first paragraph, not wanting to stop turning the pages until I reached the end. If you enjoy unexpected twists, wonderful and inventive story writing and characters you won't be able to help fall in love with, I recommend this read. Its a don't miss!
1	so disappointed in CD it only has 1 song by Vern Jackson.  I really thought it was a complete CD.  Burned again.
0	I have always loved this song. Great beat and rhythm and lyrics. This was Michael Jackson at his very best
1	great song....brought back some good memories...
1	This song sounds horrible. I thought re-recorded/remastered would sound better but this is junk. Too bad I can't get my money back.
1	My son became terrified after listening to this cd.  I am not sure if the chimes in the background were new sounds.  Days later he is still affected--crying a lot and saying he never wants to do meditation again.  I am sad that I exposed him to it.
1	Great song & Kenny Rogers did a beautiful job of singing it.
1	File under: Worst Song Lyrics or  Terrible Lyrics  Listen I'm here to bash the simple pleasure of listening to pop songs. There's a certain shallowness that i associate  with being up all night, partying hard, throwing your hands in the air like you just don't care, and saying baby just one more time.  THE LYRIC:  It's too big (big) / It's too wide (wide)  [Ed: We get it.] It's too strong (strong) / It won't fit (fit)  [No, really.]  It's too much (much) / It's too tough (tough)  He talk like this 'cause he can back it up  He got a big ego / Such a huge ego  I love his big ego There ya go! This begs the question "Whose King Kong dong was Beyonce talkin bout??"

1	Jill Scott has had a share of ups and downs musically the past several years. But when it has came down to her, she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her voice sincerely flow. That is the case with Hear My Call from her Warner Brothers debut, The Light Of The Sun. She delivers a more natural tone with her ballad very intimately, unlike more oversatured divas like Rihanna and Beyonce' have made in their songs. I was pleasantly surprised with the song from Jill. It definitely is a better ballad than what has shown to brew on radio. While everything lately on radio has been so much about Lady Gaga, what Jill has is a more natural feeling with her voice. It is a better song than what she had with Shame with Eve. If you're a huge Jill Scott fan, give Hear My Call a shot.  Song: B 1/2+

0	Everything is great i can't complain
0	It did not seem like the original recording, which is what I am looking for.
0	This album is so full of cliches that he must have been smoking alot of dope making this album- you'd have to be high to think this album is any good. The lyrics must have been stolen from a highschool girls poetry notebook. There isn't one redeemable song in the whole bunch. Iwish I could get my money back from Jack Johnson- he robbed me. I've stopped being a Jack Johnson fan. Enough said.
1	Ashley's song's are great.  CD is a great collection.
0	I have been a passionate Bjork fan from the moment I saw her video for "Human Behavior."  I was literally out the door and on my way to the music store before the end of it.  I loved "Debut."  I loved "Post."  I grew to love "Homogenic."  "Vespertine" is perfect and brilliant and beautiful in every conceivable way.  Then, somehow, we began to grow apart.  I know I own "Medulla" and "Volta" and "Biophilia," but my enjoyment of them is heavily tainted by the aural teeth-grinding that is "Drawing Restraint."  I doubt I've listened to any of those CD's more than twice, though I think it might be time to revisit "Volta."  The only reason it might be time for me to revisit "Volta" is that I have a remix of "Earth Intruders" that I end up hearing fairly often, and that song is growing on me (even though it is a third-generation copy of "Army of Me").  Truly, remixes are the only possible way to salvage something pleasurable out of "Vulnicura," and that's a shame.  During the first ten years of Bjork's solo career, remixes were dessert to her CD's entree.  They were amazing and creative in their own right.  They were often satisfying and brilliant, but if they never existed, her CD's would not have suffered.  They complimented her work without ever challenging the value of the original CD mixes.  This has not been true for the second ten years of her solo career.  Her CD's have become dry bread that we are expected to choke down dry, and the remixes are the appetizer that must try to save the meal but often only seem appealing by comparison.  Her CD's have "evolved" into sonic conceptual art: expressive, abstract, and designed to challenge the conventions of pop.  "Choruses be damned!  Melody be damned!  I will sing at you for 40-50 minutes, and you will revel in my Bjorkiness."  But I do not revel.  I endure.  I am patient and open and understanding about your aspirational brilliance, but in the end, I am tired.  I am left unsatisfied and nostalgic for when our times together were good: still challenging, still unconventional, but accessible--both musically and emotionally--and clever and witty, conflicted but somehow also fun.  I will not yet abandon you, and I will keep my eyes open for the inevitable set of accompanying remixes for "Vulnicura."  After all you introduced me to Photek, Fluke, Plaid, Howie B, Dillinja, Goldie, Grooverider, Mark Bell, Matthew Herbert, and more through your choice of remixers.  You collaborated with (or commissioned) Tricky (ahem), Nellee Hooper, Talvin Singh, Towa Tei, Tim Simenon, Underworld, Dallas Austin, State of Bengal, Beck, Thom Yorke, the RZA (!), Mark Stent, and more as producers and remixers. You did remixes for Tribe Called Quest.  Could you be cooler?  Unlikely.  Will I be at your MOMA show?  You know I will.  Will I be listening to your new CD in the car, at home, at work, at the gym, while biking through the city, or while hiking through nature?  No, probably not, but I will always remember the days and weeks when that was exactly what I would do with a new Bjork CD.
1	This album is at the very least as good as their last one. I can listen to while Iam working out, taking a nap or driving in my car. It is phenominal!
1	got a  chance to  hear this  album and while  Brittany Howard  got a  nice touch on the axe and her  vocals  have moments, this album is just rather run of the mill to me.it has a  steady  groove going which is a slight noticeable different then their first album, however this album gets fairly predictable in a hurry.  there is a  throwback feel involved and yet it never quite gets thrown forward either.
0	You will never be the same after seeing this DVD. the awesome power of our God. I recomend this to everyone young and old. A must see.
1	Only 2 stars because the version I bought (69 cents) has the goofy talking during parts of the song.  I wish the preview would have made it obvious the version I bought was the "bad" one with the stupid talking.
1	Well I won't even be as nice as the previous two guys. I expected to be getting some great music from the best electronic act in history. Instead I received this... I have no idea, won't listen to it. Copyright has been infringed upon, "The"(real) Orb has plenty of albums that show the name simply as "Orb", I have them sitting right here. I've been hoodwinked, shammed,Shanghaid,bamboozled, baited & switched, double crossed & lied to. Alex Patterson & Co. should take these sheisters to copyright court. I lost good money here.
0	Wonderful music! I was previously unaware of this composer until I happened upon a broadcast of it. I was enthralled!! Still am...
1	kelly trying to make all the money he can so he can pay for his upcpming trial if that ever happens.
1	Album name and song title 'This Is How We Roll' could have easily been shared with the sound track names of 'Cruise' or 'Get Your Shine On'.  The uniqueness of Florida Georgia Line ranks up there with the greats of Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers Band.
1	Ive always loved this one
0	Iconic. Very moving. Once you have listened to it, there is no going back.
1	Very  good Material
1	What I expected.
1	Love the album!
1	We used this for a memorial picture collage and everyone loved it. It wasn't as religious as I wanted but it worked well
0	Let me tell you how I first learned of Gavin Degraw. First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Maroon 5. I saw them at the House Of Blues in Las Vegas... and Gavin Degraw opened for them. I had never heard of him, and I didn't even know that he was the singer of the "One Tree Hill Song" as everyone calls it.  Let Me Tell You.. THIS GUY CAN ROCK! It was one of the best LIVE performances I had ever seen. He can play Piano, Jam on the Guitar..and wail like Elton John when he was a young pup. THIS KID IS TALENTED!!!  My only dissapointment with the ALBUM 'CHARIOT' was that it was no-where as energetic as teh LIVE performance was, but it's really no dissapointment at all becuase I love the album.  My Wish: Let them release a live recording of one of his shows. SO GOOD!
1	I couldn't believe I didn't have this song in my playlist!  This is a classic tune and will alway get you in the groove the minute you hear the first few bars!
1	I have G.Q.'s "I Do Love You" on the 42 CD Body+Soul collection I ordered from Time Life years ago, but this song slipped under my radar :) I listen to iHeartRadio (Oldies 95.7, Milwaukee's Oldies Station) and I heard this song on the Friday Night Groove Train. It's a great song and I'm glad I purchased it. Now I'll look and see what year it came out because I don't remember this song while growing up.
0	I like the old traditional Christmas songs sang the old traditional way so I was disappointed with the sampler.  However, I'm sure the newer jazzier sounds will resonate with the younger crowd.
0	The DVD is to be discarded immediately. Amateur video. Bob's performance is OK but the video is often replaced by Windows Media Player type visualizations, probably due to unacceptable video quality (while the audio continues). There is much better video available from other concerts and I didn't even watch this one completely. What a waste of time. As one says in Dutch: een kaat kieken. (I am specialized in reggae music, and a collector, since 1975).
1	This is a great song and it was very easy for me to purchase it while I was lsitening to it on mp3 app.
1	I can't stand Adele's grating voice.
1	I remember first hearing this song on American Idol by the contestant that sang it and I heard wrote it, Bo Bice.  I remember first hearing it on the radio, it just debuted or something.  I guess it was too new for me to get the singers name, because later on that week, Bo Bice sang it, and I thought oh, he's singing that new song on the radio.  Then American Idol said Bo Bice wrote the song.  Now Gavin Degraw sings it, but that is way after hearing it on Season 4 of American Idol, with Bo Bice, Constatine, and Carrie Underwood, who won American Idol season 4. Ok, Bo Bice sang the song, which had a much harder edge.  Gavin Degraw actually did pretty well with it!
1	-  the best, these guys...
1	Terrible sound..
1	The song is composed well but it's content it's not my favorite from Disturbed.
1	like
0	I do not like this "musician" and certainly would never line her pockets with my hard eraned money.  Please reverse purchase
1	This was not what it appears to be...  It is "Martie, Emily & Natalie" from the "Bipolar & Proud" CD...  I still would hope that he actually did a version of Convoy because I would buy that in a heartbeat...
0	Best Paul Simon yet. Amazing!!!
0	Ehhh, it sounds a lot like a computer glitch. Girl singers remind me of Katie Perry with less groove and piles of Auto-tune.  I sampled the whole album to be fair. I listen to the REAL Journey during the era of Steve's, Perry and Smith, world's greatest players, especially now. Smith is one of the best drummers alive or dead.  But as a kid, it was simple stuff like this in the form of AC/DC. Cinderella, Bon Jovi. Later, I  grew into much more complex music. Namely once I finished music school n quit drinking and drugs. It might be ok for a heavy morphine drip...try Rush, Zepplin, Steely Dan, James Brown, Bobby Marley, Janis Joplin...
1	I really don't like it I only bought it because my 7 year old son likes the song. Wouldn't buy another one from them.
1	i remember this song when i was little and had to get it. it is a good song and everytime i play it people say i love this song. i can still remember the video
1	Yes, it is derivative, and in your face sections not appealing.  Stick to non-explicit, original songs.
1	The sulton of sausage recorded several hits 'back in the  day' [the 1960's], and 'A Thing Called Love' was one of his best albeit perhaps not his biggest ['Big John' probably outpaced all other works by Dean]...great words, nice melody, good presentation by Dean.  Sadly, this particular recording delivered to my device was defective.  Poor download?  Poor digital reproduction?  I do not know, I only know that it is listed as 1:59 length on my device, but the actual recording exceeds this time [actual run time 2:15], and the finishing bars of the selection are 'eliminated' making it, as far as I am concerned, a wasted copy.  I can not recommend a download of this selection...no matter how 'reasonable' the price...you will be, as am I, wildly disappointed!  Johnny Cash covered this song as well...and a great version it is[well, it is after all Johnny Cash].  I recommend placing the Cash version in your music library. While the Dean version would be a good 'historic' recording to have in your collection, the Cash version will probably be a safer investment.
1	Best cover on the album!
0	There is no question that when it has Culture Club, Boy George has been the face of what made them a brilliant 80's band. But as the success had faded, so did his work and his abuse as well. But for him to really have that success after Culture Club, it has been more bittersweet than absolutely strong, in the way that others like George Michael  had shown after leaving Wham. But nevertheless, with the very least he did have one good song after Culture Club. The Crying Game still remains one of the more-driven movie songs of the 90's that shows Boy George at heart and voice. It is a great song to listen to today, as it was back then. Now, with a possible reunion looming for Culture Club, this song is worth checking out.  Song: B+
1	I prefer the original version of Iam that does not seem to be available on amazon.com, probably need to get it from amazon.fr
1	AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.  Do The Joy - an odd track to start the album with. Nonetheless, a good indicator of the albums flow and overall feel. The song sounds like something from 10,000 Hz Legend, with it's multi-layered synth forefront and distorted voice effects. Not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least. 7/10  Love - once again, not your typical 'second' song. It holds a sense of simplicity though, and as the song progresses it turns from a basic loop into a nice, soft-like piece with a great chord progression and melody (the glockenspiel adds an awesome feel). Sounds like something you'd hear at the end of Moon Safari - especially the later half of the piece. It wasn't my favourite at first, but after a few listens it grew on me. 7/10  So Light Is Her Football - the first song to really feature lyrical dynamics. The music sounds Pocket Symphony era, with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings. I heard (or read) somewhere that this will be the second single off the album. An odd decision I believe, but who knows - maybe it needs more listens. The song seems a little bland at some points, but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view. 6/10  Be A Bee - definitely not a song you'd think AIR would produce. With it's western-like feel, the song sounds like something off a surfing documentary. It's fun but also lacks differentiation (on all fronts). It could have done with some structuring overhauling. Not the greatest song on the album but hey - that's something you'll probably be use to at this stage, right? 6/10  Missing The Light Of The Day - an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds. If you've ever seen AIR live you'd know what I'm talking about. They seem to produce some pretty funky patches throughout their set, and this song is a pretty good indicator of that. If you've heard any of Brian Eno's earlier albums you could make a comparison with this songs psuedo-alternatuve twist. Nothing overly exciting, but a worthwhile listen. 7/10  Tropical Disease - the albums longest tune and one of the best, in my opinion. Contrary to what I've mention so far with regards to lyrical absence, I've always been one to fancy AIR's instrumental tracks. I believe it takes a higher-level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience, depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical-presence. The song sounds like two turned into one. The first half is up beat and has a similar essence to Be a Bee. As it progresses it slows down into an ambient plateau, reminiscent of something off Talkie Walkie. 8/10  Heavens Light - definitely one of the albums standout tracks. It'd be right at home with the likes of La Femme d'Argent and Ce Matin La. Probably the albums most 'chill-out' number, with it's swirling progressions (especially towards the middle half) and heavenly vocal scene. My personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune. 10/10  Night Hunter - another instrumental track with a great beat to it. Cross the electronica soundscapes of 10,000 Hz Legend and add the piano-driven feel of (the majority of) Pocket Symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down-tempo-like rhythm. A great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of AIR. 9/10  Sing Sang Sung - well what can we say about this! Easily AIR's most accessible pop-song to date with an amazing effort from the boys and their female vocalist. With a musical infusion that sounds like something from a Tlpopmusik album, this number is easily one of the best on the entire album. Simple yet so effective in its delivery. There's just enough contrast between chorus, verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel. If you're going to get someone into this album, nay, AIR themselves, this might be a good starting point! 10/10  Eat My Beat - one of the shortest on the album. The song is a good break from the ambient/instrumental-driven latter half of the album. With it's brewing crescendos mid day through the piece, it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest. 8/10  You Can Tell It To Everybody - an awesome chill-out track to begin the closing stage of the album. Once again, I find myself being reminded of the later half of Moon Safari with this one. `New Star In The Sky (Chanson Pour Solal)' would have this as it's little sister. Acoustic and laid-back in it's approach, this tune is a near perfect night song. With it's distorted harmonica interludes, it's bound to sooth whatever sorrow you're experiencing and take you to a calmer place. 9/10  African Velvet - whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer, African Velvet is probably one of the most interesting tracks on the album. With it's hand-picked guitar segments, and it's front-line horn melody, it's a perfect way to close of this special album. With a smooth bass line, hinting the likes of La Femme d'Argent, Velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note. A great way to close off Love 2. 8/10  I gave this effort from AIR four stars in the end. But I'm not ruing out a higher score. It's definitely an album that needs a few listens for it to really soak in. Not as accessible as their earlier albums, but for anyone who's been hanging for a different approach fomr these French ambient-masters, your wait is over. If I could relate it to any album previously released, I'd say 10,000 Hz Legend. On one hand this album may be sour for fans of AIR's more chill-out tunes, but on the other `Love 2' has the makings of attracting a whole new market/denomination of listeners from all corners of the music globe. Give it a go and don't give up after a few listens...it'll grow on you. Trust me!
0	What a mess! Completely out of character. What's with the ditzy vocals? This effort is proof that different doesn't mean better and can often mean worse. C'mon, Jesse, stick to what you're good at.
1	I purchased the music for kids.  They were trying to learn the dance and needed the music to practice.  Great
0	Since amazon has gone to this cloud player for downloads, I found out that after the download, it won't play on my computer that I downloaded it to which is Windows media player that has worked in the past for downloads but not since they started this cloud player
0	They have no business calling themselves thrash metal. This is pure, unadulterated trashy music known as rap metal. Exodus should have replaced this band as one of the "Big Four" of thrash. This is truly terrible music.
1	Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Heart fan. First show seen was Bebe le Strange in 1980 and last one seen was RVC in 2011. Keep the current line-up for live shows. Ditch them (and Ben Mink) for other musicians regarding studio work. Please! This freakin' album (okay, cd) is WAY worse than RVC, and that was a yawner (or downer). The same old tempi, recycled swamp, delta and voodoo blues crap (mixed in with some weird stringed stuff from Mink) just doesn't cut it anymore. These women need to rock! At least go in some new, "other" direction. And by the way, Mink only truly "worked" in Geddy Lee's solo cd.
0	I love it 5 stars
1	Beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
1	I think Melissa Etheridge is incredibly talented and this album is no exception.  What I like about her as an artist is her songs about things other than love.  She has some great protest songs.  Although this album has good music, I was disappointed in the content of the songs.  They were pretty much all love/relationship songs, nothing any deeper, and really, does the world of pop/rock need any more love songs?
0	This song is truly romantic and even though I remember being 6 when I first heard it on the radio, I thought to myself, "One day I will dedicate this song to the girl I love." I did and she loved it very much.  :-)
0	Great job Jordon!
0	If only the amazing Rhino re-issues were available at this value in one place, I wouldn't have spent months biding my time, searching for each masterful release.  Oh well, here's the shrug-worthy 3rd set of Elvis Costello re-issues.  Each album is a pop gem (except perhaps for the uncomfortably slick Goodbye Cruel World) waiting to be discovered and analyzed.  I assume all the amazing tracks from the Rhino re-issue bonus discs will themselves be released (with 5-10 new tracks that we "MUST HAVE" as Costello completists) in their own, separate "Rarities" box.  Honestly, this set is nothing I will ever buy.  All the "deluxe cover art" is merely digipack design, and the exclusive tracks on the "best of" disc can always be purchased separately.  This is only for the compulsively masochistic, or those unfortunate enough to have missed the unparalleled Rhino 2-disc sets.  Considering that the Rhino 2-packs are still in stock at many Best Buys/Borders/etc. for $15, cheaper used, or at a local record store, you aren't getting a heck of a lot, except the convenience of having all the albums at once.  Honestly, the presentation of these classic albums is a real letdown.  Elvis, we still love ya, but Universal really dropped the ball on what could have been another epic series of EC remasters.
1	LOVE THIS!! Kane Brown is amazing!!!
0	You can't go wrong with this artist. I have purchased a number of cd's by Wendell B and each and everytime I a very please.  I would suggest that he come out with a DVD and I guarantee it will sell without any problems.  Keep up the good work.
1	Sometimes we do not realize our own strength. We do not give ourselves enough credit. Some things in our lives are hard to overcome but with the right motivation we can make it through. The Lord has been that strength for me and I praise Him for this song. God bless Ms. Houston.
0	I first discovered Mike Rayburn about five years ago at a midnight "showcase" he was giving at the Arts Presenters Conference in New York. It was late but he awakened the small audience of talent bookers in the room and had everyone hooked for the next 30 minutes. It was then I became a HUGE Rayburn fan.  If you don't know him, you should. He's really three guys in one. First, and foremost he is an accomplished guitar player who can play lightning fast runs and riffs. (The opening track on this CD - "Bele Chere", a Rayburn original - is an example. Next he is a complete entertainer who mixes pop culture (especially that of the 1960s-80s) into his humor. Lastly he is probably one of the best motivational speakers I've ever heard. (No you won't hear it on his CDs but he does offer a DVD on the subject.)  This specific CD is a few years old and I'm catching up on Rayburn's earlier material. It is composed of recordings made at his mostly-college appearances in the 1990s (his long haired photo on the cover belies the fact that he now has a crew-cut) and that's both good and bad. Some of great pieces here are still in his repertoire but the recordings  sound like they were recorded off the speaker systems and not direct into the sound board. There is lots of echo in his intros. Another example of Rayburn's guitar ability is in his performance of Charlie Daniel's hit "The Devel Went Down To Georgia", Rayburn goes it alone here with just a guitar to play the "Fiddle" solo and hits the target. (I was just surprised that he didn't alter the words to insert "guitar" for the word "fiddle". It would have made it complete. Despite the sound issues I'm still giving this five stars, which - in Amazon's system - means "I Love it" and I do... for the performance and fun. I'll be honest, however, and say that this should not be your first Rayburn CD purchase. I'll leave that to his "Live at Carnegie Hall" CD (you should find my review of that on Amazon as well. The  sound quality is much better - and, yes, his hair is shorter.  Now I'm off to discover the other early Rayburn CDs. An, hope that he leaves Las Vegas, where he has a nearly-permanent gig, and come to play Philadelphia, where I live!  I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

1	This is not the original Fallin' In Love we remember from Frank & Hamilton!  Do some research and bring back the recording done in the mid-70s!
1	seemed like a poor quality recording
1	I love the product,very nice!!
1	I first heard the song "Rock and Roll Love Affair" when Prince performed it on Jimmy Kimmel Live. I hated it. How could THIS be the new Prince single? That's what I remembered thinking. Then again, I wasn't terribly surprised given the wildly uneven quality of Prince's release over the last decade or so.  Hearing the original single mix (or the original extended mix, whatever - it's track one here), the tune grew on me a bit. It's just a harmless little pop rocker. It has an oddly "clean" sound - reminds me a lot of "The One U Wanna C" from Planet Earth (though not as fun).  The remixes though are kind of a waste of time. For the price of the maxi-single download, I say might as well. You're not saving much money by just getting the Original Extended Mix. The Original Radio Edit is okay too, but I stick with the longer version if I'm going to listen to it. The Jamie Lewis mixes try to turn this into some kind of a club banger, but the mild pop production of the original song doesn't lend itself well to this approach.
0	I love this EP and can't wait for her new full length album.
1	My favorite album
1	Excellent song liked and bought it even before I saw the movie .
1	Very bad DVD,not clear,poor sound
1	This sounds like a listenable bootleg.  Just watch the concert posted on you tube, same audio quality.
1	Cannot lie:  ordered this so Alexa can play it for my parrots -- they head-bob and love this interesting tune.
1	love it....
1	What is the point of digital music if it can't be downloaded on demand.  The push to the cloud is getting annoying, and I will start to look elsewhere for my music downloads.
1	Ok
1	I remember sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting for Eminem or Lady Antebellum to win the Grammy for Album of the Year. Whoever The Suburbs are, their album "Arcade Fire" has no chance at winning. They're nobodies. Twitter was exploding with "uh, who?" comments, and rightfully so.  A total injustice took place that night. Deserving acts lost to The Suburbs for the Grammy. I tried screaming at my TV, but no sound came out. I couldn't believe it.  So apparently this band is actually called Arcade Fire (weirdo name) and they have a fanbase that consists of only people on the internet, or so it would seem. I don't know anyone personally who is familiar with this group. Since I'm known as the "Music Obsessed" in my group of friends, I took it upon myself to hear this album for myself and report it back to them. Big mistake.  The vocals are so whiny, the singer named Win (more like Fail!) constantly sounds like he is on the verge of tears. Cheer up, man... it might be hard to, though, since your band is so terrible. There are like seven members in the Arcade Fire, some I believe are multi-instrumentalists, which is weird since all of the music sounds like something you'd expect from a beginner. Attempts at a "grandiose" feel are nothing but ill-fated attempts at replicating Coldplay's stunning "Viva La Vida" sound. Please spend your time & money on listening to more interesting indie bands like Death Cab For Cutie, Muse, MGMT, Vampire Weekend and The Killers.
1	It plays!
1	LOve this song!  Amazing and very touch!  I love all of them so i would love this single!  JESUS!!!! yes!
1	Workin' out yet?
1	In my personal opinion, don't waste your money, he is just not funny by himself, just not funny
1	I play just one song over and over on this album.
1	I heard this song for the first time when I needed it.  This is the version I heard.  There is nothing more I can say.
1	Contrary to the first reviewer I thought the track was just wildly distorted. I do agree with him in that even free is too expensive for this track. Hopefully these band members never quit their day jobs.
1	I love the song, but I can't find it.  Why isn't it in my iTunes? I expected it to automatically load into iTunes
1	Love Barbra and the song!
1	Miss Taylor Swift, yes most of us have wished for you to change your sound. Whether it be a little more pop, or a little more country, we still asked. Some got tired of the usual stuff, some didn't mind and loved it.  I love your old music. I love the curly hair and the clothes you wore, and the music videos that were made. I still love you as a person and an artist.  I'm only giving this album: one star.  ONLY because I do adore 'Begin Again'. That is the only song on here that even remotely reminds me of your old albums. I'm happy you wanted to change up your style, that's cool. Everyone does it. But to lose yourself entirely into other genres that just don't work with your sound, is horrible. I feel like you changed your sound completely for more fans. Maybe you should have thought about the fans you already have instead of trying to get everyone else on board.  I kept wanting to skip tracks just to find that old Taylor Swift, that old sound of yours that everyone loved or still does.  Yeah some people like or love your new album but this one just doesn't cut it for me.  I'm still a fan of yours and will probably go to one of your concerts next year, but I won't be listening to this album again anytime soon.  From a fan with an honest opinion.
1	Don't buy this CD.  The content is indeed Groove Jazz N Chill #2 unless you don't have #2. I bought one #3 from CD baby, it turns out to be #2.  I bought the #3 again from Amazon. Com LLC and thought that it won't go wrong but I'm wrong.  Now, I've three #2 on hand.  I suspect the songs are dubbed from the digital version.
1	I don't know what the heck this is, but it is NOT the original Does Your Mama Know About Me.  This is some studio version that might have been a working version before they got it right.  It's not the version I Shazamed.  This is a version where the lead singer is speaking/rapping (not the hip hop rapping) and then goes into the song.  If I hadn't looked at the song on my player I would have thought this was a karaoke version.  I am so disappointed.  This is one of my all time favorite songs ever.
1	A great song. Miley is getting all the attention that she wants, maybe a little too much. But a smart young lady.
1	This is not the original from the cd and I hate this version. this is why her career was garbage.
0	Philip Sayce is a blues-rock guitarist on a par with Hendrix and SRV -- I kid you not. The guy has MONSTER CHOPS!! The production values on this album are a bit inconsistent, but most of the cuts are very good, and Philip's playing is nothing short of remarkable. Worthy of particular notice is the slow blues number, "Wrong Place, Wrong Time." Every time I hear it, I get goosebumps. If you are a blues-rock guitar afficionado like me, get this album, you can't go wrong.
1	This one is going to have to grow on me.  There's some great songs there, but I will have to hear it several times to get comfortable with it.
1	good new recording,
0	This CD is produced by Flatrock Records, which produces the best 130-140 bpm dance music cut-ups in the industry. A mix of funk, r&b, freestyle and old-school rap perfectly cut up and mixed together. Very beat- oriented. This CD has more old-school rap than other releases (Ulticut-Ups 1&2, etc.) but if you like this style of music you will love it!
0	Not only is the volume too low on this digital download, it's chopped at the beginning and there's garbage at the end that doesn't need to be there.  The song is there, but it's not the cleanest digital download I've gotten. The quality is less than wonderful.
1	Was expecting more hits.
1	Unfortunately, this seals the deal for me that the Korn trip is officially over. Though the music by itself isn't horrible, the lyrics and performance by JD are just embarrassing. Not only that, but some vocals melodies (Pop a Pill chorus) sound like they belong in a pop song. I was really looking forward to this one - Ross Robinson producing, 24 track tape, a confirmed forth member - but no, it's just awful.
0	I love most versions of this song. I want it played at my wedding. A A A A AA A
0	This CD was a gift for my husband and he listens to it quite a bit, not only in the car but he downloaded it on to his Ipod so he can listen to it while mowing the lawn.
1	Not her best effort.
0	I fell in love with Ann Wilson the first time I heard Dreamboat Annie.  36 years later, Ann Wilson sounds even better.  Wether you are a Heart fan, or have never heard the group before, this is a must-have album if you love hard-driving rock and roll.
0	The Isley Brothers have a good sound, their music is smooth and mellow.
1	Being a KISS fan for the last 30 years, I was looking forward to this release (although I'm no longer a die-hard).  I had not heard any of the album's leaked songs prior to 10/24.  I must say I was disappointed.  Yes, it's "poppy", but what would you expect from Paul?  The thing that struck me is that it sounded out-dated.  Many songs were TOO reminiscent of that early 90s KISS sound or worse yet, Paul's 1978 solo album.  That said, it did seem to have more cohesiveness than Gene's recent solo album...YUCK...but I'm glad to have only paid $1.29 for this disc.
0	a gift no feedback or for a class ...
0	This song brings back a strange memory. This was in 1967. The Nam War was escalating. There was this young woman I was casually acquainted with. I wound up sitting in my car with her, talking to her for some 2-3 hours, trying to convince her not to send a 'Dear John Letter' to her boyfriend in Vietnam. I had the radio on at a low volume. When I was almost done with my pitch, this song came on. I turned up a little for her to hear it better. She suddenly had tears running down her, sobbing a little. She turned the radio off. She hugged me briefly, kissing me on the cheek. She opened the car door and got out. She turned around and said: "Thank you. Roger. I won't send this letter. It would be very cruel of me to do that. You see, I was so afraid to lose him. Instead, I will write him to tell him how much I love him and how much I miss him. Then I will hope for the best. Thank you so much, Roger, for rattling my cage." Then she scurried away. Ten months later, they got married, in spite of his left leg missing.
1	Tom Petty at his best, playing all his best, plus some!  These beat the studio recordings hands down.  Would much rather listen to these.
1	She is a magician on that keyboard.  Beautiful music and great selection of songs.  Recommend the album viciferously.  Also purchased other albums of this lady and have enjoyed everyone.  This is NOT elevator music.
1	What a wonderful, classy art song. Beautifully sung, with lyrics that are pure poetry: profound, emotional and - as true poetry always does - it goes to the heart of the matter, to touch our very soul.
1	Fell in love with her cover of David Bowie song Life On Mars, which so far is not on any of her albums.  This sounds similar to a overproduced teenage enya with a few catchy songs that don't compare to LOM.
1	good song for the club make you dance for sure. 2 chainz came hard jeezy killed it. they need to do a remix!!
1	This song will make you melt! Sarah's live version makes it all the more so. It is a tear-jerker! How sweet!
1	Great feeling to the music and melody... True classic. Timeless. I first heard this during a movie and sent chills down my spine.
0	I had never heard of Joy before the Grammy's on Sunday night. But I decided to support her, and download her music. WOW! She is awesome. I love it. Cool mix of rock and vocals are amazing. I hope she releases a full album soon.
0	This is my absolute favorite song for the year! It's my ringtone and my alarm clock! Everyone should download  it ^_^
1	Keyshia  Cole  vocally  has  gotten better and  that is saying something  because she is more of a  stylist than  a  actual pure singer.  problem with her is that it feels like a reality show character and  coming through her work, throughout her whole career and there is no  balance whatsoever.  the difference between her and Blige is  that Blige had better material and  balance. i don't hear any  creative growth with Cole's  music, however  vocally she has  gotten a little bit better, however a formula is established and she will be  around and probably like  Blige on a lighter scale, it will be the same ole song for years to come.
1	I can't praise David Werner's self-titled third album enough. His eponymous album from 1979 is nothing short of a Power Pop masterpiece. "Power Pop" to me defines smart, catchy, guitar-driven melodies best enjoyed on a summer drive or a day at the beach. When I think of Power Pop bands, Cheap Trick, Big Star, The Raspberries, early Nick Lowe, and The Knack. David Werner, with the three albums he released (Whizz Kid, Imagination Quota, and David Werner) fits comfortably alongside them.  There's really not a bad song on the album. From start to finish, every song is laced with catchy melodies, harmonies, and diverse instrumentation. "Melanie Cries" is a prime example. One of the few mellow songs on the album, starting with a hypnotic bass line, guitar, keyboards, and lush vocals reminiscent of The Association and to a lesser degree, the Beach Boys. The rest of the album is straight ahead rock, reminiscent of Graham Parker, Southside Johnny, with little bits of Marc Bolan and David Bowie sprinkled into the mix (especially on his first two albums).  I don't see a track listing here on Amazon, so for the record, here it is:  Can't Imagine  (3:38) What's Right  (3:42) What Do You Need To Love  (4:01) Melanie Cries  (4:50) Eye To Eye  (4:52) Hold On Tight  (4:13) Every New Romance  (5:35) Too Late To Try  (2:39) High Class Blues  (4:07) She Sent Me Away  (4:31)  Why this album never made it, I don't know. Why it's not available as a legal download in this day and age is a mystery as well. (I did see that&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/What-s-Right/dp/B004TBX0SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">What's Right</a>&nbsp;is available as part of a collection.)  I will say, however, this album has aged better than much of the music that came from the same timeframe, and preferable to what's out on the scene today. It's definately a classic that deserves to see the light of day again as an official release.
1	Another song I haven't heard in a long time and now I can listen whenever I want.
1	***************Personnel Dave Brock - guitar, keyboards, vocals Huw Lloyd-Langton - guitar, vocals Harvey Bainbridge - Keyboards, vocals Alan Davey - bass guitar, Vocals Danny Thompson - drums Lemmy - bass guitar, vocals ("Silver Machine") Dumpy Dunnell - guitar ("Silver Machine")  ***************Technical Stuff This was recorded for a BBC show called "The Friday Rock Show" at the 1986 Reading festival.  The beeb didn't record the whole set and they cut silver machine off early so it would fit in the time slot, so this album is not all of Hawk's '86 Reading set.  The recording, mixing, and mastering are all good.  So as long as you're ok with live albums, you'll be ok with the sq on this one.  ***************The Music 1986 was the height of Hawkwinds 80's straight ahead metal phase.  Simplistic beats and lots of pointless guitar braggadocio and grandstanding dominate this record.  So the songs pretty much receive a hard rock makeover.  "Hassan I Sahba" and "Assault and Battery" suffer the worst from such treatment.  Pretty much the whole album is stale motorhead-like riffing.  Heck, Lemmy even appears as a guest vocalist on "Silver Machine".  **************Summary Your attitude towards this record is going to depend on how you feel about the Hawk's 80's pop metal phase.  I don't like it, and so I don't like this record.
1	Great beat, cute song
1	Wish the whole cd were available for purchase
0	Brilliant album addresses social issues in positive light.
0	Love Jackson Browne but this was a really lackluster group of songs
0	I can't find the song anywhere even though I paid for it
1	Inspiring song,  love it!
1	ok
0	If someone asked me what song I liked, but disliked, all at the same time, it would definitely be this one. I don't want to waste anyone's time, so I'll just place it outright: take Sirah out of the song, you have a 5-star dubstep.
0	I felt like they did not know the music, as it started then stopped quite often which may have been what they wanted. Just not my type of music.
0	First of all, I am in no way a fan of 'Puppy dogs & Ice cream pop music'. But credit where it's due, Jewel can turn her hand to any style. Her voice is great on Rock songs, Opera & religious songs & Country songs so why wouldn't she take a stab at the 'Pop' market. (Just remember, that voice why she has so many fans in the first place!)   On first listen i was as shocked as any fan, comparing this noise with The Sugarbabes,Britny Spears & at times even Madonna. Her songwriting is as creative as ever but the lack of guitars is to much for me. Second spin was better.   Intuition, Fragile & Stand are the best tracks for me but I'm sure she could have recorded them as well (if not better)on an acoustic guitar.   Basically, she wants to do a pop album with meaningful lyrics. Fair enough, she's done that. But unlike every Jewel album to date, there's not a single track that made me think she had the greatest voice and range ever to hit our airwaves.   Jewel will no doubt get a lot of new fans with this new style and image. I just hope she get's it out of her system and comes back with another 'Spirit' next time around.
1	It is a scam for those who are excited and do not look at the fine print. It was incredibly disappointing that I spent nearly $20 on ONE song. I thought it was the soundtrack. Very dissatisfied.
1	Can sang his and mines face off!
1	Both this first Slinkombas album from 1979 and the follow up "...Og Bas Igjen" are among the finest Scandinavian folk I've heard. The music is equal parts stellar playing and beautiful singing. Though I'm more into the instrumental side of folk music, I was mesmerized by the vocal tracks. The Hardanger fiddle and woodwind sounds are equally amazing. Let this be a place to start if you are new to Scandinavian folk, then explore Haugaard & Hirup, Vsen, and Groupa. And don't stop there, either: there is no shortage of great folk performers in the northern reaches of the world!
1	This CD is horrible.
1	Title track/people great guitar And  band
1	If you want real music, then look no further.  You just found it! The Holland Nix, 100% Cotton album is full of earthy, rock and rythm n blues, and folk and pop music, coupled with lyrics that lend themselves to love, sarcasm, fear and even a little comedy....all of which happens without trying too hard - without trying to be anything but just music, real music. This singer, songwriter makes her own place in the world by taking what we all love about many genres of music, and molding them together to make her own style.  Whether its the jammin' classic rock sound of 'The Airplane Song' or the stripped down acoustic offering of 'Not Around', you're going to find something on this album that you love - and you'll wonder how your CD player ever functioned before the arrival of this well rounded independent release. It's now a 'must include' in my "shuffler", just like my favorite tshirt is in my suitcase for the next trip....both are 100% Cotton, and both are my favorite!  My suggestion to you is that you slip in to your own 100% Cotton - it wears like no other album!
1	Absolute greatness here.  More you listen the more epic it becomes. Notable songs would be A Damn Moment, Hate The Ones You Love, Americans, Hell Praiser.  Just get it support these guys, worth every penny.
0	Liked Len Barry &  this song
1	this album has a tremendous overall feel and mood to it.  A bit somber and melancholy yet with some pep and a back beat at times. JPW uses a wide sweep of sounds and tones to add depth to the songs.  I'd rank it up there along with other great artists like City and Colour and of course the Civil Wars.
0	I ordered the mp3 download of the Easter Song for our Praise & Worship Service to play during offering.  It is absolutely amazing!!!  Highly recommend.
1	Crap recording.
1	Arrived with case cracked.
0	The musical arrangements, playing/singing and production are very professional. I assume these are all religious chants, no lyrics are given in Hindi or in English. The compositional raag for each song is given on the back cover. There are around 15 different instruments used. The singers, solo and chorus, are all male.  I bought the album partially to hear the bansuri flute of Rakesh Chaurasia, who excels as always.
0	Not to be confused with the Rosler who was a well-known horn virtuoso and Italianized his name to Rosetti, this Rosler was born a generation later.  From what is now Slovakia, Jan Jozef Rosler (1771-1813) moved from being the director of a Prague opera company to assume leadership of the Lobkowicz orchestra in 1802.  The author of three piano concertos, six violin sonatas, numerous symphonies and operas as well as the three Op. 6 string quartets recorded here.  Written in C Major, the 1st quartet begins the opening Moderato con espressione with the first violin in the lead.  But after only a few bars the viola takes over.  And with the 2nd violin contributing a surprising number of musical ideas, Rosler immediately shows an affinity for the interior strings.  With deft interweaving of melodic lines, this lyrical 1st movement employs the top three voices quite effectively while relegating the bass line primarily to harmonic support.  By using the breath patterns of vocal phrases, the exquisite Andante un poco sostenuto creates a second section full of juicy silences and extensive rubato, while throwing the middle strings into sharp relief.  Light and graceful, the Menuetto offers the 1st violin an opportunity to shine while the subtly contrasting trio places the cello front and center.  Stylish dance rhythms propel the triple metered Allegretto grazioso. Although the spinning lead violin dominates the action, the interior voices frequently step forth into the spotlight, particularly during the fleeting episodes in minor that dot this swirling finale.  A soaring violin opens the Moderato of the G Major Quartet with the lower strings positioned in counterpoint, with a vigorous cello often in the lead.  Gentle pauses interrupt the triple metered Andante that follows, creating a dreamy landscape and causing the swaying rhythm to become nearly unrecognizable.  Rather than plump great emotional depths, the brief minor tinged passages serve to heighten tension before drifting to a tender close in this marvelously languid 2nd movement.  With an easy going but clipped attack, the 1st violin leads into the Menuetto allegretto.  As the other three voices respond, a call and answer exchange develops, first with the middle strings and then with the cello.  Smoother and more legato, the contrasting trio finds the viola and 2nd violin assuming the lead.  A perky viola starts the 4th movement, a sparkling Allegretto that features a lovely duet between the interior voices.  Amid brisk syncopation and unexpected pizzicato accents, the buoyant finale picks up intensity with the bass line driving to the concluding notes.  In A Major, Quartet No. 3 opens with a lilting Allegretto.  After the first statement by the lead violin, different instrumental configurations arise and recombine in this triple metered first movement.  A duet between the cello and viola, a solo turn from the 2nd violin, a quick trio with the upper three voices  the revolving alignments keep changing in a kaleidoscopic whirl.  From a simple, almost childlike theme, an impressive Andante con espressione follows.  Over occasional plucked accents and sweeping accompaniment, individual voices seize short phrases to create a dense tapestry of mingled lines.  After drawing to a hushed ending, a pizzicato coda in the bass line offers a whispered exclamation point.  Possibly the highlight of the recording, it is a magnificent movement.  With short excursions into the melancholy of minor, the lithe Menuetto allegretto offers a delicate respite before an energetic Allegro vivace explodes.  Elastic tempos and extended fermatas give this lively finale a spastic urgency.  Skittering violins alternate melodic lines and drive toward a rousing finish.  Recorded in 1995, the Panton issue is sharp and clear while the Stamic Quartet is in fine form.  Viteslav Cernoch on first violin and violist Jan Peruska stand out on a foursome of equals.  These are leisurely works, unfolding without high drama or sharp dynamic variations.  Even the tempos vary little, ranging from moderately slow to moderately fast with only the final Allegro vivace showing a truly vibrant flash.  But within that subdued array, they offer listeners a marvelous reward.  Born one year after Beethoven and dying a short 41 year later, Rosler was overshadowed by the master from Bonn.  In 1888, a single movement in D Major of a previously undiscovered piano concerto was published as penned by young Beethoven.  More recent research suggests that it is part of Roslers Piano Concerto Op. 15.  Whoever wrote it, that the two were linked may offer more than a hint why these excellent quartets deserve to be heard.
1	This is great cd for guests... they always want to borrow it when they  leave!  If you like the style of Jesse Cook, Liebert, Govi, etc, this is  right up with the best of their work.  A bit more relaxed than Jesse Cook  and not as well known though from the same area (in Canada), Jamie Bonk  will delight those that want something more. Recommended.
1	Ugly Love was a great song by Griffin Peterson, I can't wait for the book by Colleen Hoover now!
1	i don't buy css without track list.
1	This is fun light hearted song. It's perfect to pick you up out of a bad mood and also for just being silly dancing around.
0	I am NOT a huge fan of christian rock.  But this song is awesome.  Its great to sing along to when you are having a bad day because that's what the song is about.  She's got an amazing voice and I have to say, I purchased this song after seeing the you tube video which was downright hilarious.  Great for kids to sing a long to as well and not too churchy. :)
0	Briefly put, this remaster actually is pretty good - not sure what version or equipment the nay-sayers have to blame their poor opinions, but ignore them in my view. Here's why. I had an original Japanese pressing of this album, and took a punt by buying this anyway. I was initially pursuaded by the extra tracks and remastering claims. Then, before deciding which copy - this or the japanese pressig to get rid of, i read the reviews here on Amazon, and was alarmed by the negative, "poor remastering" reviews! So I sat down and crically listened, and compared both versions track by track. To THESE ears this version was much clearer, and better defined. Conclusion? Remastering on this seemed to work. I have kept this version and got rid of the Japanese copy. In addition, a brilliant album - always has been my favourite Huey Lewis album. Every track a winner...no filler. The live tracks as bonuses, as well as the session tracks are fun. Buy!
1	sounds too similar to last years single "problem" and the chorus part where it say "focus on me" is absolutely dreadful. This song is complete crap.
1	Marvelous as always
1	latoya should go back to porn well she's a little old and worn out for that.
0	Bought this for one song that I heard on Pandora, but like the entire album.  Very well done with great music.
0	Love this CD.  It gets better every time I listen to it, each song has amazing words, Keith's singing gets better and better.
0	Excellent
1	I absolutely love this song. It transports me somewhere else when I listen to it. I cannot speak much about other of her songs, but this one is just fantastic.
1	LOVE THIS!!!!! ...perfect condition ...many memories wrapped around this album ...thank you so much! ...would definitely purchase from again
1	Pretty good rendition.  If you like the album version, you'll enjoy this.
1	MUST See them live in concert!!
0	Good music choices.. great for making CD's to play in my auto...need same thing in"Swing" music.  Or, Smooth jazz and oldies.
1	This was a freebie with the MP3 player. But there was no problem getting it or playing it. Good deal all the way around.
1	Israel Kamakawiwo'ole......what an astounding singer.  What a great loss as his talent was lost with him.
1	I love everything by the enchanting Stevie Nicks and this is no exception. Love Love Love.
1	The musical recordings are not of top quality and I know at least one song is incorrectly labeled. Number 8 is not Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Bach. It is Chopin's Prelude in e Minor.
1	Ted Nugent.....one hit wonder.......only can keep his name out there by acting like a clown........Negents most educated word is dahhh.
1	I grew up listening to this genre of music so I figured it was time to add to my growing collection of music.
0	This is  Michael Jackson's very best song. Sit back and listen to it over and over. Sooner or later, you will agree.
0	This file is configured as just one mp3 file with all the songs compressed within that file, and your player treats it as a single music file.  Everything is played straight through without you having any control over the pieces that you wish to play or not want to listen to.  Therefore, you will not be able to toggle or skip between different music pieces within the album, nor be able to skip through the pieces that you don't care for, as you are able to do on a regular CD version that has a separate mp3 file for each music piece.  The price is great.  The music is great.  But you lack any flexibility in the order that the music pieces are played back.  If you have a short lunch break with only a few minutes left to just listen to a couple of your favorite songs, you will not have the flexibility to jump directly to your favorite pieces.  You'll be forced to start from the beginning every time and forced to listen to everything before your favorite pieces come up.  This is why this only received a one star rating.  Otherwise, the overall music is great.
1	love it
0	Nastalgic music, brings back memories. Great thatyou can pick and choosethe songs you want.blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Great thingreviews.
0	Great song! We enjoy all of her music. We have them on every device. I love amazon's ease of use.
0	FYI, these 10 songs are included on a 4 CD set by Stan Getz. The box set is called: The Bossa Nova Years (The Girl from Ipanema). Nine are on CD number 3 (with some other songs) and one is on CD 4.  The 4 CD set is on the Verve label.
1	If you like Evie you'll love this album.
0	I have been a pink floyd/Rodger Waters fan for 30 years ... I own every floyd/ water album/cd from the beginning. I hate to say this ( I really do) this CD just is not good mostly because of #1 Waters voice is gone and #2 there's nothing new  you can exchange words from pros and cons or amused with the music... It sounds like he put this together in a day and didn't care of the results. I don't like Rodger Waters music - I LOVED  Rodger Waters music and after the 3rd time of trying to find a song I like I cant ... The music its self and the musicians are good but the voice is no longer there. SORRY ALL YOU PINK FLOYD FANS (like myself) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - its better to remember the good instead of listening to this mess.
0	I enjoy listening to the song. It reminds me of the movie everytime that I listen to this song. I love it.
1	I have had insomnia issues in the past and tried many things to help.  A few months back I found a sleep relaxation mp3 from Justine Shapiro.  It helped alot so I decided I would try another one.  I am sad to say I couldn't get over the voice on this one.  There is just something about the ladies voice on this that really grates on me, so much so that it distracts me from sleeping.  It goes for 60 minutes which is a nice thing and "the voice" guides you through meditation including relaxing the muscles etc.  Try it for yourself, maybe the voice won't annoy you.
0	It's been wonderful listening to music I first heard as a youngster many moons ago.  I loved it then and moreso now.  Lucy
1	Description was 100% accurate. If my experience was any indication, you can trust this seller. I was looking for a copy of this record for a long time. I wish I could have paid less considering this is one is not in perfect condition but I'm pleased the description was accurate.
1	Every song skipped the first time I played it.
1	.99 cents??  This is worth $99!  Everyone should listen to this...men, women, and children!  It is a shame there is not more audio or text left behind by Mr. Shoaff, but luckily for us he did mentor and teach others.  One of those people was Jim Rohn.  His audio, video, and books are worth their weight in gold...priceless.  One other recommendation of a person to read and listen to is Zig Ziglar.  All of these gentlemen have passed from this world, but this world is better for their having passed here.
1	I loaned this one and never got it back so reordered.  You will love this CD.  Great background for dinner or sitting by the fire!
1	Pretty song.
1	Great Baez and fellow-folk singers. Lots of classic Baez here.  However, be careful here. If you want the re-mastered CD version  you will find that some (my) favorites like "The Horse in  the Bath Tub" have been edited out.  I'm looking for a re-mastered version of the 1959 version.
0	Through the years I have continued to enjoy Floyd Cramer's music and this is very definitely a favorite of mine!
1	With the addition of Andie Deris in 1994, Helloween had a new and improved sound overall and with Master Of The Rings we had Ande's angelic vocals and the new drummers collective talent was just what the band needed to get rid of the Queensryche clonism of Michael Kiske. Time of the Oath was a decent but underproduced album, then Better Than Raw was a Master piece, one of my favorites actually. Then in 2000 The Dark Ride, with new members changes was different but still a very strong effort from the band, and also sucessful like there prior work. With Rabbit Don't Come Easy we saw the band going back to an almost Pink Bubbles Go Ape type of album, which was actually very "laughable" in a lot of ways. This dissapointment made me wonder what the future held for the band, well now with the Keeper Of The Seven Keys-The Legacy my worst fears come true. I was expecting to actually have a song entitled the same as the album which i didn't get. Also i was expecting a darker vibe from the band, as with Better than Raw and The Dark Ride, which i didn't get. Instead half the songs sound like they were recorded during the Rabbit don't Come Easy session's, which i was very hopeful that they would lose, well they didnt. Mrs. God has to be the goofyest, corniest, lamest song they have ever done with Deris. The only song i really liked for god's sake was the ballad, Ride The Universe and its not even what i'd call "classic", its good but again a little on the cheesy side. I can honestly say that some of the songs on here are just down right horrible, with no feel, structure's or just badly written. This is the first album that i couldn't even listen to all the way through that had Deris on it. Even RDCE had some decent tracks on it. So if your a Helloween fan you may find "some" interesting music here with very bland, and often goofy lyrics, something i was not expecting from the title of the album. There is no real tie to the first 2 and i can't even see the point in calling it Keeper of The Keys. I'm not sure if its the line up change, age, or that they just have writers block, but i can honestly say this is the worst Helloween album (with Deris) that they have made yet.
1	I'm not even kidding ... just listening to the the previews gave me a headache. Enough said... If you wanna get sick this is the answer... I feel for her and her story but this just plain sucks.
0	The oritinal,  and the best rendition of his best musical.  Although I saw one on B'way with Angela Lansbury which was equally wonderful.  But this preserves the great performances of Hermione Gingold and the immortal "CLowns" singer.
0	I bought this song as a background piece for a personal video slideshow I was making.  I personally didn't want it for my music collection.  But since I now have it, I can use it for another video sometime in future.  The music and lyrics didn't fit to my theme, so I bought "School's Out" and used it instead.  The Jackson Five tune itself is fine especially since I like Michael Jackson's early tunes.
1	I've been a fan of Peter's since 2004, and love his first 2 albums.  While it's true that my initial listen of East of Angel Town fell short of expectations, I've played it more than 10 times since then, and can confidently say that it's a really great effort.  I don't want to compare it to his earlier releases because EOAT is significantly different in terms of style -- a courageous move on Peter's part considering his loyal jazz-inclined fanbase ( including myself ).  However, you can never go wrong if you have David Foster listed as a producer. He's played a huge part in the successful careers of Michael Buble and Josh Groban, and I couldn't be happier to see him mentoring Peter.  Like all of Foster's collaborations, the end-product boasts impeccable musical arrangements and sharp vocal deliveries -- standards he's famously obsessed with ( if you've seen him on American Idol, you'll know what I mean ). Of course, his OCD tendencies help ensure high quality work from everyone involved, and that is evident on EOAT.  The first time I listened to the album, I got the impression that it was >90% pop. But with each successive spin, I realize that it's actually >50% jazz -- you just have to listen more closely in order to pick it up.  Good examples include Angel Town, Be Careful, Broken Children, Always Watching You and ( my personal favourite ) Witch's Brew.  For the more pop-infused pieces, standouts include Cinderella Beautiful, December Boys, Another Falling Star ( really love this one ), and Man On A Mission ( fabulous song with a pumping jazz bridge ).  I first heard Peter perform Cinderella Beautiful, Make It Out Alive, Always Watching You and Witch's Brew at a concert in Rome back in 2005. He still had a rather boyish air about him at the time, but he's clearly all grown up now.  Perhaps Foster had something to do with this new development: Peter has matured significantly, delivering his compositions with a new-found confidence, expanding his vocal range and style to complement his tone beautifully.  There're a few nice touches here and there -- the full-bodied orchestral backup for Man On A Mission, a patriotic drum accompaniment on Goodbye Philadelphia, and the terrific harpsichord solo ( played by Peter himself ) on Witch's Brew ( perfect for the bridge, which is reminiscent of a Bach fugue ).  What I miss most, I suppose, are his piano solos, which were much more prominent on his earlier albums, and always mind-blowingly fabulous. But if you ever have a chance to watch him 'live' on-stage, the solos always make frequent appearances, so that's a huge bonus.  EOAT easily gets 4 out of 5 stars from me. I'm blasting it at top volume on my car stereo on a daily basis, and think Peter and David Foster have done a terrific job.
1	This album, the wedding album and others from this author have almost all of the same music.  I wasn't terribly impressed by the music either.
1	This album is not by the Swedish girls First Aid Kit.  It's pretty bad.
0	I study Irish step dancing and constantly look for tunes that work for timing - this tune is great fun for step and flat dance,
1	The pair with a solid reputation as a production and remixing duo has made  a comeback to revamp it's underground "Perception," which was  snapped by Sasha for his Global Underground: Ibiza CD. "Newly vocal  mix is an amazing trance excursion backed by beautiful trance rework that  washes over your soul with lovely vocal, surely denser and richer sounding  than most other progressive house/trance acts. "Perception" is  undoubtedly a long flowing track that will take you on a journey of musical  emotions with an almost dream-like feel, adrenalin-inducing progressive  sound that has been a favorite of many DJs, including Sasha, Howells, not  to mention the significant other talented and prominent figures. The new  vocal mix was also hamerred by Anthony Pappa in his set in Israel. Truly a  superb vibe that can capture the imagination. Pleasing to the ear too. Must have in any electronica collection.
0	Great song!
1	There's no reason not to love this purchase. It's a great song with great quality and I'm super excited to add it to my collection. Totally worth the little bit of change it costs!
1	This music is trash.  Not the original versions.  DO NOT BUY!!  Listen to the music first.  You won't like it.
0	What do you expect for free. Amazons MP3 music site is all screwed up.
1	Vielhuber has an excellent " oompah " band. If you like this genre of music you will love this album.
1	She just tries too hard to be enigmatic.
0	Ok, for all of you that hate this CD let me just say that is your opinon. What did you expect from a CD made for kids by kids. As for the lyrics of some of the songs, I am fine with them. Most kids don't hear the lyrics and think as we do. The ones I have seen think "I'm not that innocent" in a kid manner (being bad and getting in trouble) not in an adult manner. Both my kids enjoy listening to these CD's and I like listening with them. I knew what to expect when I bought them so I was prepared for the off key singing at times. Over all the kids on the CD did an excellent job! I say BRAVO! Encore! Encore! Let's see some of you get out there and do what these kids have!
1	These are live recordings of  Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony on the Arkadia label.  I don't know where they were recorded. It doesn't sound like Studio 8 H and so maybe it was Carnegie Hall or some unknown house in an unknown country while on tour.  There are no program notes.  The two orchestral excerpts from Psyche were recorded in 1939, Les Eolides, 1940, The inescapable Franck Symphony in D (actually, I love the work - but I have duplicates on top of my duplicates) was recorded in 1940.  "Redemption" was recorded in 1947.  The tapes have been cleaned up and so the sound isn't nearly as bad as it should be, considering....  There are no bangs, coughs, rustling sounds and weird perspectives; so the recordings probably aren't bootlegs.  Neither is there noticeable tape hiss or the snap, crackle and pop associated with old 78 records - but it's a far cry from the clean mono of the 1950s, and an even further cry from early stereo -- not to mention digital.  On the plus side: it IS Toscanini and even when he's not at his best in repertory we usually don't associate with him, he's worth a listen.  There was no cover art and no product description.  I should have known better.  Maybe they should have put a great big question mark in the product description and labeled it "classical grab bag."  LIve and learn.
0	Stereo version finally
0	Great album - so really good tracks, very few duds
1	Love Brian Stokes Mitchell, but was not crazy about this album.  Love the musical numbers he did, but it was hard to hear and understand the words.
1	The song rocks; both the male and female vocals mesh well together.  Can't stop listening to it over and over again.
0	I picked up "exclusive downloads" for what sounded like a reworked 7 minute version of the beautiful "Bo'ee".  Excited for a longer version of a great song.  Instead it is a slightly re-edited version from the "The Idan Raichel Project" album with 3 minutes of silence tacked on to the end of it (silence save for 10 seconds of a string instrument near the end).  Who does this on a digital-only release track?  Sadly, this can't be put into a playlist.
1	Let it hit billboard.  Jussie is Timbaland's new Muse.
1	One Boy is a romantic idea from a golden time in our country's history. Originally featured in the play "Bye Bye Birdie," Joanie Summers made "One Boy" into a pop hit. Too bad the lyric "to have coke with"  killed her advertising career with Pepsi Cola.
1	Awesome song to play bass to.
1	Outstanding and still going.
1	To me this song has a slight Michael Jackson feel to it that's why I'm digging it.
1	He's been compared to everyone from a young Ray Charles to a young Billy Joel, but the truth is that Gavin DeGraw has got a voice all his own.  Borrowing equally from both rock and R&B, Chariot is infused with a new sound and a new voice that's rarely heard in music today.  Just as talented a songwriter as he is a singer/musician, DeGraw is one of those kind of artists that you hear and you say to yourself, "This guy's got a long career ahead of him."  While all of the tracks on this album are great, I can't help but to reccommend my favorites: "Just Friends," "I Don't Want To Be" and "More Than Anyone," one of the best love songs to come along in quite some time.  I can't praise this album enough.  Buy it and you'll thank me (and Gavin) later.
1	I feel cheated just because it is a beutiful lyric and music. Why? Because after paying a premium price for essentially an allbum into, what I got insstead was a song and lyring with half missing. I mean only one half the song downloaed and played with the entire second verst missing. I want this corrected or refunded.
0	Everything I expected and more.
0	Great to listen to. For my daughter and the lessons through life. Also Smash Mouth Get knocked down but I get back up again !
1	This is one of the songs I listen to when I feel overwhelmed!  It helps re-energize me to take on the world.
1	Love Keith and his enthusiasm for music. Turns out I've always loved his songs, just didn't know they were his.
1	Love that her albums always have a concept and do not follow like a sheep. I like the mix but seems that they pushed to the max and the bass sounds slightly distorted. Other than that I really like it.
1	One Of The Great Songs By The Mighty Spinners!!! Takes Me Back To A Happier Time In My Life!!! Thanks!!!
1	Fast shipping!!! Perfect!!!
1	This audio CD was released in conjunction with the 100 year anniversary of the birth of Mr. Walt Disney. It has songs from attractions at Walt Disney World. The CD was produced by Disney's master audio producer, Randy Thornton. There are two version of this CD sold with the same cover art. One version was sold commercially in stores and online, and has one disc with 21 songs. There is another version of this CD sold at the Walt Disney World them park that had a second disc with only one song on it, from the anniversary celebration titled "Share a Dream Come True". If you can only find the 1 disc version that is more commonly available, you still get 99.9% of the music and I recommend it. The 21 tracks on the disc are: "All Aboard!" - Main Street Station "Fortuosity" - Main Street "Friend Like Me" - The Enchanted Tiki Room - Under New Management "Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)" - The Pirates of the Caribbean "Bear Band Serenade" - Country Bear Jamboree "Splash Mountain Medley" - Splash Mountain "Grim, Grinning Ghosts" - The Haunted Mansion "It's a Small World" - It's a Small World "Mickey's the Mouse for Me" - Mickey's Toontown Fair 10 "Seize the Future" - Alien Encounter "There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow" - Carousel of Progress "Bright Little Star" - Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe "Epcot Entrance Medley" - Future World "Test Track Medley" - Test Track "Impressions de France" - Impressions de France "Golden Dream" - The American Adventure "Hooray for Hollywood" - Hollywood Boulevard 18 "The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror Theme" - The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror "The Tree of Life Theme" - The Tree of Life "Beauty and the Bees (Beauty and the Beast)" - It's Tough to Be a Bug 21 "Fantasy in the Sky" - Fireworks at Magic Kingdom Park
0	Just wasn't as good as I expected, the songs were - strange.
1	One of my favorite beats creators love everything he does with the words and how he mixed them English and Spanish .good job
0	Great
1	I fell in love with the song the first time I heard it. I was four wheeling out in Johnson Valley and picked up a Las Vegas Jazz station on the radio out near Sledgehammer trail !  awesome song. I actually had a blank cassette sent to the station here in L.A. "94.7 the wave" back in the very early 90's and the original DJ's Kerry tombasian & Randy thomas recorded the song onto the tape and mailed it back..........awesome. alas, tapes jam and tape decks die, Thank you Amazon for making this available ! virtually nobody I know has heard of Bill Wolfer which is a shame he sure can play on this album !!! this is an awesome song !!
1	Clearly this song was intended for girls who are trying to discover what love is all about. It has a very catchy melody that sticks in your head for a while after you hear it. I recommend it to anyone its definitely worth listening to.
1	What's to say.  It's Dylan
1	Only commenting on the quality of the LP! Royksopp are awesome the music is fantastic, but after 3 different tries on the LP there no win here. The first two were covered with surface noise and were warped that last one sounds good but is also warped so I just gave up. This to me is sad as this will be thier last album and I have all of their other LP's. Clearly a bad pressing don't buy the LP. :(
1	Amazing
0	Meh
1	Awesome
1	As the last review says, the first 4 seconds of the song are missing.  I will ask for a refund, & order the song from someone else.  The first time i have been disappointed with a purchase from amazon.
0	This is the SCORE - NOT the Soundtrack.  Soundtracks have the Songs and sometimes, a bit of the Score.  The Score is usually JUST the Score - sans Songs.  I wish more record companies would get this straight.  In the case of a movie like this, the Score might be nice to have for some people, but the Soundtracks (that is, the SONGS) is what people are looking for.
1	Second Love by Collin Obremski  Mostly, this abum makes me want to cry, but I mean that in a good way.  The sad symantics of failed romance are effective at invoking empathy.  However, the abrupt changes in style seem to be an aquired taste.  Overall, the style of this album feels like light-rock, easy-listening, or coffee-house.  01 Just One Way Subject:  Rocky Romance, suspicion Top notch vocals.  02 It's Over (A.K.A.  There Really is No Reason for You to Care Anymore) Subject:  Failed Romance This starts out with nice strings.  The music has quality throughout.  However, The style of this song changes in awkward ways.  The vocals are no where near as good as "Just One Way".  03 Second Love (A.K.A.  It was great for me, but not for you) Subject:  Failed Romance Sounds like Jazz or blues.  You can't beat the nice slow piano in the beginning.  The vocals start out poor, but they improve.  The lyrics are not his best, but this song contains at least one great line.  "It's time to stop and think of all the times my hand slipped through your hair, a lasting memory we both forget to share.  "  The rhyme helps this line flow without distracting from the meaning of the words.  The imagery is provocative enough without being slutty.  04 Some Say Love (A.K.A.  It's all around you.  ) Subject:  Rocky Romance, Arguing that "love" actually exists. The music seems optimistic and happy.  The symantics seem tense, thoughtful, and a little sad.  05 Come and Free (A.K.A. No more lies, A.K.A. This is a note) Subject:  Rocky Romance, lies I love the piano in this song.  It is used effectively for communicating emotion, much more effective than the symbols or other precussion.  Unfortunately, the refrain "no more lies" is the worst abrupt change in this album.  That refrain seems to be low quality, even if you do enjoy abrupt changes.
1	Great instrumental song.  I heard it on radio 40 years after the hit TV show, but I couldn't place where I remembered it from.  It is a great traveling song.  It is one of my favorites.
1	bad audio quality - very low in volume compared to other music purchased
1	I am a huge Led Zeppelin and Robert Plant fan but I did not care for this soft noodling and boring "world music." If you like it, well that's great, it is just not my cup of tea. I do not like the direction Plant took after Fate Of Nations. For me the best stuff is Principle of Moments, Manic Nirvana, and Fate of Nations is solid. I just wish he would have stayed with a more classic sound. Even the albums I mentioned, which I do like, are really poppy and sort of 80's. If he had simply incorporated way more heavy guitars and more of a Led Zeppelin sound droves of fans would be much happier. Still I was glad to see him in the early 90's and did enjoy the show.
0	Most definitely my favorite song by Christina Perri!
0	I heard "Come Unto Me" on local college radio.  I immediately said, "What was that?" and I sought out the song on youtube.  It definitely stood out from most of the drivel on the radio today.  I had never heard of the Mavericks and I don't care for country music in general.  But I listened to this song nonstop for hours. I listened to a couple of other songs and, on a whim, bought the album. Now understand, I could not tell you the last time I bought a new album. Amy Winehouse maybe.  I buy mostly oldies, and then maybe once a year.  I don't download music either, I'm a dinosaur.  And let's face it, most music these days sucks.  I LOVE THIS ALBUM!  This album isn't "country" country.  It isn't twangy.  I hate twang.  This is more crossover country; a pastiche of tex-mex, Patsy Cline ballads, and a sprinkling of Cuban groove for good measure.  The upbeat songs are a toe-tapping put on the record and have a dance party good time.  Pull out your hankies for the ballads.  Every note of every song is brilliant, beautiful and perfectly executed.  Raul Malo may have the best male singing voice in the business and he's cuter than hell to boot.  I had to drive from LA to SFO and back. I listened to the CD all the way up and all the way back.  12 solid hours and I'm not even close to being tired of it yet.  As I'm late to the party as usual, I missed their LA appearance.  Maybe they'll be back someday and I can see them in person.  I guarantee you this album will be nominated for Best Album in the Grammy's, and should win, provided the latest teen flash-in-pan doesn't bias the voting.
0	As much as i like Lesiem, i should have read the booklets very detailed first. Unfortunetly I bought all albums "blind" since I liked "MYSTIC SPIRIT VOICES" and "ILLUMINATION" very much. But "ILLUMNINATION" and "CHAPTER2" are identical - simply another order of the songs... Also the Albums "TIMES" and "AURACLE" are the same - with another order of the songs... Maybe I am just an idiot, for not reading the booklets first - but behind a new cover and title I simply didn't expect 2 year old songs in a new order...
1	Lucky for me I already have this CD so I have no need to purchase it. It is obvious that this album is Ridiculously Overpriced
1	He's always been a talented artist, making great music and this track is no exception. Takes me back to my younger years. 5 stars all the way.
1	One of their greatest songs!
1	This is a great country dance song that will get the crowd who loves country music moving.
0	This was David Archuleta's first single. I was looking forward to hearing his recording, being that I loved his voice on Idol. His first single was amazing!! I knew it would be a hit !  It posted number 2 on billboard chart. I know David will continue to make hits, he has other amazing songs that are very popular in philipines charts and radio. God bless his beautiful voice
1	A Classic:  wonderful
1	One of these CDs came broken. I am very disappointed because I am extremely busy and never got around to returning it. smh its so aggravating.
0	The PREMIER gaming soundtrack of 2013 and beyond.  Mick Gordon is a living audio god.  Remixs of past 90s hits within the idles of the new stuff, every piece of music is a powerhouse on your eardrums.  Fighting games needs to take a deep look at the sheer span of dynamic in-song range of each of the new tracks.  And a great combo of the hits from the past.  Killer Instinct - Only on Xbox One.  THE REASON to buy that system atm.
1	Will this album ever get old?  Not for my two year old.  Sometimes it's playing when I get in the car by myself, and it's too much effort to not listen to the entire disc again and not sing along.  I know all the words.  For my kid.
1	Love this song! Great Lyrics... I created a playlist with all my 'sing at the top of my lungs' songs and this went right into it!!
1	A bit disappointed...
1	I tried to find a link to write to you, to no avail. I thought this was a CD, in which I found that after I paid for this, it was a download to a MP3 player or tablet. I don't  have any apps for this and don't know how to do it. I wanted the CD. I wanted to cancel my order, but can't find a link to write to you personally. I hope you get this message.
0	Great instrumental, also flash back from the past
1	We first bought the album back in the seventies. Singin In The Kitchen brings back such pleasant  memories to all the generation that enjoyed it then and again now.
1	This band's music can be pretty hard to find, I'm so glad Amazon has most of it up for sale.  Experimental Rock at it's best.  Body Experience Revue is such a sexy number that builds and builds itself up into such a complex frenzy that if it doesn't drive you crazy then you are insane.  And the b-side (the song I bought this for since it is not on the album) is so cool and so trippy.  It is just my flavor of weird and I will always love this band.
1	Beautifully written lyrics.  Powerful.  Music is amazing!  Love this song!
1	I enjoyed the music very much.
1	Trrrible recording of such a saced pieceof music....just talentless....the one s tar i s not even given for performsnce, but only to register this oplnion.
1	I miss 101.9 SO much.  I was there when we said goodbye with candle light in the parking lot - then it became a Spanish station the next day.  SO happy that I invested in all 3.  EXCELLENT music, well produced.  Did I say I miss this station?!?
1	If the Detroit shows too place at the Cobo Arena on May11th in the late 60's, I have a beautiful concert poster, pressed behind glass on the wall to my immediate left. Awesome!
1	This is such a good collection of Alan Jackson's music,and I was looking for 3 particular songs,and found them all on this one CD.I think that it is one of the best that he has recorded. It has line-dancing type of music,ballads,and good old country music that Alan Jackson started his career,singing. I could not find this C/D in my area,and was glad to find it on Amazon.com. The CD was a reasonable price,and in better condition than stated by vendor.
1	I love the song, but it was super annoying when Amazon says 1-Click and it takes 5 plus text retrieval.
1	Can't wait to hear her next collection!
1	Great song.  Heard it on The Voice for the first time and I found myself re-winding the DVR just to hear it again and again,  Had to have the MP3 version.
1	I love this type of music. It's very relaxing.
1	Paul Stookey has always delivered a quality product. If you are a fan of his you will not be disappointed
1	Very soothing! This is just what I was looking for and provide the refreshing sounds of music with out vocals.
0	You know this album isn't for everyone, what album is.  But I love listening to this album completely all the way through. Going from Little Smoke to Powdered Hands is time well spent each time I do it. It's great, it's soundscape, it's NOT like S/T or Quiet but so what?  Each song is different but all comes together very well and I love playing games or just driving down the highway listening to it.  If that isn't what music does for you then I don't know what else to tell you.  1) Little Smoke - A slow intro but very good and that keyboard part is haunting.  I hum it to myself without realizing it sometimes  2) Glass Realms - COMPLETELY soundscape. They just let the feedback carry the song  3) Communal Blood - The most similar to Quiet's tracks it moves a lot and centers on the guitar.  4) Reprise - Goes back to the haunting sounds of Little Smoke. They're very similar but it's extremely welcome  5) Killed the Lord - VERY different from TWDY but it also has a lot of inertia to it so it's not just soundscape.  I think "movie wrap up song" when I hear it  6) Osario - Effectively an intro to Black Dunes, very short  7) Black Dunes - Take the soundscape of Little Smoke and give it some classic TWDY love and you get Black Dunes.  This is one of the best tracks of Tunnel Blanket and it reminds me a lot of "There Are Some Remedies Worse Than the Disease"  8) Powdered Hands - My favorite track, it really makes the "tunnel blanket" of the album come alive with a lecture playing within the soundscape with descriptions of what near death experiences are (inferring the "tunnels of light" that are indicative of the title "tunnel blanket") it's right about here where you realize just how much it was worth listening to the album all the way through.  Awesome album.
1	I would give it no stars if I could
0	I used to be a John Mayer fan. This song alone has put an end to that. I'd rather have random tracks by Barney the purple dinosaur piped directly to my brain for a solid 24 hours than ever hear this song again. The one-line lyrics are nearly as appealing as a jackhammer going off next door at 1 AM except that they'll still sneak into your house over the radio after you shut the window. The music is slightly less monotonous, but nowhere near enough to salvage this train wreck. The only reason this garbage ever made it onto the airwaves at all is because it has a name like "John Mayer" attached to it. The random sing-song of your average 6 year-old produces a more meaningful and interesting musical presentation.
0	love it!
1	This is a project that I used to listen and dance to many years ago. It became a theme song to the television show "Soul Train" with host Don Cornelius. When I listen to this song, it brings back warm memories of days gone by. Days that were more carefree, less violent, more friendly.
0	I bought this only because amazon was selling it for $1.99.  I played it once in its entirety and now I forget I even have this album...Yup, its forgettable.
1	Really enjoy this group, does not disappoint.
0	I am a huge fan of Terrance Howard.  I love the music , but not the singing.  Which it was all instrumental.  Please let me know if you choose to go this route.  I will listen and enjoy your artwork on and off the screen.  Thank You
0	Very enjoyable tunes!
0	Every song features synthesizer and female vocals (I believe there are seven different vocalists featured across the 11 tracks, including Kristy Thirsk of Delerium fame). That is not to say that the songs all sound the same - the varieties in vocalists and moods are quite sufficient to maintain the listener's interest. "Falling" and "Marooned" stand out as the highlights of the album.  Though the official press Beneath the Surface calls it "a lush soundscape of electronic, acoustic, orchestral and world beat textures," I feel that the acoustic and world beat components are rather lacking. Synthesizers are very dominant throughout, with a good bit of orchestral support. The one track that does break the mold is "Marooned," which features some nice acoustic guitar.  Beneath the Surface sounds very similar to Delerium's work, with more consistent verse-chorus song structure, and no instrumental tracks. This is unsurprising considering that Bill Leeb (half of Delerium's Leeb and Fulber) had a hand in Balligomingo's creation. Despite its somewhat formulaic composition, Beneath the Surface is quite engaging, and contains some very moving songs. I strongly recommend it if you are fond of electronica, or are looking for someting in the vein of Delerium's female-fronted pop songs like "Silence."
0	The song is GREAT, butI wanted to put it on my non-apple mp3 player and couldn't get it to download.
1	No way would I pay that much money for re-mastered songs like this. I think this is priced to keep Sharon and Ozzy in their mansion! Sorry guy's, way better music out there for less money.
1	Very good album for relaxation.
1	Too used and old.
1	I really get tired of hearing this pop-dance piece all day on the radio.  It's nothing special.  PS:  Jagger has no moves.
0	I'm a hard core A-Type, alpha female, seeking her softer, balanced, less aggressive side.  I love the table of a hundred spinning plates that never drop.  Well, plates started falling and my life started to spiral and I couldn't find my footing.  Hanging out with Benita and engaging in the world of meditation really helps with getting back on my game (in a limited fashion).  You truly have to experience this CD to understand, but I hope you do.  I mean, what do you have to loose?  SB
0	I listen to her interview on NPR,  and without hearing her sing I ordered her album. Not at all what I expected country folk music to sound like.  Barely made it thru 2 songs before deciding I wouldn't be listening to it again.
1	I actually ordered both bruno mars album online and love them both, he is an awesome artist and I have listened to this album over and over many times already
1	This song haunted me for years before Google finally caught up and allowed me to search for the lyric I remembered and find it.  One of Elton's best tunes, without a doubt.
1	I was waiting for this Cd. It's not bad, but the selection of songs didn't grab me. I missed the latin arrangements as well.
0	I grew up listening to hip hop, and still listen to hip hop. I have always loved Dr. Dre and his previous two albums are classics, but this album is an embarrassment. It hurt me to listen to it. The beats are terrible, the lyrics are weak, and you can't even recognize Dre's voice. He should have quit while he was ahead.
1	Ok, so I listen to music when I am cleaning the vehicles at my job. This song played and I liked it. I said, hey this can be part of my workout music. Its so funny because the radio station that played the song said the same thing.
1	....Spoon is this generation's version of The Cars. Their studio wizardry and their catchy hooks. They don't take themselves too seriously, they just have fun playing. There's a fresh feeling on this new lp. It's more Pop oriented. Personally, I like their former efforts in this regard. There's not as much "meat" on the bones here. I really think they have lost some of their former "goodness".  Yes, they still have the catchy hooks, but I'm not as drawn into the music as I once was. Still, I like this lp. I won't be put off buying another Spoon lp in the future. The white vinyl is surprisingly Quiet! The vinyl... the outer perimeter is 'way' out of round, couple this to the center spindle hole being off center makes for some "effort" in adjusting for these deficiencies. If you love vinyl you will hate all of these things I've described. I use a Xacto knife to ream out the spindle hole in order to adjust for manufacturers defects.

0	This song is so heartfelt and relates so well to the feelings a child experiences when having to leave a school, or camp - when my daughter graduated preschool (that she loved so much), we found this song and cried as we listened to it. A week ago, my son graduated the same program - and I played it for him and we cried together. It's a bittersweet part of life to end old chapters and start new ones...and it's never really goodbye. This song is perfect.
1	This band sounds great!  Their music is inspired.  However, when you try to listen to this production of their work you will become physically ill.  The music is insanely compressed.  This sounds like the work of a first year production student.  Quite simply the worst sounding retail release (in terms of quality, not content) that I've ever come across.  Hopefully the recording sessions don't suffer from this distortion and the future will bring a remastering that will get the 5 stars that this music deserves.  EXTREMELY disappointed.
1	I am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of years ago. Delayed as my review may be it is sincere. I am a fan of Ultimate Spinach and i consider them one of the best bands of the bosstown rock scene. I had been looking forward to receiving the CD but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track. I am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris records. I suppose i should have asked them for a full refund but i somehow opted not to do it.
0	Ahh Laine! So you helped start the "Moody Blues", that we love, and Inspired Paul McCartney in "Wings"! Yes he did. Paul and Denny wrote great music together. Yeah, I should have bought this album when it first came out. I will try "Again and again and again". Is that a 'pun'?
1	sThis is a song about cheating spouses. Not my type of comfort.
0	This song caught my attention at the end of episode one of Billy Graham's "My Hope America".  It's a beautiful song with lyrics which take us from the grave to that day when we see Christ face to face.  As the music and lyrics build, we are led into powerful praise for the incredible mercy extended to us at the cross.  This will be a perfect song to be used in churches this Easter season.
0	Great
1	I buy the music not the intro
1	Awesome song-instruments and vocals are amazing!
0	Where is the original song?  Why is this crappy remix on the CD...I almost want my money back because this is a great song.  I had this disc years ago and it got lost, this was one of my favorite songs and now I am left with this piece of crap remix that is junk....don't get this song or cd from amazon if you like this song because it isn't even close to the original by demons be driven song.
0	When I first heard about this remix, I was excited. But, after listening to it, I was rather disappointed. It sounds like a cheap hack job where they took the original S&M track and laid Britney's vocals over top of it. Also, Britney sounds like she has a cold - is this what she sounds like not autotuned?
1	I'm not sure what to do. I paid for the song, but I haven't gotten it to download. Very frustrated right now!
1	Exactly what I was looking for!
0	ive tried many places to get music, the cost and the figuring out on how to download, then try to listen to song before you buy, what a joke and a hassel anywhere else wxcept amazon.conm, there so easy,yes its easy, plus its very cheap, i guess i could say? their quite awesome!! thanks amazon, for makin it easy, ans even i can figure it out!!
0	I was expecting a CD but got a vinyl. I should have read the description better but I am disappointed that I cannot get this in CD format.
1	Awesome!! Best rendition I've ever heard. Love the guitar and the challenge. Thank you, thank you MR for bringing this song to a new generation.
0	A classic from the country repertoire from one of the greatest stars of all time.  I have been adding these great hits of the past to a playlist of songs I use in teaching English in a foreign country.
1	I love this song, but realized that it cut off half way through.  I would like to know if I can re-download it without having to pay for it again?
0	Damaged and not audible, unlike the condition that was stated during purchase
1	Quality is crap. Some songs play loud others really quiet? Never had this problem with any other digital purchases from amazon.
1	It came on time & it was what I expected
1	This CD seems to include songs that weren't part of the movie. There are only a few songs I really like.
0	Classic
1	Was disappointed.  Singer over-powered the accompanying music rather than blending with it.  Singing voice was not that good.  Have heard much better Irish singers.  Would not purchase Brobdignagain Bards again.
1	Great song
1	Love this song.  Beautifully sung.  Great band.
0	man zapp was funky from the start discovered by bootsy collins and promoted by george clinton these boys couldn't help but be funky and set the world on fire cause more bounce had everybody bugging out in the 80's and one of the most sampled songs in history next to atomic dog. brand new p player and be alright is some monster funk as well funky bounce feratures bootsy baby. a funkateer ain't funkin with the right stuff if he doesn't have this in his collection.
0	She has the most amazing voice.
1	Wow, it is so funny that you are requesting reviews on this item which I purchase a while ago.  Just last night, I was trying to convert this very same cassette using my cassette converter tapes to be converted into any audio format which I like.  Of course I would very much like for this to be on a CD but I am just learning how to use the equipment and the tape now seems a little distorted in some areas.  Long story short I love this cassette by Ruby Andrews but sad to say that I have to rate it 4 stars because I cannot find it anywhere in stores like ITune or anywhere else.
0	I absolutely love this song. Liked it when Miranda Lambert sang it but like hearing Cassadee's version of it. Love watching Blake and his reaction to hearing her sing this.
1	I was not paying attention to the description! (Single ver) this was a 10th of the original 20 min length
0	best song for wordship
1	Only problem is they are recorded straight from old EDISON BEEZ WAX CYLINDERS, hardly worth the price of $9.49, and can hardly believe anyone would pay over $25 for the other two in the series. Even contemporary artist like BB and others sounded like someone ran an orbital sander over a vinyl album before they recorded it. Truly awful sound quality. Got to admit, Some great old artist.
0	After I heard Trespassing, his last album, I felt that it was one of the most beautiful albums I'd ever heard. I couldn't wait to hear The Original High. After listening to it, I am so disappointed. I don't understand how he can make this mediocre album because he's such a talented musician. I don't recommend this album to anyone unless you're a diehard Adam Lambert fan. Otherwise, I'd say skip it and wait for the next album. Hopefully, it will be good.
1	Always loved the song, her voice is gravelly good. Takes you back to the day. I get Jennifer Warnes mixed up with Kim Carnes, name only, both are distinctly good tho'.
0	My daughter wanted this, its good to exercise too..nice beat !
1	Have always liked Roy!
1	Great song
1	I think these songs might be great if performed better.  Unfortunately I haven't found any other recordings yet...
0	Great song, absolutely WRETCHED sound quality.
0	Beautiful arrangement...it was a blessing!
0	great
1	I took a gamble with this one after reading some rapturous reviews but frankly it is just boring - some of the tracks sound like Abba trying to get alternative!
1	Good quality mp3 and a good price.  Thanks
1	Best on on the album
1	no opinion
0	Very niccce
1	Very relaxing. Great to go to sleep by.
0	Great song.
1	I love this song simply because it was part of my teen years. Brings back so many memories. Love it!
1	This one of their better songs.
0	Bought the album because it had all of my favorite selections, nice orchestration but her vocalization is totally without feeling...and beautiful music without feeling is a waste..nice voice but boring ...
0	Very good CD. He has a great voice and it's so refreshing to hear a singer who can actually sing.
1	I downloaded the song, and the quality was good and I was enjoying it, and then it just cutoff in the middle of a verse.  My downloader didn't seem to have any problems, so I'm not sure what happened.  The MP3 file may be bad.
0	So So .
1	It would be helpful to see the list of the songs. Is this a re-release of the original or are there un-released versions of the original takes?
1	ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.
1	Great. Song and their music always has great messages.  I will purchase more of their music to put on my iPad
1	That Jackson Browne is turning-out such beautiful and thoughtfully-written lyrics and music, with such a powerful voice of social consciousness, earns him my high praise -- but that he has been doing so for going on 45 YEARS!! is truly astounding --and his voice is just as smooth and wonderful to my ears as ever.  Nothing less than completely AMAZING!!  I would give Jackson Browne and this album of his 10 stars if there was such a rating on this site!
0	Songs purchased through Pandora won't go straight to my music folder like they used to. Now I have to have an Amazon app. Thanks.
1	This is NOT a radio edit.  I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.  I wanted to use it for a project for my 3rd graders.  Luckily I listened to it carefully and caught the "F" word.  I wish amazon would return my $ and stop listing this as a Disney friendly radio edit.
0	This is a classic. Anyone into hard punk should give this album a try. Especially, "Good riddance" is an amazing song. Great precision and no mercy.
1	As always, the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir lead the way in corporate worship selections. This album is no exception. Any Tab enthusiast will enjoy this album.
1	Love, love Romeo!
1	This was originally released as two sepearate double CD sets and a separate DVD.  Now, here are all three products in one package.  The CDs contain about 70 minutes of studio music and two hours and 15 minutes of live music.  The sound quality is very good to excellent, except on some parts of Keys to Ascension 2, the audience is mixed in too loud.  Keys to Ascion 1 was a 60 minute live CD and the second CD is 20 minutes of live music and 30 minutes of studio recordings.  Keys to Ascension 2 is one disc of about 55 minutes of live music and one disc of 40 minutes of studio music.  To create this "complete" boxset, they just but the two boxsets as is in one package, along with the DVD of the concert.  They did not group all the live music together in the form of a complete concert or group the studio music together (which could have fit all on one disc).  The live music is from a few nights when the band just reformed.  This band is Anderson, Wakeman, White, Howe and Squire.  This particular group hadn't played together in almost 20 years and the last "Yes" hadn't played for 3 years, and they were AWHB. The group just got together and hurriedly did this concert. There was not much time to practice or innovate. So, most of the tracks come out as flat or closely matching the studio versions.  Each of the members of the band, especially Howe, have some nice moments.  But, it really feels like they are solo performers and not really playing together as a band.  The background vocals are really out of sync on many of the songs.  The Revealing Science of God is just boring and tedious. It is the prime example of how Yes (along with Emerson, Lake and Palmer) killed off progressive rock with self endulgant excesses.  The version of America is a jumbled mess. It was nice for them to give it a try, but this particular version of Yes never played it before, and it shows. Turn of the Century is just awful.  I was never a big fan of Time and a Word or Going for the One.  Starship Trooper, Siberian Khatru, Close to the Edge and Roundabout have all been done before on a number of live albums, and have been done much better. Roundabout is especially bland.  There are some high points on the is album. Onward has some very nice acoustic guitar work, but the vocals just keep droning on near the end. This song would have been fantastic if it would have been a few minutes shorter, concentrating on the great guitar moments. Many people think this is one of the best things Yes has ever done, and I agree that parts are.  I like the versions of I've Seen All Good People (with the Give Peace a Chance chorus)and And You and I. I don't think they are the best versions of these songs and they both have problems where it seems the band is a little of sync in parts.  But, they do put a few interesting twists into the songs.  The best track is Awaken, which is the only number played with any serious energy or innovation.  Some people have written great reviews about this album. But play it alongside Yessongs and you will hear the difference in energy. Another better ablum would be ABWH's An Evening Of Yes Music Plus.  As for the new tracks:  Be The One, stinks, and is about as bad as anything Yes has done. Bring Me Power is also pretty bad.  That, That Is, another 18 minute Yes opus, has some excellent parts. It is a little slow in the middle, but overall, it is extremely good. And this is a first for Yes: This is a long song that actually has something to say and the words make sense.  The other 18 minute song, Mind Drive also has some good musical parts but then some awful vocal portions.  For both songs, I edited out the bad parts and ended up with two very nice 13 minute songs.  Note on Mind Drive, the group sounds like eary Genesis at times.  Footprints and Children of Light are two very good songs.  Sign Language is a nice Howe instrumental.  Note, there is a single CD version of this album called Extended Versions. It contains most of the live tracks from Keys 1, except Revealing. It is a slimely record company trick. The music is repackaged, given a new title, so that unsuspecting fans buy music that they already own. Don't buy anything from the BMG label, as this is the sole reason for their existance
1	Nice sounds with lyrics that eat at the American heartland... not too different from the rock and rap movement of the early 90's.
1	I rate Willie Nelson 10 starts on his own, same goes for the Hag. They did some excellent collaborations in the past. But this album just doesn't gel. The song selection is not strong, the one song that stands out is "It's All Going to Pot", nice but just a bit too obvious. The recordings also suffers from being incredibly flat and boxy. It's overproduced, following modern pop standards. As Cash would likely have commented, this ain't Country by a country mile. There is also a sameness to all the songs, that makes the album ultimately entirely forgettable. It's tremendous to have these great guys still around, they're part of a dying breed. But that's still no excuse for a lame record. To any newcomers, don't judge these giants on this album! It's not even a shadow of their best work...
1	I saw Mary Poppins in the movies around nineteen sixty eight, It was a re-release and from that day on I fell in love with the song Spoonful Of Sugar, it is one of my favorite songs! At age forty-two I still love this song!
0	Deceiving ! ... must be reported.
0	like craig songs. voice, country boy. anyone in the country or small town or for anyone who just loves good tunes
1	I've read a lot of positive reviews of this album, claiming that Coheed had ripped off Rush and Iron Maiden in their previous records, and that this may be the most "them" album yet. If that's the case, then I think Coheed should go back to ripping off Rush and Iron Maiden.  Coheed are very talented, and frustratingly so. If anything, the first two albums are two of the greatest achievements in Prog Rock if you ask me. Then their third album came ad it was somewhat quite middling. A lot of good on there, a lot of decent, a lot of bad. Then the fourth, No World For Tomorrow... I don't think there were any memorable tunes on that disc. OK, I Liked the title track and Gravediggers and Gunslingers. And On The Brink was good too.  Well, with this album, Josh is gone. In comes Chris Pennie, an extraordinarily talented drummer. A nice bloke too, I met him back in October. Also returning is the lack of any memorable songs. None of the tunes on this disc would rate above a 2/5.  I actually don't like any of the songs of this disc. As I stated, the highest I can give any of the songs is a 2/5. Every track feels out of place in the cotext of the one before it. The only tune on this disc that sounds like it fits on a Coheed disc is When Skeletons Live, and even that track sounds out of place, like they had to rush in a track that sounds like old Coheed. The best tune on the album, This Shattered Symphony, Has an amazing opening and chorus, but is ruined by a totally lame part before the chorus. Same thing with Guns of Summer, despite the awesome drumming. The Broken starts off awesome but quickly falls flat on it's face. World of Lines sounds like they took the boring parts of No Prayer For The Dying, and threw them into one song.  I can't even stomach Here We Are Juggernaut, with the chorus being amazing and everything else being cringe worthy. The intro to In The Flame of Error and the chorus rule but everything else is ruined by what ruins the whole album- Coheed having interesting parts of songs, then suddenly going off into a wild tangent. Hence the "pretentious" part. They're trying too hard.  Then of course, what should be The highlight ofthe album is actually their worst song EVER, and may even be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. It is essentially just noodling around for 7 minutes. Not even the bizarre and creepy coda at the end could redeem it. Here's the thing guys. I love heavy metal. I love electronica. I love Prog. I don't love it when a band forces everything into a Blender at once, thus creating a pretentious mix that is as cringe worthy as it gets.  Also, the lyrics are disastrous. I remember when their lyrics not only told a story but were very painful and had you relating. Here they've clearly taken a step back in that department. "Rain down fire and BUUUUUUURN US AAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!" ugh, seriously? I am all for angry lyrics but this is just stupid.  Look, Coheed are much better than this. They have TALENT. They can actually write tunes. They can explore their creativity in ways no other modern band can. But this album just bores me. I sincerely hope they can make a comeback with their next disc.
0	I bought this record because I couldn't find it in the record stores.  This is an integral part of anyone's motown collection containing classics from beginning to end.  Songs that actually have messages, with melodies and singing that you will listen to for hours on end.  When this copy wears out I'm going to immediately buy another.
0	This was a huge disappointment.  Roar is the only good song on this whole album!  I guess I'm not such a Katy Perry fan after all.
1	I've always liked Lamar Campbell.  I like his style and the words to this song is awesome.  It reminds us that God has all the authority in our lives.
0	Met or exceeded my expectations. What is shown is what I received. I down loaded this and expect to listen to it often.
1	Heard it for the first time on the BBC TV Series "Luther". Loved it. So glad I could find the MP3 here.
1	The only thing astonishing about this album is that they thought I would buy it without listening to it first. Fool me twice, sham on you. Fool me 3 times and shame on me. I bought the Black Clouds and silver Linings album and it was so bad that if it wasn't for the Bonus CD with the covers on it, I wouldn't have listened to it at all. I guess that album was the black cloud and the Bonus CD with the covers on it was the silver linings? The album they released after ADTOE was so bad that I never even ripped it into my Digital collection. In fact I don't even know where that CD is or what it was called. The only thing I remember is that the PSTD song was really good and everything else was really, really bad. After those two terrible albums I started listening to everything they release on Youtube before buying it. After hearing this horrible album, I'm really, really glad I didn't waste my money on it. It's boring, uninspired and not just dull. If you want to listen to an album that reminds you of this band before they sucked, give a listen to "Her Halo" by Teramaze. It's is an awesome album. I'm really excited to hear what Teramaze will come out with next, because they just keep getting better.
0	Just ok
0	I love this song!
1	I am a huge fan of this group and this is one of my favorite songs that they have put out. When I found this song I knew I had to have it and the discounted price just made it even more appealing.
1	This CD has horrible audio quality.  I have heard better audio on the fisher price kids record player.  I like Imagine Dragons but I played this on my home stereo and thought my speakers were damaged.  Not your low end home stereo system.  Played my other music to test my speakers and I am so happy it wasn't my speakers.  The CD sounded the same in my car. I wish I could get my money back.  I do not know how these tracks sound better on the radio than off of a CD.
1	Average Performance and Recording Quality. I've heard much better performances from this pianist. He didn't seem to get this piece to bring out its true flavor.
1	Absolutely nothing like I wanted. Got a CD of baby noises. Horriblely disappointed
0	Two words- Rythm and Flow. This is the first song I've ever bought and did so to show appreciation. Thank you guys!
1	I loved this CD...had a little old time Rock a Billy feel!!!
0	I do not know how Sweet Honey does it.  The harmonies are so lovely, the lyrics so simple and yet the musicality is complex, deeply felt and endlessly listenable.
1	I wanted to love this.  The Secret Sisters can really sing and I absolutely love the way they sing harmony.  The production is good and you know without looking that T Bone Burnett produced it.  There is always a certain sound to the music that is inescapable in a Burnett production.  The problem for me with this CD is the tempo isn't varied enough; each song tends to run into the last one and the next one, and I barely noticed that it was the next song.  The lyrics are depressing to me; every song kind of brings me down.  I don't mind sad songs. I just don't like an entire CD to be filled with downbeat songs.  If they could have made the depressing lyrics sound a little more upbeat, say like Pernice Brothers, Rodney Crowell, or Josh Rouse, I would probably enjoy it a little more.  I can't really recommend this.
1	She's probably a really great artist, we know she can play the guitar, yada yada yada....but this song drives me nuts.  It's a pop song with screaming guitar - just doesn't fit.  The guitar parts sound to me like nails on a chalkboard.  And it doesn't help that it's on the friggin radio every 20 minutes.  Makes me completely not want to hear anything else she has out.  :(
1	I would have love it but the casing was broken.
1	I hope Trivium reads this.  Trivium had been the cream of the crop with their previous two albums.  Much as Metallica did in the 80's they revolutionized Metal by taking it to new levels.  The "Crusude" by no means follows the revolutionary ladder that previous works had. This album is to Trivium what the black album was to Metallica.  One that they will probably disown down the road. Please resort back to "Ember to Inferno" and "Ascendancy." Those two albums were masterpieces.  "Crusade" is a disaster.
1	My two year old was very unimpressed with this song. I think they could have made the songs more child friendly
1	One of my absolute favorites!!
1	garbage
0	Awful--definetely the kast Fish album I shall ever buy
1	I don't know why it's impossible to find the original slow r&b version of this song! I've looked on Amazon and iTunes but all that's available is this dance remix.  The backing dance beat drowns out Christina Milian's sweet tone and gone is the powerful emotion that this song is trying to convey.  Amazon needs to find the original version ASAP
0	mine
0	Great song I'm not that much into country but might be changing, ( not all the way , but will checking out) love the song
0	Good old song
1	Love jazz
1	I don't like the flute on any Fontana albums. This one has a lot of flute. If I wanted flute I'd buy "Famous Flutes of the Baroque Played on HIP Instruments" but Fontana was a violinist.
1	We purchased this for our 7 week old colicy baby girl.  She loves it.  The only problem is, it stops playing around 18 minutes every time.  I've burned 4 CD's with the same result.  Before purchasing this CD, someone else wrote a review basically saying the same thing.  I just figured it was something wrong with the purchaser.  Unfortunately there is something wrong with the download.
1	I liked the song so I bought the single.  Pretty tune and I like the words.  I'm happy with my purchase.
1	"Must have cones for seeds, must have needles for leaves, C is for conifers, that's my kind of tree." Great educational song. I bought it for my 4th grader and I was not disappointed. It sticks in your head and makes it hard not to learn a thing or two about the classification of conifer trees.
1	This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!
0	Metal health will drive you mad.
1	This is just an embarrasment. Fame has turned WK from a little known sensation into a pop media disaster. Lyrics repeat themselves, none of the beats are dope, it's just ultimately 100% a different Wiz. I persoanlly hated rolling papers because I loved all the old school Wiz from Kush and OJ all the way back to Pittsburgh Sound. So you know it has to be bad if people are saying he fell off from rolling papers cause im astonished it couldve gotten worse. Save your money on this one. Its terrible
1	I really don't do drugs (other than legal ones like caffeine), but in listening to this song again, I can't understand why I downloaded it, except for the fact it is free; but if it isn't very good, why download it?  Anyway, after listening to it a couple of times (to make sure I wasn't missing anything), I feel the song is only worth two stars, and I am planning to delete it from my ipod.  I guess everyone makes mistakes; maybe it was a senior moment for me (since I am over 65).
1	music choice allowed me to know the artist and the name of the song. i have always loved it since i  heard it years ago
1	I know what you're thinking. "It's 8-bit retro music, what does the bit rate matter then?" at least that's what I was thinking. The problem comes in that the music at times does contain some ambient and regular instrumental tunes and it does sound like garbage. Very poor quality of sound, but the music is good. Just wish I had a better bit rate copy to properly enjoy it.
1	great song
1	I'm going to try my best to keep my excited ramblings and nonsense to a minimum. Simply put, this album is completely solid. Not to mention having the album for over a year, but to love every song just as much as the first time I heard it -- especially after the heavy rotation it's been getting in my cd player as of late -- is remarkable.  Honestly, I can say that I've never been able to listen to one album as much as I do this one. After about the one-hundredth time I swear death to the CD and from there it collects a good load of dust-age on the CD racks.  But there is something about Rilo Kiley's beats, their sometimes eery, always melodious guitars -- and there is DEFINITELY something about jenny lewis' voice -- something that sounds just as beautiful screaming as it does crooning.  I have all three Rilo Kiley albums, and if you're a poor college student such as I, and even the price of $10 on Amazon freaks you out, and you can only afford one delicious Rilo Kiley album -- then I suggest this one. In MY opinion, after listening to all of their songs, this album seems to have the most amount of my absolute, have-to-listen-to-over-a-hundred-times, amazing songs on it. Stocked-full and ready to go for your listening pleasure.  5 stars, hands down, this shouldn't even be a topic of debate.
0	This is a must listen album.  There are alot of self-produced worship albums out there, but this one is definitely a cut above the rest because of:  1) Live worship recording.  This isn't a studio album with a mic and an acoustic.  This is worship music that is moving in the heart of a large crowd. You can feel the energy from the crowd and it really comes alive in your own heart! 2) Great sound engineering.  Sound quality is paramount when listening to an album, and this one does not disappoint.  Guitars, drums, keyboards, vocals.  All of them sound incredible, and the artistry is there to back it up. 3) Great songwriting.  Although this is the most important ingredient to an amazing album, I mention this last because EVERYONE seems to think "X" song is amazing, when really it's not.  This album has GREAT SONGS!  Lyrics aren't cheesey or soft, but bold and powerful.  Melodies and riffs are memorable and catchy.  There is not one "dud" on the album!  Highly recommended for all listeners!
1	This music was like a breath of fresh air, yet a throwback to melodic hard rock of the past.  I really enjoyed this.
1	Wow just terrible
1	I thought I ordered a cd and it was an album
0	Ideal for reflection time or nostalgic video montage. Two voices work so well together in a unique sound. Thanks Gungor.
0	It Rocks!!
0	This is an incredible theme song for a vastly under rated movie. This is a great version. The orchestra did a wonderful job of recreating the song. I just wish they would perform some of the other songs from the movie.
1	Buy it!
0	Just the many few of my favorite songs. Cheerful and fun song for sure. Easy to purchase on Amazon. Love it!!!
1	i can't actually attest to the full album, because i got to pistol and ejected the disc and put it down because i think that something may be wrong.  can anyone tell me if that song is a joke?  i see that it is apparently inspired by the spree killer who shot versace, but it sounds like clown shoes.  the downturn that modest mouse took with good news really circles the drain on that song, which might be an auditory representation of a poop.
0	This song is great but the version here is not the one that they play on the radio. This version lacks the same beat and intensity that the version on the radio has. I have turned the volume all the way up on the mp3 player and the car and it is still to quiet. I am not sure what the deal is with this. Still a good song but not what I thought I was getting.
1	I have heard only one song and it's beautiful cannot wait until the cd is available. The video is touching. The best gospel song i've heard all year.
0	The vocals are well produced on this track.  The instrumentation and composition leave so much to be desired for the pop music fan.  The song is lyrically poor and lacks any hook to grab the listener.  Poor,  most poor:  Though I've heard worse from Cook.
0	Heard a wonderful cover of a Dylan song and spent significant effort to identify it as Mumford's work. Very disappointed that the same simplicity was not showcased here. And, let me disclose, I am a five-string banjo player.
1	like video bette
1	this was a free download.  the music is ok. i will probably erase for more space for a better song.
1	Great
0	Love this version of this song. These guys did a really good job!!!!
1	was totaly disappointed. was not famliar with the version he sang on Mary did you know.
1	As in all of Gary Duncan's post - Quicksilver Messenger Service albums albeit a short one (approx. 40 min.), this CD never fails to please, entertain & enlighten. Falls in the same jamming vein as his old QMS. Sounds like a crisp, live all-Instrumental recording of Gary's band at their best, interpreting the Groove & Blues of the Inner City - with a T. Monk staple sandwiched in between. And as always, Gary's cool Psychedelic/Jazz Stratocaster guitar playing is at it's tastiest. If you haven't been to the Big City for awhile, this one will surely take you right there - even while you are kicking back in your easy chair taking in the beautiful Countryside. Oh, BTW ....The Native on the cover playing the Bamboo Flute isn't Gary Duncan, and is not within the tracks at all - although it would be very cool if he was. The significance of the cover pic is known only to Gary himself & his great sense of Humor. BUY !!!
1	First track (Upper World) is pleasantly spacey, good for falling asleep.  The other track (Lower World) is complete waste of time . . . just beating on a tom at a steady pace for 20 minutes.  Boring, pointless.  If you want to buy some of it, make sure to buy the Upper World.
0	This is a classic must. This music was in the film An American In Paris. Leonard Bernstein is the conductor.
1	Opus 32 is one of the most important groups of songs in Brahms' work.  Hidden shyly behind the exclamation of opus 33, Die Shone Magelone, this deeply poignant cycle (yes, it is a cycle, though purposefully not-so-named) has a deeply voiced cohesion that is simply lost on this disc, and for that matter on just about any recording of these songs.  Quastfoff fails to understand how `Du Sprischt' and `Wie bist du' are so intimately connected.    It's funny to me to hear how deeply Quasthoff cherishes the songs of Brahms, yet so thoroughly misses the point of nearly all of them.  He is a purely emotional singer who falls miles short of the artistry of the master.  The Liszt is much better, but of course Liszt was a child compared to Brahms, so naturally the fit between mediocre singer and mediocre composer works on this disc.  However, to his credit, Quasthoff is at least trying to champion the songs of Brahms, but until a singer worthy of this master comes, he will remain (ironically) a lesser appreciated composer of song.
0	This is NOT a piece of music.  It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.  Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1	Great album!
0	Two of the tracks skip. I don't understand why.
1	another poorly made CD-R while there was perfectly fine PRESSED CD available. Stay away from this bs product!
0	Great song, inspiring lyrics, helpful phrases. When you are down or at a low spot in your life this song will help you get through that depression and inspire you with God's spiritual help and gifts.
1	Being a huge fan of Gomez and their music both live and recorded, I was hopeful that this release would help to showcase Ian's talent. Not the case. This is a boring, lackluster album that is seemingly direction-less and comprised of songs that wouldn't be used for B-sides on a regular Gomez single. If you like slow songs that go nowhere with repetative lyrics, then this may be for you. If not, wait for the next Gomez CD.
1	Good beat
0	accidentally bought it
1	Long time John Mayer fan here.  At one point he was favorite musician.  However, this new album is really disappointing.  Only 2 songs are worthwhile in my opinion "Queen of California" and "Something like Olivia".  The rest is just boring to me.  Nothing really jumped out at me and grabbed my attention.  In fact, I find myself having to concentrate hard to keep myself listening and not daydreaming.  It's not just the shift of musical style either.  I like this low key / folky / americana kind of vibe when it's done well.  Ray Lamontagne's "God Willing and the Creek Don't Rise" comes to mind.  LOVED that album and that seems to be type of vibe John Mayer was shooting for in this release.  Unfortunately, I think he missed the mark by a mile.
0	I love this song!
0	I've been listening to The Drop that Contained the Sea since I downloaded it this morning and am loving it! A worthy successor.
0	This is the radio version of this song that I was looking for. This is the version I remember and wanted to buy and that is exactly what I got. This is not a live version, it is a studio recording most commonly heard. I have never had a problem with sound quality when buying from Amazon. I bought this MP3 a while ago but it needed to be reviewed because it is that cool. This is the version by Mary J. Blige (as stated) and is the remake of the Rose Royce version.
0	Some of the best Ella music I've heard. Ella recorded live is awesome! Got this as a gift for my son and we both can't get enough of it.
0	I did not get this download even though they charged me for it.
0	I didn't order this.  Not sure who Avalon is or what it is...I don't remember this order at all. thank you
0	Got for a friend that likes to glog -I sure couldn't keep up - Smiles - Still rhe best rendition - I think
0	I was first introduced to Dan Cummins one very late late he was so funny I woke everyone up in my house. Chinese Affection is hilarious and won't disappoint. To end this review with my favorite saying, here come the spoons mother f'er!
0	This version does not have the tecnical excellence of other versions nor does it evoke the same emotions as other versions.  All in all a bit of a disappointment.
0	Very good.  Not just the AM radio hits.  SOme very cool covers
1	It's a very nice song, I love it
1	The download was of incredibly poor quality, with skips and cuts galore.  Beware.  Get the album, or be prepared to download more than once.

0	Superb album by Killswitch Engage!  The songs are heavy and catchy, with Jesse's bet vocals to date.
1	Lionel Richie is the Best. Clasic Music will shop again.  Best Price for Relaxing enjoyment .I will buy again , happy to have found Amazons Music
1	this was to go on a MP3 player and never got loaded yet I was charged for and never got it and it was for my son
1	Blame it on the recent use in a commercial, but this one is now on my iPod.
0	I generally use these environment CD's for background atmosphere while I'm painting or for playing role playing games with my friends. I took a chance on this one because it was cheap and I'm trying to build up a good collection of environment CD's so I can just let them play without having to change them or mess with itunes. Anyway, this was cheap so I thought I'd give it a go and unlike the purchase I made before it, I don't regret this one at all.  This was a very cool and creepy collection of tracks in a nice 'slow burn' kind of way.  It reminded me of the atmosphere from the 1st Alien movie.  There isn't anything jarring in them and they're pretty relaxing.  Impressive considering that they're still creepy!  Anyway, this is a nice neutral gaming background track that I now use when the situation permits and actually works while I'm painting too.  For the price, you can't beat it.
1	I remember this funky tune from 1967. I thought it was pretty good. I like the refreshing up-beat character of it. It still makes my knees wiggle. The MP3 sound is amazingly good.
1	Catchy beat and profound lyricism! This song is my new addiction.
1	I love all her songs .I think she is one of the great  singers of our time .She did Memory  so beautyfull
1	This song is haunting and makes you realize what to prioritize in your life.
0	I cannot believe how low people's musical tastes have dropped over the past few years. This drivel is given over 100 5 star reviews!?!?!?! Are you serious!?!??! It isn't about how she compares with older R&B/soul divas (she doesn't) or how contrived and boring her lyrics are (Your going to rehab? congrats!!), the fact is that people like this album BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD TO.
1	I absolutely love this cd this woman is definitely blessed by our Lord. I look forward to hearing more of her music she's very talented. I can identify with all the songs on the cd. Sad that there is only six. Keep them coming Lauren :)
1	There is so much that can be said for Ciara in her personal life right now. The end of her relationship with her fiancee Future had ended with him cheating on her, and also her music has not really been anything extraordinary. The latest set of songs she had come out with have been poor, than anything that really comes from the impassioned heart. The setup for her last couple of albums Ciara and Fantasy Ride have been much more lackluster than strong. I really did not find the songs like Body Party and Love, Sex & Magic to be anything impressive. Dance Like We're Making Love, the latest song from her upcoming album Jackie isn't anything that ignites at all. She tries to be seductive, but honestly Ciara instead feels more like a whimper alone. The song feels weak and her tone into the song sincerely is not anything that is special. If Ciara really is going to keep making poor songs, I think it is honestly time for her to considering retiring from a music career. Her next album should have better than this song really did.  Song: D+
0	It's a cute song about couples having issues but still willing to work at it even when their friends and families wonder why.
1	Sweet
1	It's a great song.  Their songs always touch the heart as well as being musically wonderful.  Just when you think they can't get even better, they do.
0	When I bought this album I didn't even know who J.Moss was.  I really took a chance on it and I'm glad I did. I can listen to this CD all day everyday and never get sick of it.  It's just a refreshing CD to take your mind off the troubles of the world.
0	It is a very short little recording about how Laughing Yoga came to being.  Nothing that I didn't already get from the internet.  However, since I choose the MP3 version, I am going to keep it as a reminder to use laugh yoga.  Sometimes I get so caught up  with my life that I forget some of the tools that are in my tool box that will allow me to get through my day, so much easier.  I am defiantly going to explore Laughing Yoga and Laughing therapy more in depth. I think that it is a Great Tool that Everyone should have in their tool box!
1	First let me say that I love the Counting Crows original work.  Their first two albums are absolutely brilliant.  Now let me talk about how I feel about this one.  It just seems like a rambling of words.  In fact, I don't understand why everyone is rating this one so highly.  A lot of the melodies sound very similar.  A lot of the song are way too long at over 5 minutes a piece.  The only song I really seem to like is "Scarecrow."  This rest are just so-so.
0	February 6,2017, Good news product just arrived in the mail I am happy to say. Don't know what the delay was but I am happy to have it at last. Thanks dodax-online!
0	Fantastic vocals, smooth melody, great song
0	Exactly as I had expected.
0	loved the 50's and 60's this is great has a great many of my favorite singers.
0	Love this CD
1	I just a fan of this series and music. Nujabes is a master of mixing Jazz, Hip Hop, and Asian fusion beats to make perfect harmony. I play this on my way home from Corporate America to mellow out. I also received this very fast!
0	Do not purchase this song. After my purchase was complete I was only able to listen to the first 5 seconds of the song before it cuts out.
0	Free download- not my style of music
0	I just wish this album version was the same as it is in the movie.  After watching this movie with my girlfriend I thought I just had to have this song.  Amanda Seyfried's voice is amazing and her rendition of I Have A Dream is just outstanding.  But it's not just her it's also the arrangement in the movie that makes it so beautiful when she sings this in the movie.  Both times as the song starts out there's almost no accompaniment.  It's just her singing.  Sadly on the album version they decided to add music throughout the song.  It's still a lovely song.  It's just not the same.  If you saw this movie and decided you just have to own this song, I still recommend it.  Just know that it's not exactly the same.
1	Ok, for free how can I complain?  It's easy.  This collection sounds like it was put together from rejected tracks.  David Arkenstone (who I mostly like) is on many tracks.  This sounds sub par for him.  He has a plethora of albums. Go find something else if you want to sample him.
1	Great tune from Satch!  This is how music is supposed to be in the real world.....not this autotuned computerized crap they try to pass off as music these days.
1	this is a very inspirational song. sometimes we want to give up without realizing that GOD is always there to help us out
0	A plodding account, orchestra barely adequate, 1 soloist hard on the ears, balance off, a day service to wonderful music.  Look elsewhere
1	One of my favorite childhood albums.  I WANT this music back!!!!  Please release on CD!!
1	It a good song it makes me laugh couse I have friends that do what the song says all the time lol ;-)
1	I recently happened to learn about the Dutch violinist Emmy Verhey. Her performances of the Tchaikovsky and Mendelssohn violin concertos were included in a budget download I picked up here on Amazon (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-History-of-Violin-100-Famous-Songs/dp/B00TC2AC00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The History of Violin (100 Famous Songs)</a>, and they are excellent. It led me to look further into her repertoire to see what else I could find, and other classical fans familiar with her also had some recommendations, specifically&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/her-performances-of-the-Beethoven-violin-sonatas-with-the-Dutch-pianist-Carlos-Moerdijk/dp/B003K2KLMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">her performances of the Beethoven violin sonatas with the Dutch pianist Carlos Moerdijk</a>&nbsp;which I also acquired and am now enjoying. Also recommended were her recordings of Bach's violin concertos, which is what led me to this collection of Bach performances.  Some additional background concerning Emmy Verhey, a violinist who I think deserves greater recognition here. In 1966, at the age of 17, she was the youngest prize winning finalist at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. The wiki article on her reports that a week later, when she graduated from the Amsterdam Conservatory, "the public interest for her examination was so huge that it had to take place in the Great Hall (Grote Zaal) of the Concertgebouw." To this day she remains the youngest ever prize winner at the Tchaikovsky competition. She went on to teach violin at Utrecht's Conservatory, from 1983 to 2002, and has performed and recorded worldwide. For much of her career she performed using the 1723 `Earl Spencer' Stradivarius that is now on loan to Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti. Just last year she announced her retirement effective at the end of the 2014/2015 concert season.  Now, her performances are available on a variety of recordings and collections, but they are not always easy to find. Many are buried within budget compilations such as the "History of Violin" collection I mentioned above. Others are included in various box sets from Brilliant Classics. Searching through those various listings, here on Amazon and elsewhere, I finally identified this Bach collection and purchased it (I obtained my copy from iTunes). I've been listening to it and particularly enjoy the Bach violin concerto performances very much.  However, this collection also includes some performances that I'm unable to fully vet, in the sense that the artists identified here (or on iTunes, which has a slightly different identification for some of the tracks), are either so obscure that they've left essentially no trace on the internet (unlikely) or they are pseudonyms or fake names for performers, something that can be found with certain budget classical music releases. I'll explain further below, where I go through this release track by track.  So - what are my conclusions regarding this "Complete Violin Concertos" release? I have mixed feelings about it, but overall I think it's very good. It is absolutely worth purchasing simply to get the Emmy Verhey performances. The others may not be to the same standard but are still satisfactory. At first I was going to give this recording a lower rating but finally decided to give it 5 stars, because the Verhey performances are so excellent, and the price of this collection of concertos is so reasonable. The mixed quality of the other performances and the unsatisfactory information regarding the performers for some of the pieces may matter less to others than it does to me, so I don't want to have that reflect badly on the overall recording.  Contents in detail:  Tracks 1-3: Bach: Concerto No. 1 in A Minor for Violin and Strings, BWV 1041 -- Emmy Verhey, violin; Alun Francis leading the Camerata Antonio Lucio Tracks 4-6: Bach: Concerto No. 2 in E Major for Violin and Strings, BWV 1042 -- Emmy Verhey, violin; Alun Francis leading the Camerata Antonio Lucio  - these are superb performances, warm sound, and excellent ensemble playing from Camerata Antonio Lucio, the string ensemble co-founded by Verhey in 1991. Performance dates and venue not known  Tracks 7-9: Bach: Concerto in D Minor for 2 Violins, Strings and B.C, BWV 1043 -- Camerata Romana, Joseph Brezina, Feliz Elias & Eugen Duvier Tracks 10-12: Bach: Concerto in C Minor for Oboe, Violin and Orchestra, BWV 1060 -- Camerata Romana, Rachel Applebaum, Tracy Zobel & Eugen Duvier  - performance quality satisfactory - The artists identified are probably pseudonyms - the ensemble name Camerata Romana (as iTunes identifies it; here on Amazon it is identified as Camerata Rhenania), and the artist name Eugen Duvier are both identified elsewhere on the internet as fake names. I'm unable to find any information on any of these performers anywhere on the internet, leading me to believe that they are most likely all fake names.  Tracks 13-15: Bach: Concerto in G Minor for Violin and Strings, BWV 1056R (After Harpsichord Concerto No. 5 in F Minor) -- Emmy Verhey, violin; Alun Francis leading the Camerata Antonio Lucio Tracks 16-18: Bach: Concerto in D Minor for Violin and Strings, BWV 1052R (After Harpsichord Concerto No. 1 in D Minor) -- Emmy Verhey, violin; Alun Francis leading the Camerata Antonio Lucio  - As with the earlier violin concertos, these are really excellent performances  Tracks 19-21: Bach: Concerto in A Minor for Flute, Violin, Harpsichord and Orchestra, BWV 1044 -- Christiane Jaccottet, harpsichord; Georg Egger, violin; Gnther Hller, flute; Jrg Faerber directing the Wrttemberg Chamber Orchestra Heilbronn  - Very nice performance of this concerto. The Wrttemberg Chamber Orchestra Heilbronn is a very well-known german ensemble, and the artists listed are prominent performers. Performance dates and venue not known.  Altogether 1 hr and 58 minutes of music, equivalent to two discs if it had been released on CD.
1	Awesome! The only downside is it's addictive. Buyer beware, you just can't get enough!!!
0	Nirvana is known by most as a revolutionary band which changed the music scene single handedly with their monster major-label debut "Nevermind" on David Geffen. I had just finished my Mormon mission when these guys came out, and I can remember nothing but madness coming from Cobain's mouth.  With dire interest into Cobain's life, I picked up a book about him. I was shocked and horrified at what he thought his life was like. He was a political aristocrat? A feminist? A God-hating fool with no direction? Stunned at what I had read, I felt compelled to write something about these guys.  Feminism and related God-hating practices are not the way to go about life. Family Values and Righteous Church-going is what keeps today's society alive, not crazy Liberal messages of hate and disgust. On top of all this, he committed suicide on April 5 of 1994, as most Nirvana fans recall. This is how to go to hell the quickest, commit suicide.  To help prevent this, I suggest you attend the church of latter-day saints to help you get a grip on life and find out more about God and his plans for you.  P.S. In no way am I affiliated with "Prophet Gordon". I assume this man is a fake and trying to give the Mormon church a bad name. I wrote this review in hopes that you will change your mind about Mormons and that we are not a bunch of abusive weirdos.
1	Q: What do you think are Passenger's greatest achievements up to now? A: Surpassing the Chi-Lites as the mopiest, droopiest band in history, and having even more annoying diction than REO Speedwagon.  Q: But is *Let Her Go* a good song? A: It is a well-written song. It's the performance that's the problem.  Q: How so? A: The singer is way too emotional. It's a simple song and would pack more punch if performed in a simple, plain manner. But this guy's hammier than an Easter Dinner.  Q: Where is the singer from? A: Britain.  Q: Then why does he sing with a Vietnamese accent? A: Not certain at this time. Probably one of his handlers read somewhere that Vietnamese accents are especially attractive to lovelorn teenage girls.  Q: So if you don't like the performance, who do you think could do it better? A: I'd like to see it either reworked as a country tune by a man with a male voice--Trace Adkins, let's say--or as a pop song by a woman who knows how to use her voice. Lorde comes to mind there.  Q: Given the chance, would you punch the singer in the face? A: Not at this time. But all bets are off if he does a remake of *Oh Girl* or *Keep on Loving You*.
1	This had to be the worst recording of the Beethoven Concerto that I have ever heard. I didn't know who the soloist was at first. I thought whoever he was struggled and totally failed to communicate the greatness of this Beethoven work. Perhaps not all his fault, but I wonder if this great artist, my favorite, other than Perlman, actually listened to the original recording which was later remastered? The orchestra was terrible, the strings not even together, and terribly loud at the wrong times. The violin Menuhin used was a total loss, lacking clarity, power, colors, contrasts and emotional expression. The  upper E string was barely audible, and I couldn't really hear any notes from the violin clearly. Menuhin purchased the Soil Strad in 1950 and Perlman since 1986. I sonder what happened to all the good string players in the Berlin Phild during WW II? Who was the maker and year of the violin he used? Who did Menuhin rely on for adjustment of the violin he used? Charles Harman
0	This is not a punk album.  This is a straight mainstream rock record that has the packaging of a punk band.  Any true punk listener should stay far away. If however you like "punk" like blink 182 or american hifi or any of those other stupid bands, this cd would fit real good next to your linkin park and blink 182 cds.  People who like real punk should not even look at this cd!
1	loved the first album and here unique sound.  this is way too standard pop.  that said, I am probably not her target audience.
1	One brief listen and I was hooked. Stumbled onto a You Tube video and couldn't believe my ears. Purchased her 2 albums and both are good...excellent...but this one is the best. She's written her music and she just shines. Brilliantly.
1	If you're looking for European dance noise with a cool beat that doesn't demand your attention while you're skanking, this is it.  If you're looking for something so monotonous your parents will give you money and car privileges for turning it off, this is it.  Each song is a dance beat, sometimes sound effects, and on rare occasions a discernable 4 or 5 bars of repetitive melody.  If you know what you want, and this is it, get it.
0	Love this song, it brings tears to my eyes every time.
1	I bought this album after seeing the news story about them playing for the woman who was injured in the SXSW drunk driver accident. The buy was more one of principal, but I actually really like the music. I'm a big Avett Brothers fan, and these guys seem to have a similar (if slightly mellowed) vibe. Good stuff and I highly recommend them and their music!
0	This is a great song to work out to. Upbeat with a fast tempo, I find myself picking up the pace and the lyrics are great. Very fun!
1	Whatever you do always do it for the lord if is for you or for someone is an amazing cd.
0	I wish I could give this CD 0 Stars. This CD was Very poorly done the sound quality is less than amateur. I must say to the guys at Atomic Audio that put this CD out "Don't quit your day jobs".  This CD truly epitomizes the term Boot Leg.  I have now purchased "The Original Experience Vol. 1" by the Original Lee Roy Mercer on the JOCULAR Record label, and I called up Atomic Audio once after buying their CD and asked them what the deal was with their "The Real Leroy Mercer is John Bean" CD. The answer I was given was a lot funnier than their CD. They went in to this big story saying " This guy named John Bean made these calls and he is dead now he died 20 years ago and his sister told us we could sell his CD". I asked them why the sound was so poor on their CD and that it was obvious to me that the JOCULAR Record label that put out The Original Experience Vol. 1  had superior sound quality and that their CD did not have a stick on label on the disk like the Atomic Audio CD did. They said "We got the original sound recording from a cassette tape from John's sister and made our own CDs at home, did you not think our CD booklets look nice?".  I said " No, you got your recordings from someone that made copies from at least a 100th generation Boot Leg cassette and they thought you would be dumb enough to buy it from them and then try to market it ".  Did these guys just wake up one morning and say to them selves "I Think We Will Be A Record Label Today"?  this is a Amateur Record Label Selling a Bootleg CD, Don't buy it!!!  If You Want The Best By The Best, Buy "The Original Experience Vol. 1" by Lee Roy Mercer on JOCULAR Records it is the real deal.  A True Lee Roy Mercer Fan ....
1	All I can say is thank God for giving young mesn and women beautiful voices and the want to serve Him.
1	This is a nice Classic song. Use to hear it when my father used to listen to the radio back in the day. Great words, nice melody; nice song.
1	Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, Chicago adds to their already great lineup of timeless classic Christmas tunes a few more tracks that make this CD a "must-have" even if one has their Christmas CD from four years ago.  This CD is much like their music I grew up with in the 70's and I am glad to see they still have it after all these years.  The power of the awesome horn section combined with the great mixture of percussion, ivories, strings and vocals in the Christmas tradition brings back much of their imaginative spirit we have come to expect from the band.  I have followed this group since 1970, having bought most of their recordings, I would rate this up there as one of their best.  There are plenty interpretations of the Christmas classics but this band just added another flair just not heard out there.  I even got another generation hooked on Chicago thanks to this CD.  Now my teenage son is begging me for their older stuff.  My favorite track is "Jolly Old St. Nicholas" with Keith Howland's guitar licks and his vocals adds another dimension to an already vocal-rich lineup of Robert Lamm, Jason Scheff and Bill Champlin.  Even Lee Loughnane gets into the singing act on another awesome tune of "Let It Snow" from their original Christmas release.  There will always be folks out there that don't like Chicago's music no matter what they do, for those of us that do, thanks guys for another dimension to your brilliant career.
1	The file is corrupt, was able to download bit would not play.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1	Audiomachine features music often used as movie trailer music or background music.  I use it in my classroom as background music during different activities.
0	One of my favorite songs
1	its the truth
0	Loudness war much?  This thing is crazy loud! You don't need to compress the audio so much to make it sound loud -- just turn the volume up!
1	I particularly enjoy the Handel's Messiah.  The choir that I sing with did this particular piece (not as well as the CD of course).  I think we will do it again Christmas time.  Other songs we good also.  But my favorite if the Handel's Messiah.
1	I shazammed a song by Paul hardcastle called the sound of summer and mistakenly purchased the sound of summer rain.  Not what I wanted and to make matters worse the song I wantef wasn't on the mp3.
1	This song is hard to describe. Everyone on the planet knows it by now and saying anything further just seems silly.  It's an amazing bit of music and I simply love it. That is all.
0	I love this album and could listen to Adele sing all  night and all day.  Worth purchasing as it will be one I listen to again and again.
0	If this were a just world, this song and its LP, Crayons, would do for Donna Summer what Believe did for Cher.  Regardless, download this one.  Blast it in your car.  Especially if you are feeling a little like life is bringing you down.  Her vocals are flawless and she looks stunning (the video is out).  Modern but without losing any pop/dance sensibilities Summer is master of.
0	Bought the clean version of the song because prime music would not play the clean version, was a little annoyed, but love the song either way. This remixed version is actually pretty good and I'm ok with is being the only version I listen to. The unedited is perfectly fine, but I try not to have bad language in music that gets played around my toddler. So I'm glad that they had a clean version.
0	Love George Jones, this is one of many of my favorite songs.  This song brings back good memories.  He will be missed.
1	after Lance Armstrong dumped her... no heartfelt emotion. It sounds like she's singing a grocery list.  Compare this with the Cat Stevens' version.
1	Wonderful show that is not on cable and the songs are even better!!
1	I bought this for my easy listening playlist. His voice is very soothing. I would recommend this to anyone looking to add to their easy listening playlist.
0	Now that his screeching, over-modulating, endlessly trying-to-find-the melody 24-year rampage is over I might start listening to Chicago again. He's got a voice only a mother could love.
1	Not the version I wanted.
1	So if you're a Buckethead fan you already know about this song and have listened to it way too much. But if you're like me you'll still love it each and every time. Definitly one of Buckets gems and belongs near the top of any guitar shred all time best lists. Too bad the guy doesn't get more credit, but I think he likes it that way and hey, maybe I do too!
0	I did not like this version of this song, but since this was free, I guess I  should not complain.
0	This is not Renato Carosone.  There has been a technical difficulty for months which Amazon.com has not yet corrected.  I would love to have a download of "l'hai voluto te" but instead I am getting the "All Time Hits" of Dr. Rajkumar, whoever he is.
1	Not your average group. Not your average songs. These make you want to groove. Just like their previous releases. Not for everyone tho. But since you are even looking at this review, then there's hope for you not being average and you like chair dancing / grooving while at work. So, buy this release, and encourage Fitz and the Tantrums to make more chair dancing, singing in the car, and grooving in the kitchen while cooking music for us all.
1	Rock...
0	With guidance from Tim Armstrong (Rancid), Jimmy Cliff delivers one of his best records. The cover songs are solid, but it's the originals that allow Jimmy to be Jimmy and really shine. These songs will hold up over time, just like The Harder They Come. Great to see a musician putting out some of his best work in his sixties. Highly recommend.
1	not as good as his other cd
0	This could have been called "Essence, Vol. 2" because it's very much in the vein of that dreadful 2001 release.  Most of the songs are utterly boring. The disc doesn't start moving until song 7. The first six songs should have been rejected.  Her vocals have some irritating "baby-ish" qualities at times.  For you people who call this Lucinda's best work, you've got to be kidding!
0	What a letdown after the superb Wagner Reloaded. This album is so beneath Apocalyptica. What were they thinking? Frankie is a decent singer but a terrible fit for Apocalyptica. He would fit great with any average American radio rock band, but Apocalyptica is not an average American radio rock band. All of the vocal songs are just average and generic. I haven't heard a single original vocal melody on the whole record. If someone had played this to me without saying which band this was I would have never bought this CD. I did hear "Cold Blood" prior to ordering the album, but after that I heard "Till Death Do Us Part" which gave me hope that "Cold Blood" was an exception, but unfortunately that was not the case. "Till Death .." is pretty much the only outstanding track on the whole album. I can only hope that this is a one shot thing and that they will go back to being an original Scandinavian band. We already have too many average, generic American radio rock bands.
1	Incredible piece of work always been a fan of J.Cole. He's been consistent and knows exactly what he is doing and where he is going with his career. Just two things to say to J. Sing less on your albums and try to invite one or two artists in at least. Kendrick has his place in one the track I can't recall the title maybe Drake too or ASAP....
0	great cd but package arrived damaged.........again
0	I am just a casual hip hop fan, but have enjoyed Eminem a lot since the Slip Shady LP. There are definitely some good songs, but I was not blown away... I forgot I even had it until I saw this too. Personally though, I think the Eminem Show was his last really good album (possible Encore), so if you have enjoyed more recent stuff this might be great.
1	Like his style on show,  new stuff is just ok.  A few good songs.  He is a great singer, though.
1	This song is a blatanly obvious Janet Jackson Rhythmn Nation era ripoff song. Dated late eighties early nineties production hasn't dated too well. This is from an era when the cassette singles were the rage and Civilles and Cole were at da top of their game and peeps wuz cuttin their hair in a high top fade like will smith and arsenio.
0	I enjoyed this music and the lyrics.  Crown of thorns drew me to this talented singer.
1	Close your eyes... follow the water....
1	This is a great collection of early jazz recordings. There's 28 songs on the cd. Good sound quality and a great value for the price! I recommend this cd for anyone interested in early jazz.
0	Great Album, it came faster than i expected.
0	Let me first state that the disc is NOT the Rhino Handmade version with the 23 tracks listed above, but is, instead, the Rhino Encore European re-release of just the original 11-track album.  While the absence of the 12 bonus tracks from the Handmade version is a tremendous loss, what remains is still an outstanding album.  "3614 Jackson Highway" is perhaps the album that most clearly shows the extent of Cher's true talent as a pop singer with an R&B tinge to her voice and interpretations.  Comparisons with Dusty Springfield are spot-on.  Each of the songs is sung in a straight-forward, appropriately instrumented and produced manner.  It is interesting to imagine how Cher's career would have turned out if she had stayed on the trajectory established by this album, rather than going into the kitschy story songs, the campy sketch comedy of the her (and her and Sonny's) tv variety shows, the disco phase and her ultimate near-beatification as a gay icon.  Instead, she would likely have been a highly respected singer, though not a tremendously popular one.  In any event, 3614 Jackson Highway is a necessity for any fan of Cher's or of soulful 60's pop/rock.  (Now if we could only get Rhino to release her other (albeit entirely different) neglected masterpiece, "Stars.")
1	Some great songs, but very short album. Great music, but should be priced lower based on very short length of album.
1	Honestly, this album is no where near as good as the new one they put out last year "As it is on earth" - that album is a solid 4-5 stars!  This has one "hit" from the 90s but is no where near as creative as "as it is on earth"
1	This bands first EP is great! Each song is well worth the price! I cant wait to hear what this up and coming band has in store!!
0	Great song Family enjoyed listening to it
1	I enjoyed this album. It is a change from traditional "traditional", but not contemporary.  Worth a download! At least go through the samples and give it a listen!
1	Merle Haggard & Willie Nelson "Django And Jimmie" (Sony Legacy, 2015) . . . . .  Willie and Merle have recorded together before, but this album has a special resonance -- it's a lot of fun to listen to, and holds up really well. These two old-timers are having a great time here, with each of them are at their geezerly best, singing robust, humor-filled songs -- some oldies, some new stuff, and a sweet mix of novelty songs and heart-rending weepers.  "It's All Going To Pot" is the standout track -- a stoner-delic double entendre gem which basically says, sure the world's going to hell in a handbasket, but my buddy Willie sure can score some great weed.  They wax nostalgic about music and musicians, including a raunchy song about Johnny Cash where they tell old war stories about Cash's crazy years, and they pay homage to gypsy jazz legend Django Reinhardt and blue yodeler Jimmie Rodgers in the album's title track. Another album highlight is "Live This Long," where they marvel at their own longevity (considering all the damage they've done over the years) while on the more serious side the ballad "Somewhere Between" is a devastating dissection of a man's painful self-awareness of a love gone wrong.  They add strong covers of Dylan's "Don't Think Twice" and the gospel classic, "Family Bible," along with various outlaw tunes.  Buddy Cannon's production adds a hearty, round-toned feel and, as on other recent albums, he again proves himself a perfect collaborator with Willie Nelson, giving his music a clarity and simplicity that makes each song a highly listenable gem.  You won't be disappointed by this album: it's every bit as good as you'd hoped it would be. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)
1	Crossfade's "Falling Away" is an alright album. Not as good as their debut album though, but it a good effort. I am still a fan of Crossfade, but I think the band was better with Tony. No offence but I really don't like Mitch's vocals. It sounds like he is trying to hard, but with Tony the first album had a great flow to it and was really powerful and really great lyrics. I listened to all the songs through the 1st verse to the chorus and I hate to say most of the songs I was pretty disapointed with. The lyrics aren't all that great and the music is not really at beat with the lyrics. There is only about 2 songs that are good, including "Invincible", and the other is Anchor, which the orginial is still better. I am not bad mouthing this album, but I know Crossfade could of done a lot better.
1	it was free
0	Terrible song! I just needed the clean version for Djing. This is the reason Hip Hop is dead amongst most Black artists!
1	What can I say. I love the hair bands. And Warrant kicks ass in this album. One I really never knew about until I saw it on Youtube.
0	Great song ruined by the out of place solo rap fragment buy the original version
1	The song Precious is just a little bit odd. Not necessarily Lifehouse material. Wouldn't recommend, unless you love all their songs
1	I think this is by far the greatest Praise and Worship songs of all times. Thanks to Mr. Fred Hammond & RFC for this wonderful song
1	I can not stand this song it honestly has a bad beat and it really is not encouraging, but i guess you have to hear it to find out! P. S. Lady gagas applause is a whole lot better!
1	one of those ole songs
1	This is a relaxing collection of Ohta Jr.'s ukulele music.  I would give it 5-stars if songs were played with solely an ukulele (or two as his CDs with Daniel Ho offered), but a guitar and string instruments lending support to Ohta Jr.'s fabulous renditions of a beautiful collection of songs detracts from enjoying his pure, beautiful ukulele style.  The individual songs are very nice songs. Despite my stated bias, I'm sure many will find this CD a joy to listen to as soothing background music.
1	They have some nerve calling this party music. Super lame. I wish I had previewed it before I bought it. I wouldn't have if I did.
1	Great addition to my classic collection.
0	I had hoped it would simply be a transfer of the original to this cd. Unfortunately I was wrong. Why it was altered to its current state is beyond me. The original had more depth and power and dynamic drive throughout, which this barren shell of an offering is sorely lacking. I will have to try and see if I can order the original in order to get what I pay for. For what it's worth.
1	I just bought this from another site which DID not have reviews: if I had just researched on amazon I would have seen that this  is NOT THE ORIGINAL Soundtrack. It is a sterile re recording of the melodies with very bad female vocals. DO NOT BUY

0	Red hot!
1	One of their best
1	The true "Cyclone (Candles in the Rain)" is one of the greatest songs musically ever produced, a wall of screaming emotion that seamlessly, magically blends two songs together and makes it WORK.  It is also over 7 minutes long.  This one isn't it.  It is only the "Cyclone" song.  It's 4 minutes long.  Some clerk who didn't know what the titles were referring to copied it over by mistake.  Arrrrrrgh.  NOT what I was looking for.  ...Melanie gets six stars out of five even in her throwaway songs, she's like the Picasso of acoustic guitar, brilliant without effort.  Astounding creativity.  Rating is for misclassification; Cyclone gets 5 stars by itself, but does not make song-of-the-decade.  FYI.
0	This is one of those "let's all get up and dance, because he's telling us what to do" type songs like The Electric Slide or Cotton-Eyed Joe. It's annoying and stupid but everyone wants to get up and dance to it. It's a gateway song. So I have to appreciate it for that, but otherwise it's absolutely terrible.
1	Not the quality of production we're accustomed to from Josh.  There is nothing even close to memorable in this compilation and the vocals are way too out front relative to the orchestration.  The voice sounds forced and uneven.  I will remain hopeful that Josh's next offerings will be higher quality.
1	I only found 10 songs that are worth listening to on this CD and as a Dream Theater fan I find that disappointing. Anyhow, there is nothing for me to add that has not already been said by other's - other than here is my two cents worth on the few songs worth listening to on this CD. Ten tracks coming in at a whopping 50 mins.  03 The Gift Of Music 13 A Life Left Behind 15 Chosen 16 A Tempting Offer 19 A New Beginning 22 Moment Of Betrayal 23 Heaven's Cove 25 The Path That Divides 28 My Last Farewell 32 Our New World
0	Very good album with some new kind of songs from switchfoot
1	One of her best albums - simply love it.
1	I bought it to use as a ring tone. That is one way to make you actually hate a song. This one seems to just drag on. After about 45 seconds you want to kill yourself.
0	Shame on Amazon for not disclosing that this CD requires dangerous malware to play!  I won't be able to play in on my computer or load it on my iPod.  You got my money this time, but I'll never purchase another product by this artist or by Sony.
0	fine product
1	Hate it ordered in error. Can't delete order
1	I only liked one song and believe me I listened to the CD at least 5 times to make sure it was only the one song.  I still listen to their first CD over and over and over...No comparison. Cold is still one of my all time favorite songs.  I agree with many: What happened?
1	Just a terrible high-pitched (hisss) sound to this greatest hits collection.  I downloaded it and immediately deleted it.  I recommend buying the album, "6 Picks: Essential Radio Hits EP", which has Sixpence's Greatest hits, without alteration, and then downloading the remaining songs from their corresponding albums.
1	Enjoy this
0	Love this song.  It was so easy to download and copy to my CD.  Would definitely purchase more in the future.  Thank you.  A ++
0	not religious but this is one I need on my playlist!
1	Great music cd.  One of my favorite artist.  Doesn't have two songs that I would have liked but great cd otherwise.
1	What can you say about an audio recording?  Love the song, love the download!  Love this whole era's music.  Buy it.
1	Good
1	With free listens available now on iTunes, I haven't squandered money on a Broadway album since Spring Awakening, which was worth the eleven or twelve bucks or so, because I listened to it many times, because it was a terrific score, well worth listening to many times. But when I read Brantley's review, and Teachout's, I thought, What the hell, this has to be worth it, and I plucked down (or uploaded?) my hard-earned cash. So, let's say that neither Brantley nor Teachout are on the take, and that neither are suffering incipient dementia. Instead, let's say that their reviews are a sort of professional hazard: a break with sanity after years of being forced to listen to just-okay scores. After that sort of suffering (which must violate some Geneva convention taboo or other), insipid just-okay-ness like this score must seem like the second coming of Leonard Bernstein. Actually, what I really believe may be happening is that they're hearing the score as they're watching the show, and the actors, and scenery and glitz, etc., are making the score seem much better than it would if it was inflicted on them as it was on me, straight from the album. So what's wrong with it? The lyrics are serviceable, but just serviceable. The music hasn't got a single original note, it sounds exactly like late-career Cy Coleman, or like a Mel Brooks parody of a Broadway musical--except for the lyric-less tune that begins with some banjo-like instrument until the piano takes over, and even that has it's limits of enjoyment, because it wants to swing, but either the band hasn't got the chops, or the conductor won't let them swing it out of the quadrangle. The tunes are unmemorable, and almost every song drifts from the tune into slack, poorly constructed maundering, until it works its way back to the tune-that-isn't-quite-a-tune. A very mediocre experience overall. My hard-earned and much needed money, wasted.
1	Great song!
1	Not me
1	Is this a Crusaders cd or a Richard Beirach cd? Be careful, folks, your don't really know what you'll be getting when you order this. If it is the Richard Beirach cd, I would give it five stars. It is my favorite piano trio cd. Can't say I ever heard the Crusaders cd, but I like the cover.
1	I bought this song on Amazon, and Rumor has it that its been topping the charts forever now! Highly recommend the powerful voice of Adele and all the other songs on 21.
1	I purchased the song from Amazon without paying close attention - bummer for me.  It was a MP3 track not ITunes format.  Not sure where my mind was.  I had to purchase again from ITunes.  Pay attention to format.
1	If you are reading reviews on amazon.com to help you decide whether or not to buy this particular album, take my advice: do it.  You will be happy with your purchase.  Javier has a beautiful voice; it is clear and pure.  He does great runs, but he does not over-run, as is the tendency with some current r&b/soul singers.  One thing I really appreciate with singers is when they are actually part of the production of their albums.  Javier is actually a musician, not just a singer.  He writes and plays instruments.  This album is fabulous.  Do yourself a favor and pick it up.
0	LOVE it it gets you going
1	The Recording was scratchy and faded; very poor quality  I will not buy old songs from Amazon when trying to fill in my mp3 library.
1	This is one of my favorite Christmas songs. She kinda butchers it. That isn't to say it's horrible if she were your cousin singing it in front of your fireplace. But as a professional who seems to be able to hold a tune, she's just not good.
1	Ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information.  Was not like the picture.  Returned 1st one and ordered a second which was identical to the first.  Also was returned.
0	I went into this album thinking it was going to totally suck without Tom. I was so wrong. I have listened to this album on repeat since it came out. No Future and Cynical have been stuck in my head, even in my dreams. This is definitely my album of the year, and is definitely up there with Take Off and Enema Of The State for me.
1	Some fun songs on this one
1	Not even close to sounding like the original edited track.  In fact, it is the same ill fated band trying to make a buck at JUNK!! If I could have heard even two seconds of this I would have realized that and not have made the purchase! Enjoy your 99 cents you P.O.S.
1	Insipid versions of holiday classics that never deserved to be released.  Dylan's voice, an acquired taste even in its' finest moments, sounds as if he's been gargling with old razor blades.  Throughout my first (and only) listen to this mess-terpiece, I couldn't help but think that even Wild Man Fischer would have had more self-respect than to issue such drek.  Absolutely dreadful and should be avoided at all costs.
1	This is one of the greatest female vocalists of any era and the proof is in the music. This album and all her music really hit me over the past year and I can't even do it justice with my words so here is a lyric that I like in an album full of love stories...  This face in my dreams seizes my guts He floods me with dread Soaked in soul He swims in my eyes by the bed Pour myself over him Moon spilling in And I wake up alone
1	Love it!
0	I bought the vinyl version of this album, hoping that it would sound smoother than the standard progressive rock CD, but I was not impressed. I couldn't even get to the second LP, as my ears were already fatigued after hearing so much jitter on the first LP.  The crash cymbal swamped the entire left side of the image. When a cymbal sounds like it's 6 feet wide, this is due to jitter.  Jitter is much more of an issue when recording/playing using digital equipment. We're using a turntable to play it, so that part's analog. Since there's so much jitter on this vinyl, I have to think that they mixed the recording directly to digital first, and then converted and pressed it to analog vinyl. Doing this defeats the purpose of listening to music using an analog source.  If you want a comparison, listen to some 70s Supertramp on vinyl (recommend breakfast in america) or Pink Floyd (recommend the wall), and then compare the sound to this Coheed and Cambria LP. Don't fault the artist. Coheed and Cambria is an absolutely fantastic band. But do fault the recording studio.  I want to hear all of the wonderful harmonies in this album, but I can't when the sound is swamped by recording jitter. Oh well, I'll just have to see them live!
1	This album was awesome and I'm glad I got it on a daily deal. Six more words required. Now two.
1	Love this song. I remember when I first heard it - many years ago.  Still the same feeling - Rock On!!
0	My daughter lives for Hamilton - listens to it everyday!
0	great
0	Uplifting album
1	Zeller's voice is too high for my taste. You may enjoy him, though. And it is the rebbe-ha-dor's niggun, after all.
0	Traci did that!!!
1	it took me a long time to finally see how great this cd is. while i liked sum 41 for a long time, this cd was always dull in comparison to does this look infected. which was a very dark, angry cd. and this was more or less the opposite. this cd was very fun and fast and upbeat. i must admit, their choices of singles could have been better. i feel like their songs like Summer, Rhythms, Handle This, and Heart Attack were miles ahead of fat lip and motivation. this is a classic pop punk cd and when i heard the band had planned their newest work to sound more like this, i was excited at the time. but of course it fell flat and didn't even come close and thats because this cd is nearly untouchable in the realm of pop punk.
0	Didn,t care for this particular cd.
0	I can get 1975-79 for the same price. Not sure why this is priced this way.
1	Eminem done it again. The delivery is nice the beats raw as ever. Overall good production i recommend this one pick it up. If you haven't already. Nothing but the truth. .
0	This album is a perfect example of a band who takes its musical cues from existing artists, jumbles them up and tries to present itself as fresh and new and, heaven forbid, ORIGINAL.  Young the Giant doesn't have an original bone in their bodies (no pun intended).  Do you really know why the song "Cough Syrup" is so catchy and ear-wormy?  It's because its first verse shares the exact same melody as the verse to Scottish new-wavers Altered States' "I Could Be Happy" from (gasp) 1982!!!  If you don't believe me, check it out by listening to the sample before buying.  In fact, most of the song "Cough Syrup" is a mashup of "Happy" crossed with about 90% of the Cocteau Twins entire oeuvre.  I'm still waiting for YTG to perform it on some music awards show and bring out "Super-Special guest" Liz Fraser after the first verse and chorus.  Then Ms. Fraser would warble the second verse in her inimitable, almost incomprehensible, style and the audience would go nuts.  But that would never happen in a million because that would show YTG to be the sham they are.  And that second airplay hit, "My Body" sounds like a cross between the Smiths (or at least Morrissey's solo stuff) and the band James ("Laid"/"Sit Down").  If you like those two song, download them singularly.  Don't waste $$ on the whole album, it's all too derivative and done before.
1	The MP3 track you have associated with this is NOT "Babylon Fall With John Paul."  Please correct.  I note that Rhapsody also has it wrong.
1	It's good to see how Rita Springer has become much more well known in the last few years.  She is a passionate, sold-out worshipper who really knows how to attract the presence of God wherever she goes.  I was impressed with this song when I first heard it several years ago, and it is still fresh, declaring the songwriter's adoring love, devotion and trust in her savior, even when surrounded by darkness and confusion.
0	Great song. I miss my quarterback, he was taken too soon. In tragedy we find strength. God bless you all.
1	The vinyl skipped on multiple tracks, too bad because the cover is sick and the music is great! Returned it, received a replacement and it skipped in the same exact spots.
0	Timeless classic
0	This release of songs by Mr. MacFarlane has to be THE biggest music surprise of 2011 - who would have EVER suspected the voice behind Peter, Stewie, and Brian would have such an incredible vocal range????!!!  Listen to the samples of the CD offered by amazon.com, then decide for yourself.  If you purchase the CD, be sure to read the liner notes - not only can Mr. MacFarlane sing, but is quite articulate as well.  Should he ever decide to put his cartooning days behind him, he would do perfectly fine with a singing career, competing with the likes of Harry Connick, Jr. and Michael Buble.  I would only have two questions for him at this point:  When are you going to do a Christmas CD?; and Will you ever do a concert tour?
0	Such a great soundtrack. A lot better than the first Captain America!! My favorite track is The Winter Soldier. Captures Bucky's situation perfectly by the way it sounds unstable and manic!
0	No words can describe the horrific sounds of this "music." I am quite certain deaf people would be capable of recording better sounds. I've known dogs that can sing along with "music" far better. I can see this making a good torture device. Want to annoy your roommates? Crank this up and they'll be hemorrhaging from their ears in no time at all. You may also have success with it as a gag gift.
0	Excellent Album! Love it!
1	Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.  I would never in a million years be able to identify this as classic Mumford & Sons - other than the fact that the lyrics are better than most bands have.  I own a few CDs that I would be absolutely heartbroken if I lost or broke, this is not going to be one of them.  It's the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but I wouldn't play it driving at night because - dare I say - it is kind of boring and yawn inducing.  I am not going to purchase new - I will wait for used and cheaper.  Not that I think Amazon is asking too much - I just don't think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollars.  Sorry Mumford & Sons, the album is OK but not what we really liked you for.
0	Ordered this expecting original recording of a particular song; it was a REMAKE, not the original,...very disappointing
1	Not the version I wanted.
0	Stating that this is a Remastered recording is very misleading.  The songs sound like they have been burned from a vinyl record.  I was expecting the quality we heard on Anthology 1 (listen to "Three Cool Cats" from Anthology 1 and compare it to the one on this CD.  Enough said).  While it is nice to have the complete collection of songs from the Decca sessions on one CD, Apple/Capitol needs to do the Remastering, similar to the few tracks that made it to the Anthology CD's.  This effort by Recall Records is mediocre at best.  But until there is an official Apple release, this CD is about the best there is available today.  I still enjoyed listening to it very much.
0	I was a bit disappointed in the product as it looks like this came from a library and not in very good condition.
0	great song, easy to access
1	I could not believe that I actually found this album.  It is a treasure of the Los Angeles Jazz scene in the late 60's.  There was Little Esther Phillips, O C Smith and Freddie Jetts Pied Piper Lounge on Crenshaw Boulevard.  Fantastic music, great artist.  Sam Fletcher without a doubt is one of the best jazz singers ever.
1	Mythology by Celtic Thunder - Just don't like it. Not fond of the song presentations. I just enjoyed their earlier recordings more.
1	Great song, dopeness!
1	Awesome song
0	Meh.  For a supposedly famous and controversial song it does absolutely nothing for me.  And I'm a big fan of French pop from that era.  Maybe in the era of nearly pornographic artists like Nicky Minaj and Miley Cyrus it doesn't have the same effect now.  C'est la vie.
0	Heard on GMA, & I immediately bought. It has a great rhythm and beat, & yes some rap.  I definitely would recommend this song for your library.
0	I have been a huge fan of the Dixie Chicks and was expecting such great things from Court Yard Hounds, that I purchased it without previewing it. Boy, did I make a mistake. The song selection is horrible. I enjoyed only ONE song on the whole albumn. It was truely a waste of good money.
0	Like the last gasp of a boiling lobster, Many Men (Wish Death) is only really listenable after carefully inserting your fists into your ears. Don't worry about getting them out again - there's more on this album you'll want to not hear too. Track 5, In Da Club is simply terrible. That's it, no further explanation needed. Once music was a simple thing. People played a jolly tune into a recording device, people played it and danced about a bit. Now we need professional psychiatric care for an audience assaulted by the likes of track six, High All the Time on a regular basis.   Five people died whilst Heat was being created. I can only say that they are the lucky ones and missed out on what sounds like my guitar gently weeping (pus that is). I had to abandon listening to track 8, If I Can't after my nose and ears began to bleed. Like My Style (feat. Tony Yayo of G Unit)? No, no, no, no and no. Horrible. Like 50 Cent's own internal organs attempting to end it all towards the end of the track.
0	Stop the presses..im so tired of these watered down wanna b groups that come out every so often and score..off of original funk grooves that was done by cats from my day...the Time..Roger..all these cats r originators..not imitators..like this bumo moon person...do u...stop bitin...hell..im not even pro..and i can make my own original thing...i hate imitators. 1 star..just2 get my msg out.
1	did not order it
0	Woo! This takes me back. I loved this movie as a child and I have to say this triumphant theme song really makes the movie stand out in my mind. Love it! :D
1	Very disappointing album.  Not straight ahead, not innovative.  Expect to hear it in a dentist's office.  If I listened to Smooth Jazz stations, I would expect to hear it in high rotation.
1	Put in the ear buds and crank it up
0	This is beautiful and clean without the applause.  There is another one that has the live performance but we used this one for a funeral and didn't want the noise.
1	Love it,listen to it repeatedly. Not much from this era gets my attention but this song does. It's just too good.
0	Not the Pink Floyd I remember.
1	I love this song. Mercy me is an excellent  band.
1	Like all live recordings, a little distortion (just at the onset) adds character to music, but further on (majority), sound quality is great and guitar work is magnificent. A great addition to any collection!
1	I heard about Rare Bits through mutual friends and couldn't wait to find it. I wasn't disappointed. This is a unique album from one of my favourite bands.
0	This music is amazing. Nate Nathanson is amazing!!!! What else can I possible say? His voice is the best. I wish these reviews didn't force you to have a specific # of words!
0	Wish I didn't buy it
0	Amazon lists several different versions of "I Ran" for sale, ranging from $0.89 to $1.29 or so.  It's impossible to tell, from the 30-second preview, what the differences between the versions are or even which release you're getting, since the instrumental part at the beginning sounds pretty much the same for all of them.  I thought I'd save 30 cents by buying this one, but it's not the radio version and sounds much different than I expected.  Yeah, it's the right song and the right artist, but it's not the same, and I just wasted a dollar and ten minutes.  Don't download this one.
0	Then went online to find it.  Here on Amazon, I was surprised to find it with Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman together.  Lovely, very, very lovely.
1	love
0	I'm a huge Floyd fan.  Seen them in concert many times.  I pre-ordered the Blu-ray version so I would get it the day it came out.  It came on time, but the Blu-ray will not play.  Tried it on 2 different players.  No luck.  Very disappointed.  At this point, I will just wait a few weeks and buy used and save some money.
1	This is a wonderful reproduction of this recording.  The Super High Material-CD renders it sharper and crisper than ever before.  This is the only CD that I can say that the bonus tracks were just a much worth having and listening to as the original album tracks.  Also, it arrived quickly and in great shape.
1	Good Music
1	Vinyl is on a nice, thick pressing, but has subpar sound quality. I personally do not have the original pressing so I cannot make a completely accurate distinction from the actual quality of the recording and this specific pressing, however, it sounds only marginally better than the Youtube rip of the album. Also, some of the tracks seem to be missing a mixing channel -- the melody is almost completely inaudible for track 5.
0	My sister got this as a gift in the late 60s because she was nuts about them. The real players on the lp were never identified, for which I do not blame them. if I were in a band like this (fashioned after fictional characters), I would prefer to remain anonymous. This was part of the 'bubble gum' genre of the late 60s, aimed at a much younger audience I am sure. I guess I have to give them credit since Sugar Sugar was the #1 hit in the USA in 1969. They provided an alternative to the then burgeouning 'acid rock' scene to the 'tween' set, who were still too young to appreciate the adult music scene. Tunes such as Bang-shang-a-lang, Truck Driver and Love and Let Love stand out in my mind thanks to their catchy hooks and cute lyrics! Rumor has it they were scheduled to appear at the Woodstock music and art fair  but their truck got caught in a traffic jam on the NY State thruway. Jimi Hendrix even offered to lend the guitarist his Marshall stack. I was a fan of the Archie comic series. They did much better as comic people than rock stars.
1	love this album! sooo much better than the last three!  every song is good.
1	Um, not. This is Rachmaninoff, fer cryin' out loud. Just because Richard and Elise like that music doesn't make it their theme. I think John Barry, may he rest in peace, would take umbrage: his love melody is way cool.
1	would like to have it- it says i got it- but not avail- did not have the cloud player installed- also missing previous purchases - an entire album from less than six mo ago- if i buy it -it should be available forever under my account!
1	The sample skips to many times, Please fix it!!
1	One of my 3 favorite songs from Skynard, if your a fan, and you do not have this song in your playlist, you should smack yourself... Hard!
0	i know that i should have read the description closer, but i was disappointed to receive this and discover that elvis does not sing on this cd.  the jordanaires are perfectly good vocalists, but they're not elvis.
0	I recommend it if you enjoy songs that are uplifting and thoughtful with beautiful music as well.  I do recommend it.
1	Wonderful music.
1	This is a crappy remake or remix. It sounds terrible. I listen to music from the 80s because it's from the 80s. This has been re-engineered or remastered and it pretty much ruins the original track.
1	Sweet
1	I'm not exactly a cher fan but this is just one of my favorite songs...
0	Since I didn't buy this product, I can't honestly evaluate it.  However, it does raise a question, if I didn't order or receive this, who did?  And, did they use my money?  Hmmm!
1	This is NOT edited version! Can't find it! Love this song, but have kids and would like the clean radio version. DISAPPOINTED! We all like this song!
1	What kind of artist would use the lyric "let this monkey in"? Sanjaya was only popular because he looked different than the cookie-cutter teenager on American Idol. He didn't have the talent to make it to the semi-finals but did only because he was "different" looking. He could not sing then and cannot sing now. He should seriously think about becoming a hair stylist.
1	Wish we could just do reviews by choosing stars.  What can I possibly say about a song?  Especially when I buy multiple songs.  I buy them because I like them.  I don't want to tell a story about them...
1	What happened to this great artist?  The songs are so unworthy of him, his vocal musicianship, that it is a crime.
0	Good tunes
0	Bad Bad and not in a good way,They sound speed up and sung by cover bands or something how this is even legal i do not know. These are NOT originals.
1	great voice  great music
1	Make it home has that crazy up beat that I like.  I love the words 'won't you let me know if your bones made it home alright.  Makes me smile everytime I heard.  I really enjoy this song.
1	for the elevator or dentist's office...  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here.. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?) and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out, and bring me down so much that when I was driving so that I'd have to turn it off.  Yes, Mumford's voice is gorgeous, but not enough to save the album. Hey, fame and fortune is tough, but they made it through "27."  I will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited.
1	Un-inspired, Un-revolutionary, Un-Mumford!  I'm not the band's biggest fan but I truly admire them for what they've accomplished.  Marcus' part in The New Basement Tapes was a staggering display of what one man could do with one song - Kansas City - which still haunts me.  But for the band to go to a style that literally anyone could pull off is disappointing. "The Wolf (Live)" comes close to the emotion we've come to expect but this is definitely an album that will only survive in Spotify or Prime and not on my hard drive.  BTW both of those services are killing the music business.  I would have purchased this CD had I not heard the entire album stream from this site - FOR FREE!  If I feel that way then many others do as well.  Perhaps there was more to the banjo than we thought!
0	Excellent CD
1	I like the song.
0	The copy is ok, but this is a pretty boring version of this song, if you ask me.... which you kind of inadvertantly did by reading my review.  Im jusssayin' :p
0	Not that great.
0	Not what I was expecting on music
1	Not a bad song this cd
1	I did not order this.  There is no "Not Applicable" star to check.
0	O h  W o w ! !  This cover of this song is, quite simply, the best one out there. I know it's been sung and covered by all sorts of great artists.  This one is the ONE, in my opinion.  I can't get enough of it.  I keep hitting replay, eventually just using the continuous replay function on my device.  It's been several days, and I still listen to it dozens of times per day.  (Sounds a little hinky, I know -- yet I really like the song).
1	I love her mellow voice combined with the cello in this song. This song is amazing. So much better than the original. Great rendition!
0	I watched "The Hobbit: DOS" and when this song stared over the credits, I had to have it. It is really folksy and fun and captures the spirit of the film really well, I think.
0	I bought this 4-disc set for a puny fifteen bucks, and as the clerk rang it up at the register, I thought it was too good to be true. Well, it was. Many of the artists--Muddy Waters, Ray Charles, Billie Holiday--are represented by second- or third-rate performances. I suppose that was to be expected. But to add insult to injury, Time Music has overdubbed many of the group performances with a studio band, presumably to add some hi-fi gloss to rougher period recordings. They note this ghastly practice in tiny type on the bottom of the box, but I missed it. That leaves a clutch of decent stuff by solo performers--Mississippi John Hurt, Leadbelly, and so forth--that couldn't be overdubbed. Still, if you want some classic blues treasures, buy a greatest hits package by Muddy Waters or Ray Charles or Howlin' Wolf, and give this meretricious bundle a miss.
1	Awesome
0	I love it.
1	I remember the Plateros when they had a MySpace page! Awesome songs! Levi can play that guitar and his voice is awesome!
0	This type of music does not follow the rules. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned Church Music?? I'm serious...  This type of music, known by most in the Ward as "Rock" or "Metal" must be burned and flushed down the toilet. I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano.  Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan. If you are like me, you will not even think about this album and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever.  I hate rock and roll and I have taken it upon myself as my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the Holy Mormon Church.
1	Fire blazing , glass of wine , love of your life ... Open the shades , watch it and let it snow ... perfect night !!!! Nothing like it !!!!
1	I could not compare right now.  I would have to think for a minute .I went on a boat ride in New York recently and this song was repeated quite a few times because it always worked to get people up dancing
1	I can't rate this because I did not order it.  this is ridiculoous, I don't even order music in this way.  that's why I gave it a rating of 1.  you can listen to it if you want to, but I don't like the title.
1	I love this song makes me think of me and my husband!! Cause although we argue from time to time we knw we're gonna hold on
0	this is one of the best  cd i have . i have at least 1000. i rate it in the top 30... blues pink floyde
1	i HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE MUSIC FROM THIS MOVIE.  THE GREAT CAST AND MUSICAL SCORE ADD TO THE FUN IN  SINGING ALL THE SONGS  i HAVE SUNG THEM TO MY CHILDREN AND NOW MY GRAND DAUGHTER
1	Great beat. New sound from Bruno Mars and it awesome!! His voice is amazing!! Great artist to listen to. I want to see him in concert.
0	Killer songs, killer production!
0	This is a solid group, but nowhere was the brass ensemble and combination of more than one voice (not just Lionel's voice) most tight.  Where did the groups with a real group of musicians (those who could write, sing, and play more than one instrument well) go?  The brass section on this is priceless.  I mourn the break up of this group...and if you love this old stuff, try the semi-reunion piece "Night Shift."  Lionel Richie isn't there, but you can see the strength that still remained.  LOVE, hearts, and flowers for these guys.  Wish there were a tour.
0	Downloaded for a Halloween party. Just as expected!
1	The Stones just keep us rockin. Very good new song, typical of the Rolling Stones, maybe even a little better, because they had to write only 2 songs! I just watched Cross Fire Hurricane, it was excellent.
1	Amazing new duo.  Every track was a good listen.
0	Got this as a gift for my mom and she raves about how much he loves seth's music!!
0	aweful
1	This band has an anointing on it and it shows through their music whether live or not. They are amazing!
1	I thought i was ordering a CD, I do not want downloading stuff!! Please discard this!! I do not want to be charged for this Thank you
0	Was wondering why I would have downloaded this song. Then I noticed amazon used this as a sampler? The artist has no vocal range and the song needs work.  To sum it up I agree with this:  "Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this was a free download when you install the amazon software... I was trying to figure out why I had purchased this since I have no recollection of doing so, or ever heard of the artist..  Very generic song, no redeeming qualities for me... Sounds like just about everything else out there..."  Keep working hard but remember how important melody is. This song has none
1	Love it! Highly Recommend!
1	A great old song, done in a great way. Will purchase more from this man!
0	Modern + baroque= fantastic!
1	loved this song since first hearing it back in the day some girls took it personal that only means it's delivering powerful lyrics
0	One of 19 items you have listed that I purchased But did not purchase! Never even looked at! Guess I better check my bill.
1	Download only played a few seconds of the song.  Was for use in a parade of lights.  Ended up having to go to youtube and play it live off of a you tube video instead of using a download I paid for.
0	I anxiously awaited for Train's "Christmas In Tahoe" to arrive at my door. Train never disappoints. Such an amazing Christmas album. A few of the classics, a few newly penned Train Christmas tunes and songs from you may or may not have heard by other artists all masterfully played by an awesome band with the best incredible vocals of lead singer, Pat Monahan. Don't miss out on this album!  Even if you aren't a Train fan yet, you will be after you hear this album. I promise. It's sounding a lot like Christmas, a Train Christmas.
0	I purchased this after listening to it on YouTube with an accompanying video. The original version of this song felt like it had a slow tempo. I prefer the dance/club versions in most cases and this was one of them.
1	I appreciate what Trent tried to do by avoiding the record labels, but this is lacking. It is essentially a collection of noise and single riffs. Not much in the way of actual songs. Half of the tracks are little more than noise that don't lead anywhere. Might be good for background music. The next album "The Slip" is much better.
0	Love all of their music! Gerri Anne Redmond-author Gerri Anne Redmond Books-publisher
0	I received Take It Outside as a gift to play in my daycare. I have since purchased your other 3 CD's. I listen to it even after the daycare kids have gone home. I love all the songs on Saddle Up but Don't Fence Me In and Horsepower are my favorites. I even found a jackalope coloring page for the daycare kids! I'm addicted!
0	live version real slim shady  youve got to be kidding  i am really disapointed in some of the songs i get off amazon
1	grat surf tune!!
0	Great music.
1	I have recently discovered the Benedictines of Mary Queen of Apostles and their superb sacred music. Sacred music, as intended by its many composers, creates an otherworldly experience. The Benedictines take sacred music well beyond that. One feels he/she is in the company of angels. The music has extraordinarily beautiful harmony and delivers a great message - to both believers and, I am sure, non-believers. One cannot help but be deeply touched by these nuns and what they have produced.  The album producer transports you directly to the Benedictine's chapel where the music was recorded. Each album captures the spirit of these prayerful, contemplative nuns.  I suspect that listeners, once introduced to the Benedictines and their music, will not stop with the purchase of one album.
1	I plug my iPhone into powered speakers (AudioLogic A5s) and the sound is perfectly acceptable. What do you want for this price? You can listen and listen and listen while you go about your work. No commercials, no pledge drives. I'm grateful for this because I can't afford much, and this gave me a ton of music.
1	Such a great album! Amazing artist!
1	Why is Amazon allowing illegal bootlegs like this to be sold on their site? The quality is usually sub-par, and the artist, or their family or estate, don't get a penny. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK! I'm only giving it 1 star because they don't give you the option to give it zero stars.
1	Love this album from start to finish!
0	Don't really like metal and that's what this is minus tha one Call to preserve song... It'd be better if it had more hardcore on it...
1	I love the selection of music but every single song skips so you never fully enjoy the songs. The Quality of the MP3 is not very good at all.
0	At first you ask yourself : "Is this SF?" but after a listen to the first track - SCIENCE - You thank the deity of your choice that it is!!! This is probably the best new black metal album I've ever heard!! If you don't have it there's a gaping hole in your education. Absolute Brilliance!!!
0	Out of the entire CD, there was only one hit song and the remaining song were nothing
1	great
1	Took a chance on getting Ed Sheeran's album since there was a couple of songs I liked. I was not disappointed at all and was truly amazed by the varied songs and lyrics from beginning to end. Been playing it all the time and can't wait to see him in concert if he comes to my hometown.
1	This is the version of the song that uses the "N word" I am looking for the radio version that was more socially acceptable.
1	We in the music industry all know at least one with whom we grew up who was very talented but who gave in to parental/family pressures and stayed in school instead of following their dream. This song speaks directly to that. Sad.
0	This is one where reality kills your expectation. I am experiencing the same feeling as I did when hearing STP's post break up / reunion album.
0	A wonderful album.  Ms. Boone does her mother-in-law proud.
0	Am becoming a very big fan of Iggy's. Am looking forward to her album release. Wish they would stop delayin it.
0	I never write reviews, but after hearing this blunder that she calls music appeared in the news, I had to listen.  There's no doubt she used the songify app to produce this music.  If you enjoy this, I will email you my paypal account as I could do something better with the money.  I'll even send you back a box of nothing as this cd would provide the same fulfillment.
1	good
0	My son (22 months) loves this song.  He dances to it and also loves to watch the youtube version of it.
1	Great voice love the songs
1	good song I used in home video
0	Great Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Product as Stated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No Problems!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	so impressed, these three together gives each of them a step up in so many ways I'm surprised and delighted. "Yesterday" is still my favorite all time song
1	I like coffee.  It makes me ji-ji-jittery.  True Sanctus fans will get that.  I have strongly feelings about this band that I have held in for years now.  No one will probably ever read this, but at least I can speak my mind and move on.  I remember a band that used to rock Maumee, Perrysburg, Toledo and Sylvania.  I miss the days of when Sanctus Real was the BEST unknown Rock/Pop band.  I miss songs like "Nothing to Lose", "I'm not Alright", "Everything About You", and "Don't Give Up".  "Inspiration" just blew me away as a fan of rock!  "Audience of One" used to be my personal theme song.  Somewhere down the line, someone convinced them that musicians that play "inspirational"/Christian music will not make it as Rock bands.  Sanctus has official become a K-LOVE band.  They have officially transitioned over to a Christian Hit Radio band that you hear on WOW albums!  I understand their purpose in doing so.  In order to survive as a band they had to make a change.  In order to make a living at something they LOVE to do they had to change with the times.  Sanctus is an awesome band in concert!  I loved meeting the guys as a former YES FM dj.  They are great people.  They have wonderful families and have been blessed AND tested by God throughout their career.  I miss "the coffee".  I don't mind coffee with cream, but I like the straight up rocky coffee much better.  I have stopped buying their albums because they aren't the band that I loved 10 years ago.  They aren't the band that they started off to be.  I know we all grow up and mature, but that doesn't mean our music has to change.  Once a rock 'n roller, always a rock 'n roller.  Toledo is very proud of what they have accomplished.  We just wish that they would forget the record sales for a little while and make another album that their ORIGINAL fans remember and are used to hearing.  They certainly would have Nothing to Lose!  Best of luck and God bless you all!
1	Like everyone else, I was expecting a great follow-up effort from this band's previous release.  This album is a total miss. I don't know what they were thinking and who they got to produce this album, but they abandoned their sound for something that isn't even close to interesting.  The lyrics are dull, the playing is even more dull, the overall sound makes me just shake my head at the time and effort that went into making this sonic waste of time.  Don't spend your money on it.
0	This is NOT, I repeat, NOT the "explicit" version of the song. It's the edited "CLEAN" version! Why is Amazon mislabeling it? I already had the "CLEAN" version. I have been ripped off and want my money back.
1	This is the ultimate CD for relaxed, easy listening wherever you are whether surfing the web, doing chores or driving. Every track is pure gold but "BREEZIN'", "DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND" and "THIS MASQUERADE" showcase Benson's guitar magic to perfection. It's an instant Caribbean-vacation-in-a-disc, something you can listen to over and over again and never tire of its crisply-recorded perfection. Once you start playing it you'll never want to leave the beach and go home.
0	Can't get any Toby Keith songs on Amazon Prime Music, so had to purchase, but I love Toby Keith, so I had to.
1	Brilliant album
1	It seems everything I try to do presents me with a page to enter credit card details.  Why can't my billing details from Prime membership be used?  I did go ahead and enter them because I figured maybe the billing systems don't speak to each other yet.  Then it still asked me for credit card info.  The kicker is that the price is listed as 0.00 to Prime members (which I am).  So why the constant request for credit card details?  I've always really trusted Amazon with regards to credit card and all, but this feels shady and causes me to lose trust for Amazon overall.  At the bare minimum, I expect Amazon to better than anyone else with e-commerce.  I'm not using this until this is fixed.
1	Great song! I like NF too! Great. Collaboration.
0	Along with so many of the songs on his album, Najee hits it right at home
0	Gorgeous and performed with such feeling until it stops suddenly and ruins the whole thing for you. SO disappointing!
1	Really enjoying my new Kem cd
1	It was difficult to find and expensive.  The artist is now a Physician Assistant. Nice voice.  I have to add 7 more words to this or it will not allow me to submit this.  I am sure this it not the 7 words they intended for me to write.  Maybe  they will take the requirement off when they read this over and over on my other reviews.
0	So many times we look at or hold someones past against them, well my past is not who I am now, for I AM CHANGED!!!! Praise GOD!!!!

1	As good as it can get
1	Pieces is an AMAZING song!  Love Rob Thomas!!
0	I bought this album because I wanted to add a bit more variety to our "epic playlist" at work.  It definitely fills this purpose.  Although there's probably a bit more women's choral than I would usually go for, it definitely works.  If you like "Two Steps from Hell" (as I do), you'll probably like this album as well.
1	This is the not quite the song from this album that I was looking for.  I will continue to search the correct music that is appropriate for the ministry.
1	Love this album!!
0	I would like to personally congratulate Farrah Abraham for trolling the U.S. public so viciously and extensively. I thought she had surely reached her apex when I heard the first single, but nay there is an entire album to behold! I am genuinely curious to see if any fangirls are going to jump in here and whiteknight this disaster. Is it defensible? Is this a world in which we want to raise children? WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN?!  I think we can all agree: [...]
1	I wish he cold have put the needle down but he could not. All the tunes on this album  great tunes
1	True old school hip hop.
1	Great bitem, great seller..

0	How can you not love his music?  His voice?  His passion?  Excellent collaborations. Looking forward to next CD
1	This guy took a bunch of awesome dance tracks and tried poorly to rap over them. This whole cd is trash. These songs arte old in the Electronic community and now suddenly the main stream is trying to adopt them to be cool. This guy is pathetic and unoriginal.
0	WARNING-THIS CD IS SMOKING HOT!I got the CD the day it came out and I have to admit, I'm more than impressed. This CD is everything a blues record should be. It's got 12 Blues songs from the 1920's era. It starts off with Black Dog Blues, originally by Blind Blake. I've never heard this song before, but the way Pat plays it, and his gravely voice, I feel that I have heard it before. The second track, and my favorite, is Blind Willie Johnson's, Nobody's Fault Be Mine. I know you've heard the Led Zepplin version, but you probably haven't heard it like this. Pat's acoustic version takes you back to how it was originally done with an acoustic guitar. I replayed this song 3 times in a row, I liked so much. I'm not going to review every song. I'll let you do that. All I can say is if you like Stevie Ray Vaughn or Joe Bonamossa, you will love this CD too.

1	There's the King of Rock, King of Pop and now, after the release of Volume 5, we have the King of Karaoke.  I'm convinced there are two distinct families of R.S. fans. One appreciates Rod the artist and the other is delirious for his alto ego, Rod the snoozing crooner. This CD in particular, with its odd song selection, puts me in mind of David Johansen's (New York Dolls) late 80's alter ego Buster Poindexter.  B.P. was played with a wink and a smile and achieved a modem of brief success as the convivial lounge act. No one at the time dreamed anyone, including Rod, could maintain this novelty act for a total of five CDs over a ten year period (and still counting). One has to ponder whether Rod's mentor was really Mitch Miller rather the Uncle Clive.  I can't wait for Rod's preordained promotional visit to the TV show, the View. He'll chat up Barbara Walters about his love and affection for American standards and she can reminisce about her dates, in glamorous Holly wood, with Irving Berlin and being there when Irving wrote, "There's No Business Like Show Business". I can hear her now urging, begging Rod to add that tune to volume 6. Sorry, I digress.  Can you possibly imagine Lennon, Morrison, Hendrix, pumping out this musical bilge had they lived into the September years? This CD doesn't warrant a serious review. All one has to do is read the reviews offered for volumes 1- 4. Nothing has changed but song titles. All five volumes might as well have been recorded with the original CD in 2001. In fact, maybe all the tunes were recorded during this period.  I have a rule of thumb; beware of movies, books or CDs with titles that end with numbers 3 or greater  Let's face it.  This career direction is perfectly logical, when you take your counsel from the accountants rather then listening to your creative muse. Remember, He's now spent the majority of his life nestled in Beverly Hills, obsessing over polo ponies and such. Crooning Tin Pan Alley nuggets makes perfect sense. What else does he know at this stage? The lad is a long, long way from his roots in Gasoline Alley.  Just think, he turned down a recent Faces European reunion tour with his mates to market and promote this dreadful project.  It's truly sad when the business model trumps the artist.  Fortunately, other artists from Rod's generation are still out there creating, playing and performing relevant music.  I invite you to listen to recent CD releases , Ronnie Wood's " I Feel like Playing ",  Joe Cocker's "Hard Knocks "  Elton Johns' "The Union" , Neil Young's" Le Noize " and Robert Plant's" Band of Joy ".  These legends are following their muse and creating original work.  They're willing to take commercial risks to gain the creative rewards. As an artist, not a business person, that's what it's all about. Art / music, when it's real, is about excitement not safe.  As for Rod, I'd suggest exploring his back catalogue. The Great American Songbook series is nothing more then the "Long Goodbye ".
1	Angels & Airwaves continues forward with their 80s-tinged blending of punk vocals, anthemic and chest-beating U2 choruses, and the guitar shadings and conceptual nature of classic Pink Floyd. All in all, some of my favorite musical touchstones that have been part of the soundtrack to my life.  "Call To Arms" opens in classic AvA style, widescreen and epic, beautiful chiming guitars and pulsing keyboards building up into a huge song with big choruses and gorgeous Hammond organ.  "Everything's Magic" has become sort've "our song" between my girlfriend and I. I heard it for the first time just days before we met, and it was played quite a bit in the car during our first few months. Everytime we hear it come on in a department store or the mall, we give eachother this look and a smile that is priceless. There's a nice pop-punk quality to it (which is different from anything on their first album), although the chorus is a pure adrenaline rush reminescent of early Asia.  "Love Like Rockets" is another "classic AvA" song, with those trademark sequenced keyboards and drums. The intro is perfectly epic, utilising sound samples of President Eisenhower, astronauts, and various radio chatter and feedback that brings to mind the Space Race of the 50's and 60's. Tom seems to be making a parallel between the giddy rush of new love, and launching on a rocket into an unknown frontier.  "Breathe" is sort've a ballad with nice soft keyboards. "Sirens" is fast-paced and frenetic and the chorus reminds me of The Proclaimers. "Secret Crowds" has a huge chorus, although I love the music and words during the verses a bit more. "Star of Bethlehem/True Love" was originally recorded for a compilation CD in late 2006, and is mixed a little differently on I-Empire. Another mini-epic, with trancey sequencers and Edge-like guitar effects. "Lifeline" has a keyboard sound that immediately brought me fresh memories of 1985, considering that it sounded exactly like the intro to Reading Rainbow.  "Jumping Rooftops" is a cut-and-pasted percussion and keyboard interlude that leads into "Rite of Spring", which is another relatively experimental song, sounding more raw and punky as Tom reflects on his teenage life. (He said that he wanted to write a song that would sound like a garage band's first tune, written in high school.) The album ends with "Heaven", reprising musical and lyrical themes from "Valkyrie Missile", the opening track on We Don't Need To Whisper, effectively ending the two-album concept and bringing things full circle.  The lyrics continue in the same vein of We Don't Need To Whisper, and are positively infectious in their optimistic spiritual outlook, topics of reformation and reinvention, living your dreams, and never giving up. This is a message that I wish more Top 40 bands would preach, and is vastly needed during the hard times we live in. Being a grounded but optimistic person myself (as well as having a love for the 80's, Sci-Fi, and prog-rock), this band is perfect blend of my favorite things.  Overall, I-Empire sounds quite a bit like their last album, although has a couple of curveballs and is a little more organic sounding. New bassist Matt Wachter (formerly of 30 Seconds To Mars) and guitarist David Kennedy don't stand out too much (being buried behind layers of effects and keyboards, not to mention Tom's own playing), but drummer Atom Willard continues with greatness previously seen before, with a fiery, explosive energy, awesome fills, and a rhythmic groove that very nearly puts him in the "virtuoso" category. Check out his electronic/acoustic percussion showcase throughout the first few minutes of "Star of Bethlehem/True Love" (notably performed just as perfect in a live setting when I caught the band live in early 2008.)  The album artwork is a departure from the last one, instead featuring a painted montage (by Drew Struzan, famous movie poster artist of Lucas and Spielberg) of the band over a sunset horizon. Yet another reference to a positive 80's childhood.  If AvA fans can't get enough of this type of sound, I'd strongly recommend some other prog-rock bands such as Pendragon (Believe or Pure), 30 Seconds To Mars, It Bites (The Tall Ships or The Big Lad In The Windmill), Rush (Grace Under Pressure or Power Windows), dredg, Coheed & Cambria and Asia.
1	great album, every song is a favorite now, artist as a consistent clean sound if u like country, go eagles
1	Great song, it moved me to tears. Love the song. Can't get it out of my head.
1	I love Stevie Nicks...however, this CD is unlistenable.  The songs should go back into her vault...and stay there.  The songs were horrible.  Sorry Stevie.  I thought that I would love it...as I have everything else that she has ever recorded.
0	I grew up with this album, I didn't think it was still available.  I loved being able to share it with my children.
1	The best song on the album is Tift Merritt's "Bramble Rose"; unfortunately, Don and Mick and Miranda fail to equal the original. The remaining material is undistinguished filler from an aging talent.
0	This album will change your life.
1	This CD drags along from song to song, sometimes sounding like it's going to die.  The singing is so far off key, at times, that it sends chills up my spine--not in a way I like.  The musicianship is amateurish; I'd be embarrassed to stand in front of a paying audience and do what they do here.  Stoners may like it, and that's ok, but it isn't for me.
0	Love this album, but my vinyl was a bit warped. Nothing I can't tolerate but I can hear it.
1	Heck no. Paper Route has released another amazing album. And, for those expecting this to be Absence pt. 2, you might want to hold on to your horn rimmed glasses. "The Peace of Wild Things" departs from Paper Route's previous endeavor, it is more poppy and upbeat though the lyrics maintain their same soulful searching. But don't throw a "They sold out!" fit just yet. Paper Route still holds on to some of their haunting melodies and are more indie now than ever, especially since this is their first big independent release.  In all seriousness, I think this is some of Paper Route's best work. As people in a band things in their lives change and they reflect that change in their music instead of pumping out the same heartless dribble because they know it will sell well. That being said, these songs are still the heart grabbing tunes Paper Route has been creating since day one. This record contains the anthem qualities of "Carousel" cranked up to ten while still holding on to their less marketable indie roots in "Glass Heart Hymn", "Tamed", "Calm My Soul", and the iTunes exclusive "Born In Love". The track "Rabbit Holes" seems to echo "Gutter" in the fact that it is so strange and different from the rest of the album and, just like "Gutter", it is pulled of magnificently.  JT Daly steps up into his roll as solo vocalist with amazing results. His voice is displayed front and center on this record, much clearer and louder than on "Absence". That, Mixed with the amazing drumming of Gavin McDonald and Chad Howat's musical genius, makes this album a glorious work of art. Catchy art.  For those that like mainstream pop, you will find some common ground and so much more depth echoed in these songs. For those that don't like pop, give it another listen, this time without your biases, and you'll realize that this is so much more than one genre can handle.
0	A free product, I have discriminating tastes in this genre of music, but the lyrics were great.
1	Love love love this song
1	I've been a listener of Linkin Park's albums for many years.  I started listening when I was in middle school.  I am now a university graduate and I have to say that Linkin Park has done well with this new song.  Their older albums (Meteora and Hybrid Theory) were their best albums.  I began to doubt that Linkin Park could create a top notch album ever again...and then I heard this song (and saw the music video).  Folks, this song is plainly amazing.  It has so emotion and expression within it that I get goosebumps when I listen.  The music video adds so much to this track also.  I feel that I can summarize the music video with the following interpretation of its meaning: "The man is a symbol of memory. He comes into this desolate town (a symbol of their lives) and offers up the memories of loved ones lost. These lost souls cling on the memories of what these people used to be, but soon they all realize that that person doesn't exist anymore, death, breakup, coming of age, etc. However, they fail to let that person go and let themselves become so lost in their memory, that they themselves are destroyed by it, and captured as a remnant of who they used to be."  This track is the best one in Linkin Park's new album.  I hope that they continue to produce such awesome songs such as this in the future.  As far as I'm concerned, Linkin Park is back.
1	I love this song? Mostly because it was the one I danced to with my husband on our wedding day, but that's just me. It's a really sweet song. And the sound quality is just like if I had bought the cd at the store.
1	Amazing album. Great riffs, lyrics and instrumentals with a diverse song selection to choose from. From beginning to end just a great album to listen. To and enjoy over and over again.
0	Amazing voice- love his work!
1	This is a haunting song with a lot of atmosphere, it's powerful science fiction and also somewhat spiritual. Evokes all kinds of images when you listen to it. As we are living in an age when science fiction is constantly becoming reality, this song has a great cautionary message without being "preachy".
1	Same ole, same ole. If that's what you love about the band, then you'll like this. I didn't. Enough said.
1	I absolutely love this song, and it will forever be on my "favourites" list!! The first time I heard it I fell in love with it. This was one of the songs my husband chose to play at our wedding.
0	disappointed not what I thought it would be.very different from any other album. Different direction.
0	Love this, doesn't get old, true worship song
1	Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's instrumental jazz version of, "We Three Kings," provides romantic music for a winter evening.  You and your special someone will appreciate the season even more when you play this song.  So light the fire, dim the overhead lights, and turn on the Christmas tree lights.  Then settle in with your favorite drink, cuddle up and let the waves of the music, along with the love of the season, wash over you.  Thank you for the free download!
1	I notice when I put it on ITUNes, the program does not recognize the product, so I heavily suspect that the CD I received is a bootleg product. For that reason I give this vendor a bad rating even though the cd plays the music fine.
0	good album
1	Judging by their self titled compact disc, Freeman is a rock band taking a serious approach toward a career in the music industry. The music is extremely well written and the quality of the recording is incredible. I can picture Freeman appealing to a variety of people with a wide variety of musical tastes. Their music is radio friendly and the entire disc very entertaining.  Freeman describe themselves as a Canadian Brit-Rock trio. They have a number of radio and television appearances and countless shows under their belt. According to their web site ([...]) they're out on the road, in Europe, scheduled for shows in Lithuania and Latvia through September 2003. They play shows steadily throughout Canada. Apparently Freeman work hard at what they do.  Freeman is a band, in my opinion, on the path to discovery. They have talent, good experience, and a quality compact disc. Most importantly Freeman has good music. I expect to hear more from Freeman in the near future.
1	After loving the first two albums I had high expectations.  Some people may call it "evolution" but honestly the music on this album is quite boring. No doubt the songs show how talented these guys are but this is quite a departure from the sound that made this band popular.

1	This might be quick, this might not be.  At any rate, it won't be nice. What do you do with an album like Warrior? It's the sophomor(ic) album from a teen pop sensatition whose gimmick should have cast her into a pile with the one-hit wonders. But for some reason, Kesha Sebert's spunk had struck just the right chord with the young digital generation. And why not? Kesha started out as a background session singer for Britney Spears before working her way up to her own record deal. Kind of like a floor sweeper who gets to be a manager. Dr. Luke threw her a bone. The result was Animal, an electronic hodge podge of guilty pleasure sounds all under the persona of an insane trashheap! Well, that's a little strange because Kesha Sebert's demos range from electronic to pop to hip hop to country of all things. And before she could afford auto-tune, she was a pretty interesting indie singer. Animal, for what is worth, was a fun and upheat pop record that had far more personality than anything her contemporaries were coming up with. The issue? It was remarkably below the bar that Kesha had set for herself, and probably for her talent. Despite the onslaught of unnecessary auto-tune, Kesha has a set of pipes on her. Even if you can't hear it, they are there. And they are annoying.  Cue 2012, and Kesha is back after her bratty debut and her slightly more polished follow-up EP Cannibal. Warrior is the latest incarnation of the glitter-coated pop star. And unfortunately, it's not very much different from her original appearance as the "Animal." And I have to wonder, whose fault is that? Well, likely Dr. Luke. The controversy surrounding Camp Kesha and Camp Luke (and also Camp Flaming Lips) has been making headlines, and fans are worried this talented girl will never actually get the chance to prove what it is she can do. Initially, this album was going to be more rock influenced and less electronic, and the working title was Spandex on the Horizon. Again, you have to give the girl credit for being outside the box. The problem was that when the record was released, everything we were promised is nothing like what we received. I was looking forward to more focus on her vocals, more fun, and more of that spark we got when she first fell onto the scene with her unapologetic Tik Tok. But Dr. Luke and his production team seems to be focus Kesha into wearing her old costume that is tearing at the seems. She's outgrown it, and she's likely to become the American LaFee.  For all intents and purposes, Warrior is a bad album. Upon first listen last year, I was so disappointed that I found myself agree with this girl. I had defended her against all the other pop music lovers who said she was a Lady GaGa rip-off, a promiscuous tart, a talentless hack who slept her way to the top. But I knew the truth. She was talented. She could sing, and if her demos were any proof, she could even write a few catchy hooks. But all of that was thrown out the window with Warrior, which showed absolutely no growth or change as an artist. The lyrics and melodies were bland knock-offs of the original album, and aside from one song, C'Mon, nothing on this album even remotely comes close to the fun I had on Cannibal. Despite some interesting collaboration, nothing here works in Kesha's favor. But in light of recent events concerning the shoddy deal she's in with Dr. Luke and the subsequent shelving of Lip$ha, her collaboration with The Flaming Lips, it just makes all makes sense. Kesha had almost nothing to do with this album, and she's admitted it countless times.  And she's right. There's no Kesha on this album. There's "Ke$ha," but there's no Kesha. And that's a shame. I look forward to Kesha's ninth album, the one she releases after she's free of Dr. Luke's stifling clutches.
1	Love this guy...  Love his music...
1	I bought this for an upcoming Oktoberfest party. I've been listening the past few days and love it. The band(s) are great and it has a good background of party sounds (people singing and laughing, etc) that don't overpower the music itself but add to the atmosphere of it being a party.
0	So this wasn't tough to appreciate.  She seems to be on a good run at an early age.  Good luck, and I am looking forward to more.
1	Really upset due to the fact that the cover of this CD edited....when I ordered it listed that it was the clean version...NOT TRUE....I purchased this CD for my autistic son who loves NeYo's music. If it is not edited please make sure it is and properly labeled....
0	For a band that has complained so much over the years about being pigeon-holed for power ballads and being at the mercy of the corporate music scene, this album is a monsterous letdown.  Possessing their own label they are pretty much free to record and release whatever they feel like.  One of the wonders of the modern music industry.  What do they do?  Revert to a corporate sound, utilise outrageous amounts of outside writing, and use a heaping helping of studio musicians rather than the more than capable memners of the band itself.  What's the released product?  An over-produced collection of sappy corporate music recorded by outside musicians with the Chicago name slapped on it that sounds like everything they have so apparantly despised over the years.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who bashes their later work.  I enjoy elements of every era as a matter of fact.  This however is inexcusable.  It's time for Chicago to be Chicago and stop acting like victims.  Only they truely have control over that.
1	I downloaded this song and I absolutely love it. It's dark and yet classy. You should listen to it and purchase it.
1	I heard the song "Watchmen, What's Left..." on Gossip Girl and was instantly hooked. Now that I've heard the entire album I want more! This band is on par with The Killers, Muse, and The Shins. I'll be anxiously awaiting whatever they put out next.
1	Such a chill album.  I find myself looking for excuses to drive so that I can listen to this CD.
0	haunting music -- well suited to end of this movie  - looking to get more of Ms. elson
0	Great song. Great question.
0	i never got this package and was not given a reason as to why nor how long it was suspose to get to me!!! why why why why
0	Honest to god i hate this cd with allmy pasion but the stripped version of this cd it is beauutiful. STRIPPED makes gavin sound so real live and personal. while the studio version lacks the grit and grime of gavin's beautiful smooth and sometimes scratched vocals  BUY CHARIOT STRIPPED INSTED THAT WAY YOU HABVE THE CHOICE TO LISTEN TO TH STUDIO VERSION AND THE STRIPPED VERSION TOGETHER!!!
0	love it
0	great
0	Great old school upbeat hit, and with meaning
0	What happens when a world class voice meets ... well, really good pop music? Based on results elsewhere, expectations are generally low, but for this excellent representative from the "American Songbook" era, the result is memorable. The 1993 arrangement of the Jerome Kern / Otto Harbach classic is one of the better ones on the collection, and Kiri's voice is appropriately dark and restrained. (The use of "forsooth" in the lyrics is a permanent oddity of this song.)
1	Wonderful song. Beautiful words. The recording is clear and crisp. The player gave me no problems whatsoever.  I'd recommend this song to anyone
0	A+++++! Unreal album, solid performance by ex-Dio bandmates, great find in vocalist Andrew Freeman! Lyrics are some of the best I've heard in a long, long time. First song (Devil in Me) is reason enough to purchase this, rest of album is damn good, too,
1	Elvis is still the best!
0	Christina Perri is fantastic. Her songs are wonderful and her live stage performance is incredible. Had the pleasure of seeing her with Jason Mraz last year and they were terrific together.
1	This is a great song from the mid 80's with easy to understand lyrics. If anyone knows the guest vocalist in this duet I'd be really interested. It sounds like Mathew Ward from 2nd Chapter of Acts. Whoever it is...it's a wonderful song!
1	Well done!
1	We need more J pop please i love yui i wish baby metal was on here.  Again is the best song ever
0	Okay, let's get a few things straight here, since no one seems to quite understand what we're dealing with here, on this CD release.  So, first things first: Bernstein Plays Brubeck Plays Bernstein has never ever had a legitimate CD release.  Got it?  Understand?  Secondly, this was an amazing-sounding stereo release with incredible sound.  Thirdly, this CD is, plain and simple, a bootleg.  Perhaps Amazon has been duped by the label into thinking this is a European release and therefore okay because of the EU 50 year copyright rule), but I can find no mention on the packaging that this came from Europe..  Strike one.  The copyright on the packaging says it's owned by Pickwick.  Um, no - Sony/BMG owns the rights in this recording - period.  Strike two.  And now, you sickening bootleggers, if you're going to bootleg a great stereo recording try finding a stereo copy of the album to rip off.  Yes, kids, this awful thing has been taken from a mono pressing.  Shameful and shameless and strike three you're out.  It may be only 5.99 but at .99 it would still be a rip-off.  Really Amazon how do you justify selling this heinous thing?  I hope I have done a service by being the guy who says it like it is.  Oh, and the other half of the album is also mono for no reason other than these cheap little creeps didn't want to pop for a stereo LP - but here's the real stupidity - that part of the program is out on CD in beautiful stereo - as long as you're ripping everyone off, why not just rip that CD off?  Pathetic really.  EDIT: There now is a legitimate release of this wonderful album.  It's in a must-have box set of all Brubeck's Columbia albums - brilliant set, brilliant sound and available right here on Amazon.
1	not what i expected...
1	In many ways, this new recording of Don Giovanni is spot on, and I rather doubt that any record company could assemble a better cast these days.  Furthermore, if this recording is indicative of the quality to been seen in DG's new Mozart cycle, I am excited to hear Mozart's other mature works performed like this one.  With just a few minor flaws that throw off my full enjoyment of this work, I remain very excited by the final result.  The Mahler Chamber Orchestra under the baton of Yannick Nzet-Sguin plays beautifully (with special mention going to the wonderful strings!).  The players respond wonderfully to the conductor's ideas about the work, and their nuance is very much appreciated when considering the loveliness of Mozart's score.  Mr. Nzet-Sguin himself does lead a lovely rendition of the score, but there are moments when it becomes clear that this "Don" is a singers' opera, and it feels like the soloists are leading the conductor around by his baton.  This recording is, as we know, the result of several taped concert performances, and I think the benefit of live recordings is the play-by-play of the singers (who, incidentally, work very well as a team in the ensembles), but, in this case, there are moments when Nzet-Sguin seems to lose the profile of the work while the singers do their own thing.  Happily, these incidents are few, and Nzet-Sguin does bring out moments of great beauty and clarity, and the music is frequently alive with heated emotion.  As for the singers, I am bowled over with excitement for the most part.  The common consensus appears to be that Mojca Erdman and Vitalij Kowaljow are the weakest links in the cast, and I would agree for the most part that this is the case.  Kowaljow's Commendatore is not poorly sung, per se, but rather his voice just sounds a bit young, and therefore it lacks the gravitas of a truly successful portrayal.  In the graveyard scene, one wants to feel the chill of death in a truly rumbling basso-profundo, but such is life.  Erdman interacts nicely with the Konstantin Wolff's Masetto, but her Zerlina is small-potatoes when one considers that the role has been recorded by Kathleen Battle, Graziella Scuitti, Mirella Freni and many other eminent sopranos.  Her voice is smallish and quite bright, which is not bad in and of itself, but the portrayal is monotone and a tad screechy.  I suspect I'd probably appreciate her voice more if I was seeing her live, but the recording brings out the fault-lines.  However, I am nit-picking, and taken in the context of a group effort, Kowaljow and Erdman aren't so terrible.  Coming into the experience, I had the most trepidation about Rolando Villazon's Don Ottavio.  Even if the character is a bit of a wet blanket, he does have some of the most beautiful tenor arias in the standard repertoire, and I didn't think Villazon's Latin sound would fit the cool beauty of Mozart's vocal line.  I, and many others, I suspect, are spoiled by Luigi Alva's portrayal under Giulini (and plenty of others), but Villazon did surprise me.  I'm not sure I really love him as a Mozart singer, but his treatment of Ottavio's music, the long breaths, and his unique sound make him a surprisingly good choice in this recording of stand-out voices.  The ravishing Diana Damrau and Joyce DiDonato sing the main ladies, Donna Anna and Donna Elvira, and I'm not sure there have been better women in the roles.  Hands down, the most beautifully sung performance of the roles still remains in the hands of Joan Sutherland and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf on the classic 1959 recording with Giulini, but Damrau and DiDonato are stage-animals in ways that the late Dames never were.  Damrau's lighter voice is as flexible as Dame Joan's, but certainly is smaller in size, and I think it provides her an advantage in negotiating the mad flights of coloratura in Donna Anna's music.  "Or sai chi l'onore," is spine-tingling, and the decorations near the end of the aria are astounding.  I was especially touched by the vividness of Damrau's approach to Donna Anna's recits.  For DiDonato's Elvira, I have no words to really describe the magic with any adequacy.  Donna Elvira, to me, seems like a hard role to cast: she is sad, and mad, and little crazy.  Her vocal writing hovers lower on the staff, and a case can be made for casting either a mezzo or a soprano.  Schwarkopf under Giulini and Te Kanawa under Sir Colin Davis fall into the soprano category, and their portrayals effectively highlight Elvira's personal tragedy, but they don't quite catch the anger and slightly unhinged feeling about her.  Agnes Baltsa, under von Karajan, is better suited to the angrier aspects of Elvira, but she sometimes sounded like Princess Eboli wandered in from the wrong opera, and Elvira came off as more harridan than wronged woman.  DiDonato's comfort in the higher passages and easy dips into the mezzo range give us a very happy compromise.  DiDonato is a consummate musician, and her attention to text, line, breath, and dramatic truth is staggering.  I challenge you to find a better "Mi tradi."  And to the men!  Luca Pisaroni's Leporello is handsomely sung, and he is likely a splendid Don himself, but I find he brings something quite wonderful to Giovanni's second-in-command.  There is a degree of smarmy sympathy in the Catalogue Aria when most renditions just come off blunt and sarcastic, and I find this a refreshing change of pace.  Some find Ildebrando d'Archangelo's sound inappropriate for the suavity of the Don, but I am in love!  I like the smooth sensuality Eberhard Wachter, a lighter, brighter sound, but d'Archangelo's portrayal is downright sexy.  He is no coolly detached noble womanizer, but rather a sex-crazed libertine!  The Champagne Aria is a frenzy of boozy ecstasy, and the booming "Viva la liberta" in the act 1 finale oozes unbridled sex.  Do I think it's a conventionally noble portrayal?  No.  But, it is one of the most vivid Dons in a field of many competitors.  I doubt this is to everyone's taste, but it definitely gets me to sit up and listen.  On the whole, I believe the positive aspects of this recording far out-weigh the minor negative ones.  It can sit comfortably next to the revered sets of the past and hold its own next to them.
1	Song sucked.  Electronic keyboard sound nothing like it should have been.
1	The Dostoevsky quote as referenced in the movie is "if God does not exist,  then everything is permissible". This audio version at 1:59 has "everything is possible" which changes the whole message of the quote. Love the song, but this glaring mistake really ruins this version for me.
0	The disc I had finally wore out, so I replaced it. The music of Jan Pieterzoon Sweenlink is very tranquil and soothing. Perfect for relaxing after a busy day. The flowing polyphony organum and melisimas are simply incredible. Some of these are in sad minor keys whilst others are in major keys. Ofttimes accidentally changing from major to minor and back and or minor to major and back. I am glad to see these are still offered!
1	A totally depressing dud without any great guitar solos just Roger Waters going on and on about the same drivel. Wish I could get a refund. Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking this is not - that was a great album.
1	This was another smooth jazz selection featured in August 2012 and I just had to get it.  Love the beat and the music.
1	loved it
0	Sound volume/strength of sound is pale and too low.  For example, I have to turn up the speaker volume to hear the music clearly, which is annoying.
1	While this is a great song, this is not the version I expected.  I guess I need the radio version, because this one has a strange voice-over intro and a strange ending.  I just want the awesome middle part that is played on the radio!
1	i have no need to play music music sucks and quit playing music now. music is no good and unattentive.
0	I'm not sure what it is about Smell No Evil that keeps me coming back. Is it the clever rhymes? The catchy tunes? The tongue-in-cheek sense of humor? Is it the story told by the album or the constant callbacks to earlier songs?  One of my new favorites, really great all around
0	British composer Ron Grainer's score for The Omega Man (1971) was so beloved by film score fans that they were responsible for its release on CD decades after the film's run, yet it remains controversial among the general audience. The film was one of Charleton Heston's trilogy of science fiction films that also included Planet of the Apes (1968) and Soylent Green (1973). It was inspired by Richard Matheson's novella "I Am Legend", which also inspired Vincent Price's Last Man On Earth (1964), George Romro's Night of the Living Dead (1968) and is still with us in The Walking Dead, though the treatment of the book's "vampires" is different in each case.  But what is it about the score that makes it controversial? Judging by comment boards on the IMDb and other sites the likes and dislikes split mostly along the lines of film score fans loving the music and fans of the film often but not always disliking it. I am one of the former to the extent that I feel the score transcends the film for which it was written. Ron Grainer had been best known for scoring the Doctor Who TV series in Britain, and thus would seem to have been a good choice to score a sci-fi film like The Omega Man. The score is in no way dissonant, atonal or difficult, say, in the way much of twentieth century classical music can be, nor is it banal or bubblegum pop. It's full of big, memorable themes, particularly the big, mournful theme that first appears on track two and is listenable all the way through.  So what is it that some people don't like? The main complaint is about all the electronic and synthesized sounds that fill the score. It seems that many people wanted a strictly traditional orchestral score and nothing else. Yet Mr. Grainer's soundtrack was very much a product of it's time, a time of musical experimentation that included early attempts to use electronic effects in music. It was at this exact time that Isaac Hayes was writing his memorable score for Shaft with it's endless guitar effects and Henry Mancini experimented with synthesizers for his theme for the TV show Cade's County. So there are a lot of electronic effects in this score, usually accompanying the orchestra and sometimes alone for brief passages (which are admittedly unmelodic). But these effects often have a hollow sound which perfectly matches the eerie mood of the piece as well as the undead nature of the villains. The use of these effects, including a calliope at one point, are creative and well considered. I see nothing to complain about in Mr. Grainer's use of electronic effects and consider this a matter of individual taste.  There are other complaints. Some people don't like the occasional easy listening tracks that occur. But easy listening music was an indicator of Neville (the Charleton Heston Character), his taste, the kind of guy he was; it was what he listened to at home and thus it is included in the score, including the opening of the "Theme From a Summer Place". In a complete score you include these things. Some people find it to be too much of an action movie score. But The Omega Man is essentially an action film take on a science fiction theme, with its literate, vocal "vampires" and many shootouts and kidnappings it's neither horror nor straight drama. The dynamic passages fit their sequences. Some find the end music too happy but the film makers decided on a happy ending so what can you do? If you don't like these things don't get the score, but the elements that some criticize all have valid reasons to be there.  When I first saw the film in the Fall of 1971 I was really blown away by the music and was sorely disappointed to find out there was no soundtrack record. Until then I had thought that every film got a soundtrack record. Truly wanting it at any cost, I ended up at a drive-in theater on a bitterly cold December night where it was playing on a double bill with McCabe and Mrs. Miller and recorded passages from the drive-in speakers on my portable tapedeck. For years that was my only copy, complete with gunfire and bits of dialogue.  Then Filmscore Monthly, a magazine with a devoted base of ardent fans, licensed the rights to The Omega Man score so they could put out their usual edition of 3,000 copies, as they do for other neglected scores. It sold out so fast and there was so much more demand that they paid for thr rights to put out a larger, second edition. That's what this is, and that's what the 2.0 means. This is identical to the other one being offered. That's the original 3,000 pressing and thus is rarer and goes for a collector's price. But don't be confused, this is not additional music or music from a follow up film, just the second pressing.  If you like film scores and don't mind a few electronic effects, this is a real classic.
0	A friend introduced me to the music of Michael Franks. He is awesome and his music is so mellow!
0	Putting out a cd with a bunch of kids that can't sing or harmonize, with a bunch of lame singing adults is not a good Idea! This is another excuse to spend on this junk! The Sugar Beats is the Real Deal for any type of cover songs of hits! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!
0	Cero stars because i can't listening you charge to my credit card but never download.
0	The remake of the Sade hit is the only song I like. I believe Sade's song should be included in a more up-tempo Botti recording.
0	Awesome! Want to listen "Non-Stop!" Miranda is a genius.
1	I erroneously identified "So Nice" with "Desifinado".  This is the one.  Almost as good as the Getz version.  As I said on the other review, I like Bossa Nova.
1	This adding is Moving! !!! I often go to it when I need to feel Gods presence in my life.
1	did not buy this item.
1	Good song
0	great album
1	i did not buy this so not sure why i'm asked to rate it.. Can someone explain why i have to rate it as a purchase I made?
0	I don't expect Dream Theater to make another great album like WDADU, Images and Words, or Awake. But I do expect them to sound like a talented band with a great chemistry, energy, and creative edge. The Astonishing sounds like a bunch of burned out musicians laying down some tracks over a early 90's Boss drum machine...Maybe next time
1	I love head east 4 songs are great
1	This comes from one of the more obscure Gerge Harrison albums but will always be one of my favorite songs!
1	I love R. Kelly. This is one of my favorites of his and I just had to get it. I like it because of the easy beat and the dance moves associated with it. Good stuff.
1	About a buck forty into "Bubblegum", pure elation and total enlightment will enter your conscious. A more joyous passage is not to be found. It only lasts about 20 seconds, but nonetheless. You have been warned.
1	I just want to download the MP3 file to a directory I choose on my computer.  I don't want the Amazon downloader added to my computer. I don't want my music on the Cloud.  I just want to be able to do simple download of the MP3 files.  Now I don't have either of the MP3 files that I purchased and there are no options on any page including my account/digital purchases to redownload the purchases. I am really pissed off at this.  This system SUCKS!
1	Wonderful music, wonderful lyrics, wonderful vocals! I really like the praise and worship aspect of this album. I have used the music for my Church's worship service.
0	old school rap
0	I'm just asking because it's horrible.  Nevermind that the original was a work of genius or inspiration, this retread offers nothing new aside from some very grating electronica noise and padding.  This is a picture-perfect poster boy for why remixes are a much maligned musical medium; they are often terrible.  (Hope you enjoyed the alliteration!)
1	Great song!!!!
0	Didn't really know much about Doyle Lawson until I somehow stumbled upon this song.  The first time I heard it, I was hooked.  I've always loved Bluegrass.  Although I'm not a well versed expert on it, I know what I like.  I didn't realize until after I had listened to the song umpteen time that it was the Paul Simon song.  Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver have really done wonderful justice to it!  I dare you to NOT move when you listen to it.  It is physically impossible :)
0	Very low quality recordings! Be aware
0	This album is a cheap bootleg from Russia. The quality is bad and not comparable with the originals. You should download only legal material from CHILLY in perfect quality. Find all the legal albums here at AmazonJohnny Loves Jenny Special Edition Maxi Singles new mixSecret Lies 2014 (B.B.M. Remix)
0	It's a totally different version of the song than what was played in the mainstream media, which was the one I wanted. I found the one I wanted in their greatest hits.
1	Just plain awesome beats and prescient lyrics about how much control we have given to computers over our lives.  As a bonus, my kids get to see how bad I was as a break dancer some 30 years ago because I just have to show my barely present skills when Jam On It plays!
1	This Song is Incomplete, You can hear where they Clipped it at the end even.  You Have to get Stay for the Rest of It.
1	This song touches my heart everything I hear it! It touches me in such a way that I was led to minister the song through a dance
0	never ordered Christmas music
1	Deceptive junk. Someone's poorly rerecorded version of songs from the games.
1	This is a pirated edition. Both albums are readily available in legitimate releases, and those are the ones that should be bought.
1	I always enjoy Fiona's music and this piece was no different.  I love how her music can actually end up on different albums because it can be appropriate for so many occasions.  The title drew me to this song and I was not disappointed.  Very artistic and beautiful.
1	My latest song to wear out. Matchbox 20 has a home run with this one: fun, sassy and hilarious. Every time I hear this song I want to dance and wish I was the pain-in-the-ass that inspired it. LOVE IT!!!
1	Such a shame to ruin an original sound and come up with a " new coldplay " pop sound.... how come the artist let their reputation ruin like this and become pop stars without a soul but bad lyrics and all the same lame sound, listen coldplay first 2 albums and last to you will get what i mean, such a shame!!!
1	I'm sort of a comedy buff you might say. Honestly, I've had way more laughs reading these reviews than I've had listening to all of DeRosa's material. Now that I think about it, I don't think any of his jokes ever made me laugh...well maybe a couple tss tss's here and there. Double guns, bitches.
0	This is a stroll through the good old days that makes your heart either break or sing. Love the entire thing from start to finish.
0	This album is worth having for the first track, Thrash Wildfire, alone.  As implied it is a "thrash" version of the 1975 cheese song "Wildfire".  Several other songs (This is Not What I Paid For, Flommy the Robot, We Used Your Car) are fun as well, as long as you can get past the basement tape audio quality.  Track Listing:  # 01 Thrash Wildfire # 02 This is Not What I Paid For # 03 Fightin Myself # 04 Casper the Friendly Ghost # 05 I Like You Too Much # 06 Flommy the Robot # 07 My Downtown # 08 We Used Your Car # 09 You Got One Song # 10 Miss Perfect  Unfortunately it's long out of print....
1	oh no--terrible--where is the real bob Dylan?
1	Casting Crowns has always been my favorite for quite awhile now, and they did not disappoint me.  I would recommend this song to anyone!
1	What in the world did they do to ruin ELVIS'S voice, which sounded thin and distant and fake, while Barbra sounded luxurious and sang much more of the song with all this over-production and glissando stuff? To add insult to injury I read an interview with some guy whom I think co-produced the album and he specifically commented on how great Elvis sounded and it was just like Presley was in the studio with them. NOT!!!!!!! They RUINED Elvis's voice. Absolutely ruined it. It was not believable as a duet. That one song is all you need to know about how they produced this album. It was if they deliberately took the resonance out of the other singers' voices so Babs could shine.  It's also true Barbra doesn't venture out of her safety zone. Instead of being creative and bold and adventuresome, this was contrived, stilted, TOO MUCH BARBRA in relation to the other artists, none of whose voices sounded all that great. It reminded me of a star who has to upstage a colleague by getting in the way of their camera shot or stealing the spotlight. Come on Babs! Are you that insecure?  Whoever mixed and engineered this album concentrated so much on Streisand that the others suffered by comparison and it just did not sound natural.  That cover picture is also very strange. She looks like she's a female pastor of some Amish church or something in that outfit. There's nothing feminine about that suit. Wouldn't it have been better to put small pics of the other artists on the cover with BJS in the center? It's incongruous to just have her and then the word "Partners." WHAT partners? They're not visible on the front cover.  A big disappointment overall. I'd like to hear some truly fresh material. BTW, BJS has been very clever in prolonging her career all these years as a vocalist, since her range and power are gone and she is more whispery than ever. She used to be a belter. No more. Compare her earlier releases with this one and you can tell there has been a HUGE decline in the quality of her voice. It's sad but true.  Maybe an album of her lesser-known songs as a compilation would have been better, as she has had some cuts on prior releases that didn't receive the attention they deserved. That would have been better than this feeble attempt to "partner" with anybody. The only artist whom I've heard really pull this off is ANNE MURRAY, who even did a "duet" with Dusty Springfield. Anne's CD of a few years ago was splendidly done so it was really believable.
1	well where should i start..umm lil wayne is the most overRated rapper ever, and this album carter 3 proves my point, there is only like 3 maybe 4 good songs on here, and they are 1.you aint got nuthin on me 2. A Milli 3. lollipop...and well "dont get it" would have been a good one but he talks for about 7 min at the end of the song. i have no idea why people why people like him so much, like he may make a great song or two every 4 albums, and everybody wants to have all this fuss about him selling a million records in a week, plz it has been done before, it might be a big deal for lil wayne because hes been rapping since he was 14 and its a big deal for a bubble gum rapper(lil wayne)...plz come on people, lil wyane has been rapping since he was 14 damn he must be terrible, only one hit record which is also a peice of crap too....eminem hasn't been in the game that long but he has sold over 70 million records worldwide, lil wayne(which who has been around since he was 14)sold less than 10 million records worldwide...now whoes better!!....ohh by the wayne eminem sold 1.76 million for his second mayjor album in a week(the marshall mathers lp) and the eminem show sold over a mill in a week..lil wayne is a peice of crap compared to eminem...i respect lil wyane, nd do like some of his music, so thats why he does get at least two stars nd not one, i just wish people would stop going crazy over him and make hime biger than he really is...
1	i have no idea what this is i didn't order it
1	Just discovered this dude.  Playing the $&it out of this.
1	This is awful.  What happened to the Jewel sound I used to know and love.  I'm absolutely disgusted at this new album.  Blegh.  My loyalty has dropped 1000 points.
1	used this for my uncle's funeral and the download did the job it was used for.  Not much to say about a music mp3
1	It skipped too much. Even after i bought a new turntable. Look somewhere else.
0	This chick rocks ty!!!
1	It cuts out and skips and starts over. Bad download I guess. Disappointed cause I love the song. Fix it
1	great product @ super price
1	The highlights of this album are clear: Fade to Black + For Whom the Bell tolls.  The rest of this is just plain boring. Unfortunately, this is one of the more overrated bands of all time, but kids just can't see that  becuaes there are so few other bands worth listening to.  Save your money  or go buy some old Judas Priest - it's better than this noise.
1	I love this song as sung by John Denver and thought that was what I was downloading, however it was a duet song by John Denver and someone else which is not what I wanted.  There was no mention of that on the page a purchased it on!
1	I'm just gonna go right out and say it... Miley needs to stop. She's making a fool of herself every day now. She wants to sever ties from Disney, that's fine, but, Growing Up: You're doing it wrong. In a topic not related to Miley, I'm not a fan of this stop-start rapping technique that a lot of people like to use. To me, it's like playing with the pedals in a car, where you punch the gas then slam the brakes. Punch, slam, punch, slam, punch, slam...you get the idea. Like as if I were in a car, similarly, this technique makes me nautious and irritable. However, this is FAR from the worst steaming bag of fermented crap I've ever heard. That title goes to Lil' Wayne's "Mrs. Officer". Talk about blow-your-brains-out annoying.
1	This is one of the most memorable bass lines in pop music, you can lay anything on top of it and it will sound hip.
1	Another of my old favorites.
1	I love this song, I bought the MP3 after hearing Gavin perform it live in Texas. It's very catchy and a little rocky, a little poppy. It's hard to review music as it's based on personal preference, but I like this song. It also makes great music for a dinner party in the background.
1	I love cam.  By 16 I was a Christian.  But it wasn't until I got to my last year in college that I started getting into cam.  Oh yeah, that's right,  DC Christian (or Talk) scored a hit with "Jesus Freak,"  I first heard that song during my freshman year.  Loved it.  That song showed me how to loosen up a bit while a christian attending college.  I still needed more hints than that though.  I guess it's how I appreciated Jars of Clay, my favorite cam group, and Newsboys.   The frontman sings in high notes in "Believe."  I thought it interesting they hail from Australia.
1	I prefer a much deeper voice playing or singing impossible dream like the play
1	I love both artist but they just threw this so called album together... It sounds rushed!!!
0	The epitome of meh. An album that makes you question if Mumford and Sons ever really had any special skills in writing music. With this album, you get generic, uninspired rock songs about relationships. Marcus Mumford just doesn't have the voice to sell me on a passionate track about love. He was more use when he was writing grittier lyrics in Sigh No More that actually suited his vocals. Mumford and Sons try stepping in a world where they just artistically can't compete with the other artists.
1	Hands down one of Biggies best album. His style and rawness is displayed through his creative story telling from the intro to the very end. He's delivery and epic tone of his voice will always be remembered as one of the legends in hip hop history.
1	Love The Hollies old music!
1	Ole School song, but still great to listen to daily
1	I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in... pop and light jazz, but acquiesced to a harder-edged album all the same.  An artist is going to follow her own path, obviously, but I wish Tane-san would've done an album or two more of straight-ahead rock, because she's good at it and her voice is well suited for it.  The "Hetero" album is something that fans of rock and female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity, because although it has some minor downsides, it's akin to a buried pop-rock treasure.  Since there's no track listing here I'll do a blow-by-blow:  1. "Kaeshite" ("Give It Back") starts with a strange, almost playful verse, takes some wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression, picks up a stark, thin drumbeat, then dives into an excellent, somewhat angsty chorus which, again, traverses a chord progression unlike anything I've heard before.  Just a great, understated rock tune.  2. "Down" is far more poppy, but with the same arresting vocal attitude.  The groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard, but here's where Tane's unique voice shines through.  It's difficult for me to explain exactly why, but her voice reminds me of Phoebe Snow.  Maybe its because of that strange vibrato, which sounds both tightly-controlled and loose at the same time, but that comparison keeps jumping out at me, even years after I first heard this disc.  3. "Cut the Fruits" is a little funky, a little jazzy, with beautiful, floating, upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses. There's a satisfying gnarly-twangy guitar break in the bridge, then back to that glide-groove, then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end.  Just an excellent groove from start to finish.  4. "Ame to Gamu" ("Chewing Gum Candy") is hard to describe.  Again it's vocal over acoustic guitar (something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me,) but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding.  There is a lot of really weird instrumentation (synth washes, and... French accordion?) but it all meshes perfectly.  The bridge is a bass solo, something that seems to send American producers running like frightened rabbits. If you've spent much time listening to Japanese rock and pop, one of the first happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous "dum-dum-dum-dum-dum" drone buried deep in the background, but rather is an integral, catalyzing element of the mix.  How or why Japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists on Earth (Masaki of Daida Laida and Liv Moon, Koga Michiko of Doll$Boxx and Gacharic Spin, King-san [formerly] of ShakaLabbits, Onda Yoshihito of Zamza and Judy And Mary, Hibiki of Light Bringer, etc.,) is beyond me.  Ditto how or why Japan has an abundance of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal.  But I am really, really glad that's the case.  Anyhow, "Ame to Gamu" is an unforgettable song, and Tane's vocal performance is just phenomenal here.  And I almost forgot:  Something that puts a big, goofy smile on my face every time I listen to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are a quote of that three-chord figure in Jimi's "Wind Cries Mary."  Whether that's incidental or intentional, it... just makes me smile.  5. "Memoria" is maybe the best song on this album, but undercut by an annoyance in the recording:  The heavier parts are noticeably distorted.  You have to push that annoyance aside, because "Memoria" is just epic - one of those songs that's like a heartfelt little journey or adventure.  It begins soft as a feather, builds and builds, explodes in anthemic choruses, then after a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into an unexpected, melodically-magical passage that builds to its own crescendo - with Tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal - to end on that same soft-as-a-feather place it started.  This is one of those tunes you can listen to for the first time today, yet will seem like it was the backdrop for some of the most moving experiences of your life, a song that's been with you for years.  That, folks, is powerful songwriting.  Just a great song - easily one of my all-time faves.  It's unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the choruses, but... great song.  6. "No Joker" starts with Tane's sly vocal over piano and drums that sound a little like solo John Lennon - but this is the tune I like least on the album, mostly because of the choruses, which have Tane stretching her range too much, amid repeats of the line "I wanna be your woman / I wanna be your woman."  It's not a horrid song, but to me the choruses are awkward and a little annoying, and the bridge is just weird, and not in a good way.  7. "Kakekko" ("Sprint" or "Race") is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb-ambience, evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst.  There's also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge.  8. "Kage no Naka no Kage" ("Shadow in the Middle of a Shadow") is the most jazzy tune on the disc - more in line with the stuff she's done since - but an excellent, relaxed groove.  9. "Daite te Hoshii" ("I Want You to Hold Me") is another jazzy tune, mellower than "Kage," with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses, then the same over a drumbeat, with some funk-flavored instrumentation with the choruses.  The vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of the songs, which leads me to believe it's one of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality (just a guess, since my Nihongo skills are only a little bit beyond The Three Most Important Phrases In Any Language, namely, "Where is the beer?" "Where is the restroom?" and "I love you," generally in that order - and I haven't sat down to translate it.)  10. "Tree" closes out the album in a dreamy, atmospheric wash, with Tane's voice processed through a thin "radio mic" patch that fits the song perfectly.  There are two breaks into slower-tempo grooves that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song.  An understated but relentlessly cool tune.  I'm far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop, so although there are a lot of her tunes I like from later albums, "Hetero" is her standout disc - for that rock element.  But again, I still haven't gotten around to getting her other '90s discs.  If you like alt-rock that's generally upbeat rather than a massive boat-anchor of metaphysical angst, and if you enjoy totally unique voices, get "Hetero."  Definitely time well spent.

0	He doesn't even rap 90% of the time.  You are listening to weird sounds that stoners will think sound cool.
1	Seems kind of obvious, eh? Maybe not. Paul Hindemith did live in the US for a while. Wish I had paid more attention to my high school German.

0	Not for everyone. Children of the 70s understand.
0	Might drive U nuts at the 100th time u listen to it, but still a great song!
1	Great album I give it 4.5 stars out of five. I really like this album theres songs that are all screaming and some with emotional catchy cleans. My favorite tracks on this album are Wounds and Carry the Weight the lyrics in those songs really speak to me and with buddy's emotion put into the songs you really feel what he has been through. Overall senses fail have really matured in this album if your a fan of their past work give this album a listen you won't be disappointed.
0	It is music not Viagra tablet I was kind of spoof
0	Her voice is as beautiful as ever,
1	I have always been a John Wiliams fan. He has written amazing music and Harry Potter and the prisioner of Azkaban is no exception. He has created a whole new atmosphere an makes the environment darker than in the other films. He has added not commonly used instruments, like the recorder,  and has made this music magical.
1	This is a "T.rex Tribute Band" Not T.rex. After making my purchase i learned that in 1997 former T.rex band member Mickey Finn put this band together as "Mickey Finn's T-rex". After Mickey Finn's death in 2003 the band changed their name to "T-rex (a celebration of marc and mickey)" and that is when this was released, but amazon has it listed [as MP3] under "T-rex" dropping the "(a celebration of marc and mickey)" and selling me MP3s of T.rex that are not T.rex at all, just a tribute band.  In July 2008, after some British fans made a petition for them to stop using this name, the band decided to revert their name back to Mickey Finn's T-Rex, with the blessing from Mickey's family for using his name. The only member now in the group that had any connection to T.Rex is drummer Paul Fenton. Some die-hard T.Rex fans believe that they should not have used the name T-Rex (despite the addition of 'a celebration of Marc and Mickey' to the name) which the band legally owns. So beware of what you are really buying, and do your research.  Also beware of the "classic hits" MP3 offered as well. It too is recorded by this tribute/celebration of/RIP OFF  In some people's opinion these are better versions of the originals. I myself prefer the originals. Amazon has a very limited selection of actual T.rex MP3s, the only full length studio album they offer is Electric Warrior, and the soundtrack to the Born to Boogie film directed by Ringo Starr. I wouldn't have such a bad taste in my mouth if amazon offered all his full length albums as MP3s. Because when i type in a song title along with T rex, it gives me this bogus tribute band as the official T.rex, with no alternative choices.  Since writing this i have noticed the official T.rex selections use a period after the T. and the tribute use a hyphen after the T-, and in the artwork uses a lightning bolt as a hyphen.  So if you only want official T.rex search under "T.rex"

0	I have been listening to Nirvana since 92, collecting every thing I could, both official on non-official. My mouth was watering over this release since I now only buy vinyl records...but then I listened to it.  My main problem is with LP 1 (Nevermind Remastered) - This is the worst of it. Compared to my 2009 pressing, the cymbals have been nearly stripped of their presence. The beauty of Dave's crashing has been flattened down. It all sounds more like a badly mixed CD than a high quality vinyl. I thought my ears were playing tricks on me so pulled the remaster off my turntable and threw on my 2009 copy. While the new one made my ears ache, the original drew me right through to the end of a side, like it always does. The new version is devoid of any depth and there are obvious clipping issues. I'm afraid to turn this thing up for fear of that awful overdriven distortion creeping in. Kurt's vocals on parts of Lithium sound especially bad, artificially distorting. I didn't believe it on the first listen, but after comparing to the original there is no mistaking it. I'm am no expert but this does not sound like it is even analog sourced. The 2009 vinyl edition was remastered from the original analog master tapes. Buy that one while you still can.  Aside from this, the track listing shows UME has no idea what a person listening to vinyl records wants. Boombox demos are unnecessary on a audiophile medium, but they took it further and split them across 2 records. Logic would tell you they could have been on one separate LP so you could listen to it once and put it aside, but hey, what do I know? Keep in mind that as someone who owned all the Outcesticide CDs I do appreciate this, the problem is just with the execution. The demos really should have been a bonus download.  For the other material, I'm willing to settle since it's the only way you are going to get this rare material on vinyl. The highlight is actually the last side of the last record. Early versions of Drain You, Something in the Way (loud as hell, in a good way) and the standard Endless Nameless.  All in all, this could have been so much better.
0	I was introduced to the group watching Graham Norton, and was blown away buy their music.  This is their new album, and I think it's wonderful.  Now I have to buy their other ones!
1	Okay, I've read all these reviews that say "artists have to be allowed to evolve," etc, and I agree with that to a certain extent. Yes, I actually read those reviews before I wrote this one. You have to know who you're dealing with beforehand.  Alright, so you want my honest opinion? After knowing Jewel through her Pieces of You and Spirit years, I really loved her honest and heartfelt acoustic music. She seemed like a true singer-songwriter who put her heart and soul into her lyrics and her guitar playing. I was really looking forward to more of her after "Foolish Games," "You Were Meant For Me," and "Hands," 3 of my all-time favorite songs. I really felt connected to her after those songs.  Okay, so then I hear she has a new album and I immediately listen to it. But it's not the same person. Yes, I'm all for evolution and change, but NOT something so drastic. Even her style of dress turned into one of those risque, club hopping Britney's or Paris Hilton's. That was not even CLOSE to the Jewel I thought I knew. And the beautiful acoustic playing? It's replaced with dance beats and brainless lyrics about selling yourself to your "intuition"....oh, please. Who the hell propositioned her with all this dough to totally demoralize her trueness to herself? Where did Jewel's essence and talent go, leaving this tabloid-seeking, hollow shell of a songwriter? I'm depressed with this transformation. It doesn't leave anything for honest-to-god acoustic music lovers to taste. I like evolution, but not when it leaves merely a shell of a songstress.  So, Jewel, I hope with this new album you're promising that you bring yourself back to your roots. Because you left your heart in those roots and I miss that passionate, beautiful, and truthful guitar playing and acoustically brilliant lyrics. Come back, Jewel.
0	Good music
1	This is such a soothing CD.  Love all the songs, some may sound a bit schmaltzy, but I love all the well crafted songs, especially on a lazy Sunday afternoon, spent just chillin"
1	relaxing.great background music for working or studying.
1	I had heard this song when I was a kid and always liked it, but never knew who had performed it.  I also never heard the words clearly enough as a kid to remember them.  Then, the evening I bought this track on Amazon, I had heard it playing in a clothing store and picked up the lyric "As he rises to her apology".  That was enough to look up the line, find the song, and confirm I had the right one. :)  Now a permanent part of my collection.  This song has surprisingly deep lyrics that tell a rather profound story.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
1	this is a song I remember from a movie but I think now listening I know why this was a one hit wonder
0	Great Album!
1	Thank you.
1	It down loaded as an html file which does me absolutely no good whatsoever and can't figure out how to return it.
1	This is a very unique CD, Never heard Katy Perry like this!  My daughter loved it, it was a Christmas gift for her.
0	I want all of you so blinded by your own ignorance to throw this album AWAY.  Cast it off of a casm, destroy it as quickly as you can...because this type of music epitomizes what is so wrong and souless with modern music, movies, and popular culture.  This is yet another band that has been manufactured (i'm aware they were some sort of "real" rock band prior to getting a record deal, but that's beside the point) by a label into churning out totally insipid, formulaic and safe music that the clueless masses will eat right up.  All that said, they clearly have little if any talent.  So, to FREE yourself from years potentially wasted listening to "music" such as this (Simple Plan, Linkin Park, Good Charlotte, etc), download or buy yourself some music with real feeling, creativity, originality and lasting power:  Radiohead, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground, Bob Marley, Neil Young, Curtis Mayfield, The Doors, Herbie Hancock, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, My Bloody Valentine, Ravi Shankar...  These artists and many others are the TRUE luminaries.  Yes, music taste is objective...but just try any of these artists and stop being confined to single genres and unchallenging bands.  PLEASE...it's for your and everyone else's own good.
1	Its really hard to find kid's music that does not have the over abused choir voices belting out the tunes. I don't know anyone who enjoys hearing choirs all.the.time. And its not like the songs NEED a choir. Someone got it in his.her head that children will respond to a bunch of kids singing vs one talented adult or one talented singer.  PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD, STOP using choirs for kids songs!! Too much of anything is bad. It gets to the point where all the songs sound the same & good luck having a toddler keep up with the words unless they already know the song.. Choir music makes it really hard to break up the words so that kids can sing along.  For people sick of the "same old" nursery music CD's, I recommend:  Beatrix Potter Nursery Rhyme Book and CD I bought it for the music but the book is great, too. The people who made this CD, knew what they where doing! Its a musical trip into Beatrix's world. Wonderful singers (different age ranges and sex) bring each nursery rhyme to life. I can't get enough of it.
1	The sounds are clear and a wide range. I don't like how many screaming cats there are. I have cats and don't want to hear that!
1	This song really moved me and gave me hope that He is doing a work in me.  For those of us that have had some hard times- it is encouraging
1	Great love song too slow dance with the one you love.  Would be a great song for a first dance for a wedding
0	Awesome song,  I absolutely love it.
1	Although there are Move albums that have a more consistent set of well written tunes, if you're a fan of the band you know to expect "quirky" around every corner. My original US release and the CD I got later were pretty murky from a mastering standpoint. Thanks to Amazon Unlimited, I now have the digital download and it is amazing. If you love the Move and subsequent early ELO releases, this version of Message belongs in your library. On another note, the touring version of ELO, the orchestra, puts on one of the finest live shows that I have ever experienced. They do very few shows here in the US, but if they are anywhere near you, catch their act.
1	If you like the sound of rain and distant thunder while you sleep, this is the perfect recording. Good quality!
1	Love it
1	There were a few good tunes but that was it.  I ended up giving this away to a teenager I know.
1	It was not the same as the album I have of my father's.  It's a huge disappointment.  I haven't even opened it or listened to it.  I would return it if I could or exchange it.
1	Great album as usual from Emmylou. But to hear Rodney Crowell again after so long was a pleasure. His voice sounds great. It was a great idea to pair them together. The album is almost perfect.
1	I love this! It makea my heart happy!
1	Oh man!  I just grabbed this with my free Prime streaming.  What a great album!  If you like Cage the Elephant, Royal Blood, etc, you will love these guys!
0	Very disapointed with this selection. Bought this from recomendation others bought after buying  lake street dive "bad self portraits". Not even close ,  sounds like 2 peice band ,not full,rich or deep at all. one time listen.
1	I admit that so far, I've only had time to listen to the first 21 tracks.  But all are exceptional works, performed exceptionally.  I'm grateful to Amazon for making this available for only $2.99.  One thing that would have made this collection even better would have been to include the Vaughan Williams Piano Concerto.  But I already have a couple of recordings of that, so it's no big deal for me.  If you'd like a cheap copy of that (and you probably do, if you're looking at this collection), you can find it here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0092ES2PU/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_1.
0	An upbeat, catchy melody with equally upbeat lyrics - I've listened to it mostly nonstop for the last two days and I'm still not sick of it!  The song stands on its own as an awesome tune, so you don't need to have seen the movie to appreciate either the music or the lyrics (although the film was very cute).  It's definitely one of Owl City's best works to date!
0	Killer Klowns from Outer Space is one of my favorite movies, and finally picked up the title song from it. Great buy at 99 cents.
1	One of the best songs ever. The video is just as beautiful
0	Love this music
0	Not my type of music and have no idea how I got it.  Not in my library or on my cloud.
1	Great blues album, give it a listen.
0	I have downloaded other Mancini songs (Pink Panther, Baby Elephant Walk), and the quality of those recordings is wonderful. This recording, however, sounds more like a high-school band recorded on a cassette recorder. Subtle "bum" notes (especially in the opening trumpet theme- maybe the French horns?), lots of hiss in the background, thin bass and drum sounds... This recording is very unlike the professional work I was expecting. I hope another, better made, version shows up someday.
0	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend because she absolutely loves twenty-one pilots and she loves the CD! It reminds Us of older Muse!
0	Been in love with the South African guitarist forever...Now, his foray into gospel has me spellbound!  A beautiful collection for music lovers!
1	SERIOUSLY? I am sure no one at Amazon bothered to listen to this first. I was like, hey cool, new holiday music. I am glad I previewed this song before I played it in front of my 3 and 5 year old kids, or even yet my grandmother!  DON'T GET THIS SONG IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO ADD TO YOUR HOLIDAY PLAYLIST IF YOU DON'T WANT TO OFFEND ANYONE!
0	Masur isn't especially renowned for his Bruckner and his later recordings in New York have been less than kindly received in some quarters. I also tend to think of him as a speed-merchant; sometimes, as in his Brahms Requiem his urgency pays off but at on other occasions he can come across as simply perfunctory.  That is certainly not the case here, even though he is typically propulsive; in fact his speeds are almost identical to those of Karajan. However, the older I get and the more I listen, the more I am convinced that the stopwatch is no guide to the effectiveness of performance; of course it's all about the proportions of and relationships between sections, the phrasing, and the skill with which a conductor applies discreet changes of tempo, his use of rubato, rallentando and accelerando. OK; I waffle - but you get the drift of my truism.  Then, of course, there is the question of spirit, that indefinable "special something" which animates a reading. You feel from the first horn call that you are in safe hands with Masur, just as with Karajan you know that in charge is someone who knows what he wants and why. It also helps to have that conductor directing one of the most illustrious German orchestras. Masur's tenure as Kapellmeister with the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig endured 26 years; here he was already five years into that partnership and their rapport shows. I certainly don't hear a lack of originality or an avoidance of excitement - but I do hear Bruckner beautifully played. The horn apotheosis if the hunters' march (so reminiscent of Mahler) in the Andante is just swell and the Scherzo has glorious horns. The sense of mysterious, menacing purpose to the opening of the Finale building to the grandiose statement of defiance by the brass is perfect and Masur sustains tension throughout.  With my usual attachment to parsimony, I bought the old RCA Navigator issue on Marketplace for pennies (just in case it was a duff purchase). How wrong I was to fear; now I could always upgrade to the later re-mastering, although the sound is in fact fine - just a tad hissy and papery.
1	I love the 60s and 70s music available but I can't download it into my iTunes library no matter how many times I try.  I even went to the help page and followed the recommendations but without luck.  I'd purchase more from Amazon, but not as long as I can only listen to it in the Cloud.
1	The sound is bad on this one.  It is low, you cannot turn it up loud.
1	he was one of the greats
1	I can always find the old school music I like and I love the fact you can be them in single instead if the whole album.
1	Is it wrong to be 60 yrs. old & love this song? LOL. I swear this song makes me want to get up & dance! It has no vulgar words in it & yet it's very popular. I call it a feel good song. I can see this song & the dance replacing some of the old favorites at weddings too.
1	Like the title says, Kansas still pulls it off musically. Unfortunately the video is so blurry whenever someone on stage or the camera moves, it is rendered unwatchable. I could barely make it through the first three songs before I gave up trying to watch and just listened as I moved about the house. Tried this DVD on several players and my computer, all with the same results. Perhaps mine is defective? Is it worth the hassle to try to return to Amazon? Probably not. Live and learn.
1	Doesn't sound like original.
1	This is a great song. It is uplifting and encouraging. It is also very up beat and fast paced. I listen to it all the time.
1	Great CD.Fast service. Good songs.
0	so much love !
1	Great song/ bad can't add this to my jukebox list, cd is copy locked. I wanted to add it two my mp3 player, but no I can't other then take great cd, don't buy is you want to make mp3 and play it from the computer.
1	Lovely Song!
0	the song "amazing" truly lifts my spirits and makes me feel so whole inside. her voice is truly amazing as well!
1	Awesome
1	Classic Cat Stevens.  Wild World belongs in any collection of folk rock music.  The song is from his most prolific period off of the Tea for Tillman album.  The song is about his relationship with an American woman.  A must have for the genre.
1	Sergio Bruni is,arguably, Naples' greatest singer (after Caruso).  Imagine my disappointment when I received this disc to find that half of it is filled with pop music completely unrelated to Bruni.  I called the producer in Naples and learned that this disc is produced under license by Amazon so somebody clearly screwed up.  There was no way to communicate this to Amazon and found the identical mistake on a replacement disc so I asked for and received a refund.  I would bet that the mistake has not been fixed.  So beware!  If you want italian music, stick to imports rather than reproductions made under license.
0	A Clash of 2 different worlds is amazing and definately works for me! These lyrics are awesome, as is Nate and Eminem!
0	Wonderful, straight forward accompaniment, but a little fast and long pauses between each verse.
1	Always good, Van Halen never go wrong
1	Heard this song on my birthday and couldn't get it out of my head, had to have it. Wale is amazing love him
1	Absolute classic!
0	Depeche Mode still has it!  A catchy song that is painfully good.  Poignant and relevant.  Love the lyrics and the melody.  If you are a die hard Depeche Mode fan, you can't go wrong with this one.
1	Love Adeles new CD was not a fan of her last one
1	This song got me through labor and delivery :)
0	Unfortunately it is still very relevant today.
1	Mississippi Queen is a great choice for a 70s sound with a strong lead guitar. I can't believe it took me this many years to get a copy of it.
1	this is a good sounding album....I really enjoy it ....I expect the talented people on here are happy to be among such a good group . Good luck to them all !
1	Freaking great.
1	Was searching for Tim Curry, as I love his version of the song, and so when looking in the Tim Curry results I saw the song and did a quick purchase not realizing this was NOT him but some cover band (they must have been big with some many other songs under their name, but when you Google them I find nothing about them).  I am truly sorry it does not have the same sound as Curry and am very disappointed.  Since cant refund digital purchases I am stuck just deleting and throwing my money away.  So annoyed that that I did not see it was not the artist I searched for but that Amazon had put some other artist in in the results for Tim Curry.
1	one of the great songs just one of the greats that Kenny sings. What can I say the man is awsome .
0	The add indicated that the seller was selling a CD and I got a cassette tape, I was sooooo disappointed. But I learned that; even if it is written it does not have to prove to be true.  However, that's all right!!!!!!!!!!! I was had.......
1	Hearing Is Believing must be one of the best "demonstration" albums of all time! True, there were many demonstration LPs to introduce stereophonic sound back in the day, but this record came earlier to sell people on what RCA Victor called its "new orthophonic" sound of "high fidelity." High fidelity was a huge improvement in recorded sound especially over those early acoustic 78rpm records that were made before music and speech could be recorded using electricity and a microphone; acoustic recordings sound like someone was singing "behind a door" as we hear the narrator say on this album.  Of course, this record was released by RCA Victor with yet another agenda--to sell high fidelity records to people so that they would run out and get the new RCA Victrola high fidelity phonographs (yes, they were called Victrolas) to play these new high fidelity 12 inch, 33 1/3 rpm records.  The first side of the album compares and contrasts what are mostly (if not all) acoustic recordings from the 1920s or even earlier with what was then the much more recent high fidelity recordings of primarily the same music and singing. Wow, how that must have amazed people--I would have marveled at the vast improvement in sound quality. The second side of the record album gives listeners nothing but the high fidelity sound of several tracks that still sound great today on my modern turntable!  Here is the track list for you:  Side 1: (comparisons between older recordings and high fidelity)  Gershwin: Rhapsody in Blue (Excerpts) old recording with Paul Whiteman's Orchestra and George Gershwin on piano compared with the "new orthophonic" high fidelity recording of the same piece with Hugo Winterhalter's Orchestra and Byron Janis, pianist  Moussorgsky: Pictures at an Exhibition: The Great Gate at Kiev old recording (Excerpt) Boston Symphony Orchestra with Serge Koussevitzky, Conductor compared with the "new orthophonic" high fidelity recording of this by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra  Leoncavallo: I Pagliacci: Prologue (Excerpts) old recording by Lawrence Tibbett with orchestra as compared to the "new orthophonic" high fidelity recording by Leonard Warren with Orchestra  Wagner: Lohengrin: Prelude to Act III old recording (Excerpt) Boston Symphony Orchestra, Karl Muck, Conductor as compared to "new orthophonic" Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra  Mozart: Symphony No. 39 in E-Flat: Fourth Movement (Excerpt) old recording Arturo Toscanini and the La Scala Orchestra, Milan compared to Schubert: Symphony No. 9 in C: Fourth Movement (Excerpt) "new orthophonic" high fidelity recording by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra  Side 2:  (all in high fidelity)  Offenbach: Gat Parisienne: Overture, Boston Pops orchestra, Arthur Fiedler, Conductor  Richard Strauss: Dance of the Seven Veils (Salom) (Excerpt) Chicago Symphony orchestra, Fritz Reiner, Conductor  Johann Strauss, Jr.: Freikugeln Polka, Boston Pops Orchestra, Fritz Reiner, Conductor  Rimsky-Korsakoff: Russian Easter Orchestra (Excerpt) Leopold Stokowski and his Symphony Orchestra  Robert Russell Bennett: Waltz of the Vinylite Biscuits Mr. Bennett conducting members of the NBC Symphony Orchestra  My Impossible Love: Henri Ren and his Orchestra  Eddie and the Witch Doctor: The Sauter-Finegan Orchestra  Melancholy Serenade: Hugo Winterhalter and his Orchestra  By the Sleepy Lagoon: The Melachrino Orchestra  Overall, if you still have a turntable and a keen interest in the history of recorded music, this is an album you must own. I highly recommend it.
1	Everybody needs a little Johnny fix from time to time
1	Head banging horrid !  I thought I would find something spiritual and uplifting.....Guess I am too old, but I only found what sounded like heavy metal and lyrics I could not begin to make out.  No musicality involved.  Would never recommend this.
0	Perfect Christmas song to add to your collection
0	Gotta say omarion isn't underated folks album is subpar and honestly Joe's bridges is miles better than this lp and yeah theres better baby making muzak than this. It's amazing how many people believe this album is spectacular sorry but this is a dud
0	I absolutely love this movie and the soundtrack. I listen to it all of the time so it was definitely a good life choice :) It arrived on time and in perfect condition: no scratches/skipping, etc
1	He's sings about the  love he has for Jesus! I have always loved his m music. I love this CD!
0	Awesome track! -AV Rodriguez 9/14/2017
0	Ok
1	Just what I wanted!!!
1	I have been a Rick Springfield fan since I was 12.  It's hard not to love anything he does.  This CD rocks the whole way through.
1	I love miley. despite her way of doing things. I think she has a beautiful voice. I knew that when she was hanna montana
0	This CD was very disappointing and the worst Brian Culbertson product of my collection. The vocals are sub-par and boring.
1	I was excited to hear this group, but when I received it, I instantly opened it and attempted to play it. It just skips. It's the first item I've been burned on using Amazon. What little I could hear, I didn't like. Someone will have to convince me otherwise.
0	i really enjoy this song, i haven't seen the movie yet but i'm sure it'll be very fitting. RIP paul
1	Another solid release. Nothing face melting, but they always release consistent, catchy, and groovy material.
0	Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.
1	I bought this because I liked one of the songs I heard on the radio.  Unfortunately it is the only song on the CD I actually like.  I wouldn't say the others are bad, just mediocre.
0	Now I nver like Jewel I'll say that right now, and I never liked Britney either. I will admitt Jewel has a sweet voice but this pathetic attempt to be a new Britney spears is rediculous. I loved INTUTION when it came out I couldn't believe it was Jewel...I thought Britney learned to sing...Then I saw the video and it was so sad to see a folk rocker trying to be a popstar. Jewel can't dance and she just dosen't have the pop look. Even in the music you can tyell this the beats and lyrics are so sad some don't even make sense. If you want a better jewel alum get the one with HANDS if you want a dance pop album go for britney or Paula Abdul. Dont waste your money. 1. Stand(10/10) 2. Run 2 U (1/10) 3. Intuition (9/10) 4.

0	Definitely one to own by the Great Jimmy Buffett.
1	After listening to the previews on Amazon I decided to buy the actual CD. I've always liked DJ Shadow, and was interested to hear what kind of beats he was making now (in 2016).  It is typical Shadow ambiances and found sounds, but some tracks have wildly swung broken beat patterns like Flying Lotus and the like. A few tracks attempt a dubstep feel, but it comes across as plodding. A couple selections even have some trap high hat patterns and tripleted patterns. Those actually sound the coolest.  The part that makes me absolutely dislike the album (even though parts are OK) is the rapper in the "rap" track that states that Trump has sex with his youngest daughter.... so Eff that rapper.  I would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wanna lose half of your audience. Moby just did the same, I'm selling all his CD's now as he mouthed off too about Trump.
1	My fav version of this often covered song
1	I love you blink 182 never stop rocking, amazon doesn't have a bad mp3 player system either. buy more blink
0	Great song by a great duo.
1	This song well makes me SMILE! This is a really, really great song! I used for a youth slideshow at church. The video is great as well.
0	Very hard to listen to
0	Received wrong record
1	I didn't buy this!  I don't even know what it is for pete's sake!!!  LIam what?  <sigh>  This is ridiculous!
1	I never heard this song/album and don't want to!!!I don't know where this song came from; I never ordered it!!!
1	This is the country version, I guess.  It's not like the version I've heard on Music Choice.  FGL just ripped me off.  They should let me trade it in for the correct version.
0	I bought this cd primarily to round out my Oz pub rock collection - I'd enjoyed a number of Screaming Jets singles over the years but never enough to buy an album. I took a punt on this greatest hits collection and was disappointed. There are at most half a dozen good rock songs, such as Better, Helping Hand, Shivers, October Grey and Eve of Destruction, and maybe one or two others. The rest are bland and indistinguishable from each other. If they'd left out the "pieces" and cut it down to the best 10 or so songs I'd probably have given it 3.5 stars and recommended it to anyone who has enjoyed any of the above mentioned songs. However with the gems scattered through the dross, this cd rarely makes it into my stereo, so it is for hard-core fans only - who probably already have all the songs anyway. If you're looking for some awesome Oz pub rock, check out Hunters & Collectors' Under One Roof, a live recording from their final tour. Brilliant.
1	Only got this for a friend.
0	I ordered this for my dad and he loved it!!
0	Best summer anthem since DJ jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince did Summertime nearly a quarter century ago.
1	This recording is NOT the recording from which Kix enjoyed uber play time during the hair days. I'd go so far to sayNot the version is just OK. I'm on the hunt for the "real" version of this tune. Disappointing and distracting to my ear, so I'm off to find the other. You've been warned. :-/  \m/
0	Foreword: I love Billy Joel's music and I'm looking forward to seeing him again in my country for a concert (possibly with his pal Elton John).  That said, if you're a fan you already own all of these (fine) songs (possibly more than once, if you've got the LIVE albums too); if you're new to Billy Joel then in my humble opinion you should get "Greatest Hits 1&2" (which, by the way, it's how I discovered Billy almost 25 years ago) and throw in "Greatest Hits 3" too: those 3 discs will give you an adequate idea of who we are talking about.  Since I don't think Billy is facing money problems (although I may as well be wrong, for I'm not really interested in gossip), I guess this is yet another case of a music company "milking the cash-cow"......  Ok, if you need EVERY SINGLE item BJ put on the market (good luck finding the original "Attila" on vinyl, BTW) then you've gotta have it. Otherwise, I think you'll be better off skipping this disc.
1	We love this song:) It is uplifting and help encourage me get through the day! our family highly recommends it!
1	Of course this will be good. really, what's not to love about Mumford & Sons. Love this follow up album.
1	Some lovely music but the samples are incorrectly labeled. Sample 1 is actually Danse Macabre by Camille Saint-Saens, Sample 2 is Funeral March For a Marionette by Charles Gounod, Sample 3 is Night On Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky, Sample 4 is March to the Scaffold from Symphonie Fantastique by Hector Berlioz, Sample 5 is In the Hall of the Mountain King from Peer Gynt by Edvard Grieg, Sample 6 is The Mephisto Waltz No. 1 by Franz Liszt, Sample 7 is The Sorcerers Apprentice by Paul Dukas. Sample 8 is The Dream Of A Witches Sabbath from Symphonie Fantasique by Hector Berlioz. There is no sample for the Toccata and Fugue, for organ in D minor by Johann Sebastian Bach.
1	perfect amount of sound, relaxing background touch for reading etc.
1	Draggy and boring... and the cover photo is unnecessary, unless it's to help sell a draggy and boring recording...
0	radioactive is the only song on here that really stands out, that being said the rest of the cd is worth listening to.
1	I've always loved Prince music and I had to get it. RIP Mr. Prince!
1	Wonderful CD.  I loved it.
1	Lucinda Williams has lead a hard life,at least as reflected in her music. West is a mature reflection of her experiences. She continues to lay it on the line without sugarcoating life. And the music isn't half bad either.
1	Very good song......I like to just put it on repeat and listen to it all night long......puts me in a good mood
1	Good
1	Ripped off by amazon again because you only hear tiny piece of intro which sounded promising but actually sucked.
0	this is the worst thing I've ever heard  :(  so bad it made me cry  good thing I put on some strapping young lad after this  so I quickly forgot about that terrible listening experience! DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM  BUY SOME STRAPPING YOUNG LAD INSTEAD!
1	Loved it
1	This album is incredible; it's my new favorite!!
1	When I first heard this song, I was like, Wow! Her vocals were good, and then by the bridge, I was totally into the song. And just for a second, I thought she was better than Blake Lewis. Well, those thoughts quickly passed. Not only was Blake Lewis's debut flat-out amazing and underrated, but due to the meat grinder that is radio, this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road. Today, this song blends right into the radio wasteland.  While her vocals are still good, it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing. I mean really, I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality, but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is.  Overall, if you have been in a cave for the past six months, consider buying this song. But just remember, when you head back for the cave, this song won't be coming with you.
0	Bad album; bad arrangements; bad companions; she shouldn't hold the notes anymore. Now it sounds like screaming.
0	Loved this CD and especially liked the booklet with all of the words to the songs!.
0	5 awful remixes that will make you want to sharpen the CD into a long pick that will pop your eardrums.
1	Classic!
1	There has no been question about Mariah Carey. She has been under a lot of pressure to really deliver with a strong cover. She has had a lot of weak cover songs that she has done over the years, from a lackluster cover of Journey's Open Arms, to a mixed cover of Brenda K. Starr's I Still Believe. While her best cover was of The Jackson 5's I'll Be There, she still needs to really deliver. With her latest single, a cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, the second single from her latest album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, she honestly has not done that. The song was absolutely a very weak and less than strong cover for a few reasons. One of them is that she missed recording an entire verse of the song from when Foreigner did it 25 years ago, and the second is that it missed the heart and soul that had been made from the song for years. Next to when Wynonna Judd covered the song a few years ago, this honestly has to be the least-enjoyed version of the Foreigner classic. I thought this was not a good idea for it to be a single from the album, and I was right. Better luck with Memoirs, Mariah. You really are going to need it, badly!!  Song: D 1/2-
0	Mary? I did know. I'm surprised you didn't.
1	Everything Miss Ronstadt sings is wonderful, never a disappointment.  I thoroughly an enjoying listening to this recording. The songs are to notch.
1	The new additions of two new singers has only made the group better.  Emmet has quicky become one of my favorites.  His voice is truly wonderful and delivery of songs is outstanding.  The best song on the CD however is done by Keith.  Now We Are Free is one of the best things he has ever done.  Did not know he had such a great range of voice and style.  The other songs are all great to listen to also.
1	Bought it twice, never rec. download either time! got charged for it anyway! Stay away from this song to download.
1	Wonderful songs! Pure Ronnie Dunn!
0	i cant believe them.  i watched all of there music videos and it seemz like they just put together a band to make punk go down the drain.  They talk about love to much.  That does not make punk.  im sick of seing all of these wannebes going on stage singing pop songs trying to make some freakin money.  but i tell ya they suk.  don't waste ur money.  in all of there songs they imatate blink 182, sum 41 and the like.  i cant stand it. they have meaninless lyrics too.
1	Do yourself a favor and don't buy this album. The first two tracks are solid, but the rest is utter junk. Honestly, I had heard the first two tracks, and I loved them. So I bought the album! Bad choice. The rest blows.
1	I expected it to be the same type of music as his previous cd.  However, this was not the case.  It has a bluegrass feel to it and it doesn't showcase his vocals as well as it could.
0	"Once More 'Round The Sun" is like crack cocaine for my ears:  One listen, and I was hooked.  Actually, I've been hooked on Mastodon since Remission or thereabouts.  Heavy and massive as the particles in the core of a black hole...and yet, I thought I heard some prog too.  Intriguing, since I'm also a hardcore King Crimson fan.  Hmmm...  Of course, all of this burst to the forefront on Crack The Skye.  As an artistic statement, that album was on par with Dark Side of the Moon, in my opinion.  Meticulous, precise, mathematical, while dialing back the thrash factor.  (Some have criticized this, but I loved it because the proggy elements could now come to the forefront.)  Emotive vocals, especially from drummer Brann Dailor who sang lead for the first time on this album.  The Hunter?  Yeah, I liked it, but it was something of a rebound album.  The band hadn't quite exhaled just yet.  They wanted to have some fun, after having worked so hard on Crack The Skye...but it sounded like a transition, a next step that they didn't quite take.  Well, they took that step now:  Once More 'Round The Sun is Mastodon playing with reckless abandon.  Their machine-precision tightness is now loosened up considerably, and in a good way.  Lots of crazy time signatures, awesome drum fills, stops and starts, layered vocals, etc.  This album makes me smile...not a manic, bang-your-head, headbanger grin, but a contented, bobble-head, happy-place smile.  It's the difference between ripping into a pack of beef jerky and chowing the whole thing at once, vs. savoring a filet mignon one tasty bite at a time.  I like both, but sometimes steak is really tasty.  Mastodon has finally exhaled.  Once More 'Round The Sun is the doubleplusawesome result, and I hope they continue to conquer new territory while the rest of us enjoy the ride.
0	The CD was blank.  What a rip-off.  Returned it.
1	The record was scratched and the sound was scratchy.
1	God Imagine Dragons are a one hit wonder that have not gone away.
0	Great product, great transaction!
0	This is impossible to listen. Nasal singing, no voice, no tonality, just mentioning Jesus in your lyrics doesnt make you an artist, this is disgrace to all the Christians, and I am offended that amazon would allow such atrocity. I will not even go into "borrowed" background beat noise...
1	I have had this song in my collection since the seventies. Would not ever care to give it up. In fact it reminds me of my wife every time I hear it.
0	This download included NO MUSIC... The downnload included only about ten or twelve spoken words, no song, no music, nothing worth listening to. This must be an Amazon problem rather than a problem with the muscician. I wasted my money on this download and I don't know who to contact for a refund. Amazon, help ???  Update: Amazon saw my note, engaged and gave me a full refund plus a pledge to repair.the problem. Amazon is a good thing....

1	I noticed it says clean in the CD check out .. is there a unrated ?
1	I did not order/purchase this item
1	Should have been the song, not all the dialog, and two verses? Wasted money!!
0	I love Testify!
1	I bought this album in hopes that it would contain most songs from the show. The ones that are featured on the album just didn't do it for me. I skipped through the entire album in about seven minutes and haven't played it since. It just wasn't what I expected.
0	I have seen TF play on the Bandwagonesque tour in the early 90's and back then I collected everything by them I could afford to buy. i enjoyed collecting and liked this cd back then, however it doesn't compare to other releases that came later on. If you want everything they ever made then get it but it's not as catchy and pop as the huge amount of brilliant stuff that followed. They are by far one of my favorite bands of all time...
0	I like Jason Aldean and I like people who push the boundaries of music.  But this is just country music stealing ideas, sounds, styles, from other music formats and adding twang to them.  Big and Rich did it much better.  The song has a killer hook, and I'm sure it'll be a smash hit... but Jason Aldean is better than this.
0	Classic
0	I love this song and Tommy Webb's heartfelt performance.
1	Classic
1	It's a great feel-good upbeat song. It makes me smile when I listen to it no matter what kind of day I'm having.
1	I liked this song. Yes, it is sorta top 40ish but is that bad? I prefer the song Blue Skies done by this group, which I think is worth buying if you liked this song.
1	it's just ok,  a little old fashioned
1	He has a very smooth way of singing songs so you can follow along with him. You need to listen and buy his music.
1	Quite a varied mix.  Perfect for what I was wanting.  Great to read by, nap by, or just hanging around the house.
1	Faith Hill just cannot sustain a note.  Josh Groban needs to find a better singing partner.  Horrible arrangement.
1	Want to go to sleep in a hurry? Play this song which may make you want to drink a case. BEAT IT!
1	After losing 30 lbs from a group hypnosis session, I thought this would provide reinforcement.  Unfortunately, I found that it is a very boring voice reading material not sufficient to put me to sleep, just to put me off.
0	Norm Hacking should be more well-known.  I bought it just to learn the song "John Dale," a wonderful story song.
1	For a movie based on an '80s children's cartoon, this soundtrack had some great tracks. I added this to my running playlist recently and it fires me up. The lyrics kinda make me wonder about the values being taught to kids in the '80s though. "If it's against the law you can bet I'll break it." Nice.
1	The songs all sound the same -- bad back up orchestration or at least not well matched with these standards.
1	The record was still in plastic but warped and does not play right.
1	Great
0	Great song!  The rest of the album is good too.
0	This was perfect Christmas music to play as background for a party I held.  A nice variety, soft smooth and excellent quality
1	This wonderful CD was highly recommended by a friend.  I'd like to pass along a similar message to all of you!  I bought Heart Lake and initially liked the CD, but man oh man has it ever grown on me!  This is music to warm the heart.  I keep it in the cd player at my desk and find it to be just perfect music to listen to as I work.  (I just stopped working in order to write this review and have the CD on as I type.)This music is also a very nice choice for romantic occasions (of which I would enjoy more often if I weren't working so much!) If you're like me and you might wear out your copy of Heart Lake, you may think about buying a second one so you can save a couple of bucks on shipping!
0	When this album arrived at our PO Box, we were heading from NC to PA for a summer trip. We started playing it and drove on, replaying it over and over. During our 2 week trip, we played it through, 38 times! We really counted. Each time, we'd hear something new, and the last song, in Finnish, flowed right into the first! The most perfect album we've ever heard.  It is still our favorite single album.
0	If there is honestly one thing I am very critical of, is that most of today's female singers do not even know how to really sing from the heart, especially in R&B. With so much sever overexposure from Beyonce' Knowles, and Rihanna, they are more corporate products than real singers from the heart. Tamia, who has been in music for 20 years, has had such a remarkable voice, but she has not really had been extremely overlooked with her songs like Officially Missing You and You Put A Move On My Heart. She has had such a remarkable voice, but not enough recognition. Her latest song Stuck With You, sounds better than her last work, Sandwich & A Soda, which wasn't a strong song for her heart and caliber. Her voice really drives in the song, and it is one of her better works from start to finish in quite awhile. Tamia is a great singer, but more needs to be done to get her work out there much further.  Song: B
1	I was informed that I would be able to install the song on my IPOD but I was not able to do that successfully.
1	Great buy
1	I too was interested in Holosync and, as usual, I came to Amazon to check the reviews.  Thankfully, I read the review by Matthew which mentioned a different product, Neuro Programmer 3.  After some internet research, I downloaded a free 2 week trial of NP3 and was literally amazed at what the program is capable of.  Holosync in itself is a decent option, that is if you have tons of money and want to be tied into somewhat outdated technology (binaural beats).  One thing that the glitzy ads for Holosync don't tell you is that after the CDs begin to lose their effectiveness for you, you will have to fork over more money - lots more money to keep getting more and more discs which will be more effective - until they begin to lose their effectiveness and you have to buy more discs...  The Holosync discs can be replicated rather simply with NP3, and you will never have to buy anything else.  With NP3, you can use binaural beats, monaural beats, or probably the most effective, isochronic tones.  I suggest that you check out NP3, and if you still think that Holosync is the answer for you then buy it.  It is a decent option for brainwave entrainment and as the reviews show, many people love it.  I have no affiliation with Transparent Corporation, the creator of NP3, nor did I receive any consideration from anyone for this honest review.
1	this song i heard on BPM on xm radio i immediately downloaded from amazon i love this song so much
1	This song also cuts off in the middle of the song. How can I please get a refund? Dayan Solis
1	Never recieved. Got lost in the cloud. I did not understand the download between my computer and the cloud. I do not want to sign an agreement for the cloud wherein I will end up paying. So I chose download and it got lost...maybe it is up in the clouds I do not know. Hesitant to buy any others.
1	Jewel has a beautiful voice which she basically wastes on these extremely corny lyriced, nearly nauseating songs.  There are only a few good songs on this CD, and the second half of the CD is revolting.  I wish Jewel would go back to her folk music, which was real and worth listening too.  Now, I blush at her banal, embarrasing lyrics, and disco worshiping beats. It is a shame, really.
1	I had a dream about five or six years ago that Bob Dylan had released a Christmas CD. No joke. Now it seems that the dream has come true. I can not believe the type of reviews that I've seen for this thing. Critisizing just about everything... from his voice, to his disloyalty to his Jewish heritage.  Hey... go back about thirty years and maybe your critisms will be relavant...  If you've been paying any attention to to the Didge these last fifteen years, you will notice that he has been on a kick trying to span a wide spectrum of Americana and roots like material. This is just another entry into that style. Surely if 1960's  Bob Dylan tried to do a Christmas album it would be quite strange (in my dream it was like "heeeeeee-eeeere coooommmes saaaaantahhhh!--") but considering the stuff he's done of late, this is right up his street.  It's fun... it's a bit comical, but if you put it on during the holidays, and don't tell anybody what it is... they'll either dig it, or won't know the difference from any other disc you put on. It's Dylans style of the last decade+ that I dig.  If you are still looking to him to be the voice of a sub culture, sorry, you missed the boat. I personally am holding out for the vinyl edition, available at the end of November, I can already tell it's gonna be rich, and I can't wait to play it for the fam over some heavilly boozed up nog and cider! Happy birthday JESUS!!!!
1	thought this redo would be better-didnt need to scream like a cat in heat.
0	I have been a fan for years now! This is sort a epic concept album about a owl against the world! I am very impressed with the quality of this release! The whole thing flows great! It has 2 not titled bonus tracks! I got something in my front pocket for you & Det Ar Alldeles Forsent are the titles of the tracks titles! They took a big risk with this release & it definitely paid off. I throughly enjoy every track on here all thriller no filler! Great elements of older & newer Avatar! Pick this up & turn it way up & enjoy! This is by far & away the best body of music they have released! Possible best Metal Album of the year right here! 5 horns thrown way up!!!!!
1	This album was a waste of my money. I don't like it at all, ever since mary has been happy her music has been lame. I enjoy her older albums when she was mad and going through things, she is great at expressing feelings and emotions but this is a poor effort. Her voice is losing its ummpph, and I wish she would get divorced so she can start making good music again. 2 thumbs down!
1	I loved this song from the first time i saw the video. This sing will definitely get you moving
1	Too many repeated sound track.
1	Chris Tomlin at his very BEST.Enjoy this praise song so much. Its beautiful..all nations coming together to worship God in song..simply beautiful.
0	This song is awful. Not much else to say.
1	I used this song in a fantastic CD I created. The CD is music to make love by...used 16 sexy and romantic songs.
1	I found one's I liked much better. I just couldn't get into this one. Too new age for me. Try JC apps.
0	I wanted to like this album more than I did. But after listening to it 10 times, yes, 10 times, it leaves me feeling empty. Maybe that's the point. However, I waited nearly 25 years for this release and I'm not satisfied with the final product. As others have mentioned, there's not enough genuine music here; aside from all the cheap parlor trick-sound effects, what do we have? The strumming of an acoustic guitar that barely varies from track to track? Waters has been one of my favorite musical artists for about 38 years now. I've listened to his music thorough his years with Floyd and all his solo albums, including his turn at creating an opera. I don't feel as if Waters has grown as an artist; it's as though his stuck in this conceptional bubble of loathing and other-hatred. I'm tempted to say self-hatred, but it's abundantly clear that Waters, ironically, loves himself. He is indeed disenchanted with mankind, but somehow views himself apart from the rest. "If I were God" indeed. There are some decent moments on this album when it is listened to in its entirety. On a personal note, I find Waters obvious rant against Trump disturbing and decidedly one-sided politics. For example, how do you wail against drone strikes when the former president (Obama) issued more drone strikes than any other president, including Bush? Waters sat back eight years in silence with Obama at the helm and said nothing other than Obama was an affable guy who is humble. Really? When Waters was recording most of this music, Trump hadn't even announced that he was running for office. Then, after a stint of not more than five months to date, suddenly the worlds woes are because of Trump? This isn't beside the point of the music because Waters went as far as including an audio clip of Trump's voice...think about that. Trump hadn't even taken office yet when Waters mastered this in January, and the world's problems were directly because of him? Waters music should be about writing good songs, not playing a political cheerleader for the party he has sold his soul to (except that he hasn't really sold his soul). How do you write against capitalism when you are the supreme beneficiary of it? Why do you live in America to avoid paying England's outrageous taxes if you're really for the "little guy"? It's a farce, and as you get older, you realize that the only thing being played here is those who buy the music. You can't be living in a mansion in the Hampton's and then screech "there's no such thing as being too much greedy" in a satirical sense. How is anyone with half a brain going to take this seriously? Waters, of course, is infected with hubris, which disallows him to recognize the outrageous irony of his own words.
1	First of all this song is annoying, and Carly can't sing live. I hate how famous this song is it has no purpose or meaning. She's only famous cause of bieber.
1	In October 2001, his adoring legion of fans finally received the third installment of the revamped, synthesizer-infused second phase of rock-poet, Leonard Cohen's career. The nine-year gap between releases can be accredited to Cohen's long stay at a Zen-Buddhist monastery, adopting a life of meditation and reflection. The mind-set of that environment is reflected several ways on Ten New Songs: the secluded recording sessions (Almost all of Cohen's accompaniment comes from back-up vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, cowriter and producer, Sharon Robinson); the ever-placid pace of the music; the spiritual nature of songs like "By the Rivers Dark" and "Love Itself" and the album's considerable increase in reflection and introspection. Where on 1988's I'm Your Man and 1992's the Future, Cohen often criticized society, on Ten New Songs the focus has been shifted to the intimate as Cohen evaluates the nature of living on tracks such as "Here It Is" and "A Thousand Kisses Deep" and his own role in it on tracks such as "Boogie Street" and the gorgeous "In My Secret Life." Obviously, Cohen had gathered much insight during his retreat from music. Ten New Songs is the distinctive, engaging and deeply inspired follow-up for which we have patiently waited and hoped.
1	It may be ahead of its time, but really..........its NOT GOOD JAZZ MUSIC!  I sounds to me more like kids making noise.
0	One of Jeff's two best songs. This singer songwrter can knock it out of the part, when he finds a subject he is loyal to.
0	Actually I really love this version of the track and was glad to purchase it.  However after purchasing and downloading, I realized that  the track's time of play was only 6:09.  The actual full version of this track is 9:33, essentially cutting out the entire section of the fantastic rhythmic organ riff which makes this song great.  Therefore, BEWARE: If you purchase this song, know that you are NOT getting the full original version.
0	I wanted a cd of songs by Chris Tomlin, including Amazing Grace.  It was a cd to accompany a singer.  I returned it. The information on the cd before I ordered it was unclear, at least to me.
1	We love, love, LOVE this CD!!! FINALLY!! Songs written for actual verses from the Bible!! My kids already know all the books of the Bible because of the fun and catchy melodies!  And the African kids choir voices and African-inspired beat and style in many of the songs is just beautiful!!! Well done Randall!  Hearing Sally Lloyd Jones' voice was a special treat too!  Who knew she is an alien? ;)  I am buying this as a gift for all my nieces and nephews and my kids' friends.
1	I'm not at all a fan of Katy Perry, but this song is just really catchy! Both of my kids and I love to shout the lyrics at the top of our lungs while we're driving.
0	I have always love his music, a very talented young singer that learned to speak Spanish through music, excellent CD I enjoy it every day
1	I recieved this as a gift from Karen and I found it a great selection of music for everyone to listen to. I am a harpist and this CD demonstrates wonderful harp playing along with other instumental accompanyments.
1	You'll like this song . . . There are several people who perform this. Most notably Bob Marley. However, I always liked this version better. I'm glad they had it.
1	Unfortunately, listening to rain for this long does not calm me. It makes me want to check all of my windows to see if the rain comes in and it makes me want to pee!
0	Love this song even more now since it was my husband favorite song.  It always brings a tear to my eye.
1	Love these songs.  So glad they recorded this album since Merle has passed away.  Great music.
1	to listen to again and again..
1	My favorite Prince song
1	I was unable to import it to my computer or my ipod so the whole episode was entirely unsatisfactory.  I wasted the points I had earned by purchasing a Kindle.  How can I rate something that I cannot play?
0	Excellent music. Fast shipping.
0	fun song, I wish it did not sound like my own family. My new favorite holiday tune. Love this Boston band.
1	This album is yet another fantastic offering from Bloc Party. A little more straightforward rock than the others the musical ability is more apparent because with a little less synth. Overall a really good album.
1	Sounds good, easy to download to iTunes,nice bonus from my Kindle Fire.  I can't think of eight more words to write about it.
0	I wish I had listened to the other reviews about the quality. I am by no means an "audiophile" but this quality is unbearable. It sounds like half the track is playing through blown out speakers - and I can guarantee that my equipment is in perfect condition. I am very disappointed because I love this song, but the low quality makes it downright useless. I will never listen to this file again.
1	Zapp - their first hit. I remember buying this album in 1980 - I also remember this song jamming at a block party in "The Locks" in Miami.
1	if you have ever listened to music with your head phones only plugged 1/2 way in wondering why only part of the tracks are playing at once....then you know what I mean. sounds like the bass line and other adiou tracks are missing. do not buy. what a rip off.
0	This album brings the music from The Last Herald Mage trilogy alive.  A trilogy in which music is so important to the culture of the characters, and which at the end has several pages of lyrics to the ballads and songs mentioned in the story - is brought to life.  The style is medieval/bardic/folk and very true to how you would imagine the songs to be, from reading the books.
1	This is a badass album from start to finish. I'd highly recommend you check this album out. You will not be disappointed.
1	ok.
0	I love Christina and I tried my hardest to like her Bionic cd, but it just wasn't her same type of music. It was filled with stupid songs that didn't speak from her soul like she usually does. Her Lotus cd is taking her back to the time when she wrote amazing songs and had fantastic rhythms to go with them. The entire cd is fantastic! I can't stop listening to it.
0	Very dissapointed in this CD. None of the good soul sounding tracks or a good a ddance number . Rather bland for such a powerful voice.
0	Not as good as advertised.  Just 1 or 2 songs that harmonize and tell a good story!  Listen to all the songs at amazon.com and buy only those you like for 99c.
0	We all love listening to this song.  The kids at Sunday school want to sing this at church for the congregation
0	"Small Y'all" is a lesser known song pulled from an album recorded late in George Jones phenomenal career. This is a short ditty & a fun tune. Lyrics like "don't it make you feel mean, Gene"...remind me of Paul Simon's, "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover":.."step out the back, Jack", etc. Again, I say it's a FUN song,, short & sweet..& poignant. This should have been a hit but even Ol' Possum's most ardent fans are unaware of this one. If you like George Jones, this is a must-have.....a real coolector's item. "Small Y'all is BIG FUN !!!
1	Respect their willingness to move in their own new directions. But, what I liked about Mumford & Sons is absent in this record, and what is new isn't my thing.
1	Easy listening... cool voice.  Will download entire album based on my love of this single!  Love it, Love it, Love it!
0	I love this cd I used to listen to it on my way to school of the morning and really enjoy the melodies on this cd.
1	great
1	I am only typing this section out because they make you leave a comment regardless if you want to or not.
1	Great song.  Can listen to it over and over again.
0	No thank you....
0	Good songs
1	I love this song.  I'm nearly sixty years old and this song brings back very very dear memories of a dead friend who I used to dance with back in the day.  He died in his thirties.
0	i love this group. this is a wonderful, uplifting song. make you want to dance and love the day. everyone should have this song.
1	the first half of this cd is pretty awful then all of a sudden robert lamm appears and Chicago discovers some of its jazz/rock roots. the second half of the cd makes it worth buying but wait till you can get it cheap,which it will be in a couple of months !
1	With George Clinton's increasing interesting in bringing in more and more newer (and often younger) musicians into his P-Funk musical empire? It was bound that not only would financial and generation clashes as well. This all came to play in the late 70's when the core of George Clinton's original vocal group Fuzzy Haskins,Calvin Simon and Grady Thomas abruptly re-emerged in 1981 with the name Funkadelic in hand and bought in a group of their own with Michael Williams,Billy Moms,Ben Powers Jr.,Johnny Quad Riley,Stan Thorn and Ken Blackmon  and put this album out,as they announced at every chance possible,without any participation from Clinton.    "Phunklords" starts out the album with a brightly melodic layer of synthesizers of the plassic P-Funk "video game" sounding variety before launching into a straight up bass heavy,percussive keyboard sound with vocals that trade off very singable melodic lines as well as the call and response chants of classic style funkativity. This also extends into "You'll Like It Too",the title song and "Come Back" as well. All are very strong on that level. "The Witch" ends the first side in three parts: a low voiced vocal proclimation at the beginning,then onto a slinky new wave electric and synth bass driven slither on "The Infunktation" and ending on the rocking guitar groove of "The Cellfunction".    "Call The Doctor" is a slow crawling,wah wah power deep voodoo funk groove while "Whose A Funkadelic" is led by a round synth bass pulse and a high pitched chipmunk style vocal rap with a sea of Eddie Hazel style guitars. Considering this album is led essentially the melodically inclined vocal end of the original Parliaments group of the 1960's? Their barber shop style gospel soul leads and harmonies help beef up what is essentially a very uptempo funk oriented album that strips away the more eccentric elements of Clinton's spin on P-Funk and concentrates on a very coherent sound that is incredibly rhythmic and melodically powerful. It's an excellent album that succeeds at being P-Funk which works as both a singers and a keyboardists/musicians album all at the same time. And despite the damage it caused to the whole of P-Funk to release this as it was? It's a powerful album embracing the side of P-Funk that would help spearhead the smaller group,synth/electro funk of the early/mid 80's that had arrived. Highly recommended!
0	I love this lyrics to the song and the music! It has such a great message! This song is worth buying and listening to over and over again.
1	This is a lot of music for just $0.99!  Different and varied groups performing.  How can you go wrong?  To the Debbie Downers who claim there are duplicate songs...  Its 260 something songs, there might be a duplicate or two, you paid less than a penny for the song get over it!  I'm happy with the purchase and would buy it again.
1	Excellent songs in a variety of styles.  Great CDs.  MJ will always be the best entertainer in the world!
0	I think it's the most beautiful song I've heard and I have a CD of it both the house and the car and play it over and over especially during the Christmas season.
1	Great song for my road trips!

1	A long time ago I picked up a Gary McFarland sheet music book at a tag sale.  Since that day I've really enjoyed playing his rich and surprising compositions.  Some of his recordings, on the other hand, left me cold, especially that dang humming thing he did on so many LPs.  Masters has chosen some of McFarland's nicest tunes and addressed them with a highly competent ensemble.  The orchestrations are really nice as are the solos, Smulyan in particular.  I do feel the record (at north of 80 minutes) could be shorter, however.  I found it a lot to try to absorb.
0	It is fast paced, the trumpet play is excellent, the singing goes wkth the mood and tune, the guitar work is appropriate and brilliantly performed.
1	Excellent Idea!  Many people complain about the genre, but I think it's great.  This shows that Futurepop/EBM/Industrial/Darkwave/Synthpop...  Whatever you want to call it (as they all tend to change their style over time from the artists) is showing this music is evolving.  Old schoolers might hate it, new comers will love it.  Whatever it is, this sampler is great!  I am impressed they offer this, as I am a dj who buys music through here and even amazed that Amazon carries such artists just blows my mind.
0	Disappointing!!! Let me start by saying that I am a Big Fan and was rooting for Youg Buck Last Season --But this CD is the worst of all the initial releases from any of the the Top Finalist over the past few years. The two up-tempo songs - the Mary Mary Remake and the Isaac Carree songs were pretty good.(The reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1.  However, the remainder of the songs simply features Joshua mostly screaming instead of singing......performing runs for no apparant reason.  Get back to singing.......The Producer did not do him a favor.........We generally give all the young winners the benefit of the doubt on the first release -- which usually consists of maybe a new song or two and recordings from the Season of Sunday's Best. -- But we can't even do that for this offering.......My Wife and I are thoroughly disappointed.  I hope the right people see this review and take heed, because I want the yomg man to be successful....No doubt he has a gift......  .
1	Henley is a lyrical and musical genius, but he dumbs it down to country on this release. I don't know if it's pandering or just plain laziness. At any rate it's a disappointment. The lyrics are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world. Musically it's either country waltz or three chord rockabilly. Don't waste your money on this one.
0	love the C.D. great music awesome voice. i have all of his C.D.s and i love all of his songs. he is the only artist that ive listened to all of his songs and loved them all.
0	I really enjoyed this, I had  a Mr. Know it all. So the words really meant something. Great music!! Excellent
1	I thought I would swallow the Sufjan Stevens pill since it seems that everyone thinks he is a musical genius.  Thankfully I didn't pay full price, but I couldn't even finish the last song.  This is a bunch of electronica crud that shouldn't be passed as music.  Listening to it is not even remotely enjoyable.  I do hope his other stuff is of better musical quality than this because if it's not there are a lot of really undiscerning ears out there.  By the way, if I could have given it zero stars I would have.
1	This has CULT CLASSIC written all over it! For the complete "Hamlet 2" experience, you MUST own this CD. BUY IT NOW!
0	Song is good if you are a waka flocka fan
0	Amaze-balls.
0	Overall I am really disappointed. About three good songs but has a downward tug that is depressive.
0	Good all around album.
1	Every time I'm looking through my albums for whole, joy-filled, heaven-pointing music this is what I choose. It is so very well arranged and performed. I get the sense that they actually were singing to the Lord, not just to my ears. Do not hesitate to get this album.
1	so much about sex and women and not about any else. he is so talented why is he so one sided.
1	I wasn't able to download it to my amazon prime library. I'm sinning the download, not the song.
1	Independently produced, this cd carries pure energy disguised in sound; short pieces full of sweetness and tenderness, contrasted with long and thick electronic works with social and religious criticism; nothing but the truth comes out from this outstanding author, who is a writer as well. if there were 10 stars, they would be deserved to the very spark they emanate with every note from this true master piece.
0	Great song good quality
1	Love the song, not so much the choice but that's on him.....
0	I enjoyed being able to listen to the album on vinyl but the mix isn't the same. Some of the metro boomin tags were cut out, which are some of the most important parts.
0	The style of music is very pleasing to listen to and the quality is great.
0	Don't believe the hype. Honestly, from a musical perspective this album is a mess. The production and mixing are a bad joke, and the bands arrangements leave a lot to be desired. It sounds like the band sleewalked through the entire recording and Wade's voice is voco-coded to death cos he has no range. An avid fan will doubtless overlook these glaring faults at first but ask them again in a year if they're still playing this dog's dinner of an album. One more thing, just who is their drummer? He's shocking, the session drummer outplays him by a million miles. Why was a session drummer brought in to begin with? The answer is simple, they have very little talent as musicians. Avoid.
1	Madonna's "Who's That Girl" sets a much faster pace than her "La Isla Bonita" which goes at a slow pace.  The song is marked by spanish motifs and words, obviously her favorite culture.  This song makes me feel good to be a girl.  This song has intrinsic value in my life.
1	I think this song is so fun! I originally heard it in my zumba class but it's just so fun!
0	I got turned on to Flyleaf after their self titled release in 2005, having no idea they were a christian band.  Listening to their frist CD, one would not really realize this unless you really focused on the lyrics, and even then, there was some stuff open to interpritation.  On Momento Mori, Flyleaf goes into full on christian rock mode, with practically every song heavy in religious overtones.  For this non-believer, it's just too much.  Having read a few interviews with the band (mostly Lacey), and hearing them say, repeatedly, that they are not a christian band although all members are christians I expected Momento Mori to be at least somewhat secular in nature but it's not.  The songs are all strong, I just don't want the sermon.  I'll pass on future Flyleaf offernings I guess.
1	extremely annoying.
1	You might think this musical had something to do with the movie, and therefore some of the movie's incredible iconic score would somehow be integrated into the musical version.  You would be wrong.
1	I have been a Panic fan since they first came out.  Every album gets better and better.  Each album has it's own persona and I absolutely love Brendon's voice.  Amazing song writers never let their fans down.  Love this album!
0	OMG... this song has become my latest addiction!!! i listen to it over and over and over.. its the perfect description of how Ana and Christian start out!!
0	awesome album, worth it, MUSE are amazing with every album
1	This is one great record! A must-have if you're looking for some great oldies with a sense of humor! Parodies (Leader of the Laundromat), nonsensicals (Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop), cartoons (Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron), this album has something for everyone!
1	I love Reba but I never got the CD.U u u u u u u u u u u u
0	This is an uplifting song that I first heard on the Today Show.  I love it and I will be looking into more of their music.
0	Exactly as expected.  I really like it. I listen to it on my workouts and runs.  It's very motivating.  I would buy again.
0	Great cd I highly recommend it
0	Great song
0	Wonderful, thanks to GOD.
0	Love this song.
1	I was listening to an album of Mr Coulton's when I found my ears perk up in confusion. What was this, "I like big butts; I cannot lie" this sounds familiar... So I kept listening to it. Sure enough it was Sir Mix-A-Lot's song. I spent the next 4 minutes or so laughing.
0	While I was looking forward to sampling this CD, since it was a local Omaha artist, I found the selections to be performed without the verve that usually accompanies ragtime. The playing did not seem sharp and song selections routine. Overall the CD was just dull.
1	Pat Travers...nuff said
0	This guy over stresses syllables making it super annoying to listen to. I felt like I was listening to a big nerd.
1	The BEST ever cover of this song!
1	The main selling point here is the cult-classic set of Ren Leibowitz's nine Symphonies of Beethoven, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Leibowitz's accounts were recorded for Readers Digest Classical Collection in 1961-62 using the acoustically excellent Walthamstow Town Hall in London, under producer Charles Gerhardt and legendary Decca Sound Engineer Kenneth Wilkinson. Leibowitz was an extremely talented but relatively unsung conductor. I'd never previously heard the set, but my rummaging around on the web suggests that it has been prized by connossiers for many years in various LP & CD versions--and with good reason. I'd been impressed with anything I else ever heard by Leibowitz, so when this popped up for really cheap, I had to grab it. The sound is quite good for its era, and the pace is always brisk and intense without losing lyricism. Up to now, I've listened to Symphonies 3, 5, 6, 7 & 8 and all are in my mind really impressive. I'm looking forward to hearing the others, and the other material in the collection. The sound is bright and vivid, with plenty of impact--and this suits the VERY energetic performance style. Sometimes in really loud passages there's a wee bit of overload, but I'll take that over a muffled sounding recording.  This would be a very good starter set of the Symphonies for beginning collectors who don't already have one, but it will also provide a fresh way for jaded collectors to hear these wonderful but perhaps overfamiliar warhorses .  A couple of points: 1) In general, these versions are very fast (in a good way--they're energetic and clearly articulated without being rushed). Just for a little context, Leibowitz takes the first movement of the Eroica in 12:34. Toscanini takes 13:46. Munch takes 13:59. Karajan ('63) takes 14:44. Krips takes 14:50. Klemperer takes 16:41. Leibowitz has the late Sir Thomas Beecham's Royal Philharmonic in its prime playing full out and the recordings are anything but routine. Even if you have many versions of the 9, you might be hearing an approach to the symphonies that you haven't heard before. 2) There's a sense of unfolding drama. I was listening to the 5th for the first time this morning and my college-senior son (a classical music fan who lives at home) wandered into my home office. He immediately volunteered, "This is a really good performance!" Then he sat down and we listened to the whole symphony together. Now please excuse the rest of the anecdote, but about 3 minutes from the end of the Finale, my son mentioned, "Gee, I need to go to the bathroom, but I need to hear how this turns out." So we listened to the ending, talked about the impact of the coda, and then he headed off to the facilities. He could have asked me to pause the recording, but he didn't want to let go of the experience.  The Beethoven sonatas I've listened to so far by O'Reily are not bad. I haven't listened to the other performances, but the Leibowitz versions of the symphonies alone would be worth your $1.09. Given how good they these, I'm not really worried about the duplications in tracks 89-99. Based on similar issues with other mp3 sets, I do sometimes wonder if the folks who assemble these compliations have any idea what they're doing, but in this case we've lucked out with a rare and really cool set of the Symphonies--and more!
0	Excellent!!
1	Very nice song writer
0	Trying to stay motivated while running is hard enough, so I am down to using gadgets and music to keep me motivated.  I bought this to keep motivated while running and I always pickup my pace when I hear it.
1	Seems that  they lost their mind on the price......
1	Unclassified is Robert Randolph's second album, but his first studio effort. His first album, Live At Wetlands, showed that Mr. Randolph plays one mean steel guitar. The question would be if that same sweat and fire could be recreated in the studio. The answer is a resounding yes. Mr. Randolph cut his teeth playing in a Pentecostal church in his hometown of Orange, New Jersey and the album has clear gospel roots. But the band is really more of a funk and roll band in the Parliament-Funkadelic mold. Mr. Randolph's steel guitar is often counterbalanced by popping bass lines and wailing organs. "So Refreshing" has a funky bass and buzz saw steel riff and "Squeeze" has fiery organs that perfectly contrast the wicked steel guitar. "I Need More Love" has a call and response chorus that sits atop a hard funk groove that is very Stevie Wonder like. "Smile" slows things down and features tender harmonies. "Calypso" has a Latin-jazz-rock Santana vibe and "Run For Your Life" closes out the disk on a full-out Jersey bar sound. Robert Randolph is one of the most gifted guitarists to come around in a long time and his music demands your attention.
0	Nice neo-country music.  Like I mean, real county.  I wanna say George Jones or Merle Haggard, but that would be an overstatement.  But definitely more in that direction than the pop anthem drivel that gets passed off for country far too often.
1	Don Moen's gift as a worship leader is evident in this cd/dvd. He brings the hearer along with him as he celebrates, praises; then acknowledges who God is and what He can do. The songs of quiet praise are welcome. You will be blessed by this worship.  It is not meant to be a performance.
1	Great song. I love it.
1	First of all, I really liked the 80s looking CD cover and the title "Oh Snap". Even before I started listening to the CD, I had this expectation that the songs would be a little more playful and fun than usual Christian music. I wasn't mistaken. These guys sound like they enjoy what they are doing and having fun with some punk-inspired music. It's hard to say that it is punk-rock, but I would say it is punk-inspired pop music. The lyrics are mostly uplifting, but not too cheesy. If you are into Christian music and looking for something different within that area, I recommend picking this album up.
1	One of the best guitar players. Definitely on the same level as Hendrix etc. Unfortunately, he never got the attention he deserved.
1	Wonderful!
1	Really stinks that Amazon does not provide a better vetting process before wasting money on songs that contain shout outs.  I bought this to play at parties and wanted the clean version, unfortunately this is the clean version but contains junk shout outs.  There's a clean version out there without the shout outs under Let's Go (edited album version) with a black album cover.  Thanks Amazon also for no return policy on MP3 purchases.
1	I'll admit to being super surprised when I pulled out a pink vinyl, but in a happy-ecstatic I didn't drop the $59.99 for the "for sure going to be pink" version and instead just got this, and happened upon getting the beautiful pink limited edition version. Makes it slightly more Purim-Miracle feeling.  It's beautiful, doesn't skip on any of the tracks which with my old player is a miracle in and of itself never mind the pink. Halsey is one of my favorite singers and as I am slowly building up my vinyl collection, I kept thinking I already had this on vinyl. I didn't, just played the MP3 version enough times that I assumed I *must* have it. Halsey's lyrics are personal, but in a universal way that you feel like maybe she knows your story and wrote a song about it, or at the very least she's lived it. She's not self-indulgent, though, which is important.  She has compassion for herself, and that plus empathy for others. Her voice is beautiful. It has a pop-punk from the early 00's feel to it, but her music is unique enough that I'm not feeling that exact vibe listening to her. It's a nice difference from the majority of pop albums today that either try to hard to deviate from the expected pop form that it becomes even more formulaic. She exerts her unique sound just by doing her thing.  5/5 would recommend; and good luck to others hoping for an LE one :)
1	What a disappointment!  I guess Enrique must be desperate to sell music now.  He has to be crude and vulgar to sell songs.  It used to just be the rappers.  Now it's becoming the pop "artists" as well.  I wouldn't actually call him an artist anymore.  Just a money-hungry egomaniac who doesn't care what crap he puts out there, as long as we make him rich.  Wake up, people!  I used to be a fan but not anymore.  Buy songs that are from true artists and that's what the radios will play and the record companies will promote.  Buy crap like this and we get what we deserve.
1	This is NOT better than rainbow connection or Milk Cow Blues... in fact this is the worst willie record since that last major label travesty "Across the Borderline" and at least that one had "still is still moving".  None of these songs will become willie classics...  Simply put, this record sounds nothing like willie...it is overproduced and sappy...and why one of the greatest songwriters of all time would do a bunch of rob thomas and bernie taupin songs is beyond me... that said, probably one of the better pop releases this year so far, and whatever they play off of this on the radio will still be better than having to listen to clay walker or creed, so at least there's that... Decent pop record, horrible willie record.
1	Poor quality
1	Defineately shows Jackie's Lower Octave and Feelins and emotions in this haunting melody LUV IT.
1	Imagine getting "It's a Small World" stuck in your head....
0	I love My Chemical Romance and so of course I would love this song. Such a shame they broke up.
1	My daughter got married in a barn, yes, a barn. It was a great time and this music worked out great!
1	Wonderful Song
1	The sound quality on this download is not good at all. It's extremely low. You can barely hear.
1	I really love this song and the music was perfect!
1	Don't buy this junk from K-TEL. The singers should be ashamed about the way they sing the songs. Look for authentic recordings of these artists. I couldn't delete  this junk from my hard drive fast enough!
1	I chose the #5 rating because it deserves this. I love this song and "The BodyGuard" Movie is One of my favorites and this song, "I Want To Run To You" is One of the Greats By Whitney Houston. R.I.P, Whitney!
1	Great song, makes me cry every time I hear it play, it is the best I think I've ever heard.
1	Can anyone explain to me the music business or litigation decision that took out one of my favorite songs on this album, "Front Page News," and replace it with a bland song that is completely different?  Has anyone else noticed this?  Yes, there is a "Front Page News" listed, but click on it and it is not the great song - it is a completely different one?  It is the same at iTunes, so I suspect some lingering Lowell George resentment or legal issues, but there should be a disclaimer.  This is the best song on the album, and it is "replaced" by a completely different song - yet they keep the title?  Can anyone explain???
1	Because there are 2 good songs and this album is $15, I suggest to not bother. Only for the hardcore Katy fans that love everything she does.
1	Some things from other reviews that I completely agree with;  There are few "real songs" on this disc.  Snare and Kick sound robotic or like a triggered sample.  The writing can seem very repetitive. It sounds more like a movie score album, at times even Disney-like.  I gave this disc multiple tries.  Nothing pulled me in.  Dream Theater has defined itself with a catalog full of 6,7 plus minute songs that take turns yet mostly come back to a great hook.  Here, we have one song out of 34 over 7 minutes.  It's the nature of the Rock Opera format I suppose but to me it produces a lack of musical focus.
1	shes Rihanna whats not to love
1	Very unique. Almost has a "western" feel to it. One of those songs that get "stuck" in your head.
1	If you want this spiritually rapt Requiem chirped as if a yellow smiley face has been pasted across it, here you go. But I hear no emotional depth in this performance. To me, the Faure Requiem is an exercise in spiritual chiaroscuro. It's about the darkness being penetrated by the light; but it's the light of stained glass casting itself across the dark shadows of an awesome cathedral. Pale, little boy wannabes in the soprano section can't make that happen. Neither can all the smooth, rounded edges of Rutter's approach. Robert Shaw was a little square in spots, but the Atlanta recording on Telarc is one of his best. Laurence Equilbey's Accentus chamber choir does a beautiful job with the Requiem, though a few more cuddles from the soprano section might have been nice. Herreweghe also gave us a good one. He may have period tendencies, but there's far more depth to the performance than you'll ever find here. There's nothing unpleasant about Rutter's offering, but it leaves out the intensity that makes the piece special.
1	I love this song from the very first time I listened to it. This is grwagreat I recommend anyone give ot a listen.
1	For the session its the Best can't go wrong,  Mr. Hollens and Jackie Evancho
0	How do you find this after its purchased?!
0	I did not purchase this.???
1	Not much to cheer for here, just a reminder of why some people never make it past the bar scene.
1	I bought this CD a week ago, and yes, Lucinda Williams is still the greatest living songwriter (though I might say she possibly currently shares that honor with Ryan Adams). The most visceral portrayal of heartbreak in verse and song ever, ever...Lucinda you are still the angel of ensanguined love.
1	This ridiculously lavish box will make committed Clash fans and collectors swoon. You get every Mick Jones-era album remastered brilliantly for modern listeners (among other things, the low end has been juiced up for playback on mobile devices and computers) and sounding great, especially on a proper stereo.  You get a big helping of unreleased tracks that have all been given good sound. You get a DVD packed with videos and live performances. You get liner notes written by both the band and just about every key person from the band's personal entourage and studio crews. You get stickers and badges to replace the ones you regret using or losing back in the day. You get random objects that have no discernable purpose. All in high quality, historically faithful, and sturdy packaging throughout.  Other bands and record labels issuing deluxe sets would do well to study Sound System closely. Sound System easily matches the cool boxes put out by Rhino during its heyday and even comes close to the opulent limited editions put out by Revenant Records. Too many jumbo sets these days skimp on one or more things, such as sound quality, booklets, replica album sleeves, or tchotchkes. Not Sound System.  There are a couple of small things that keep Sound System from being perfect though. First, just like in the Singles box set, the "Cost of Living EP advert" coda to Capital Radio II is missing. I also think both versions of "Inoculated City" should have been included since so many vinyl albums were sold without the 2000 Flushes sample. These are quibbles, especially since it isn't that difficult to dig up online posts of either track, but these omissions stick out in such a high quality set.  Bottom line: a fantastic acquisition for big time fans and completists, despite the two minor faults.  Newcomers to the Clash who want the essentials all in one go--plus saving some $$$ as well--might be better off picking up&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/5-Album-Studio-Set/dp/B00CUKTGW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">5 Album Studio Set</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Singles/dp/B000HCPU0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Singles</a>&nbsp;instead. Four stars.
1	While the music is very calming, the voiceover completely unsettles the calm.  The voice information should have been provided on a paper insert, an not over the music.  I will never play this CD again.  The title is correct, though, 'Stress Free With Deepak Chopra'... it is stress free, with Deepak voicing over and adding the stress.  Consider that while entering a stress free mental state, that one's mind is not working to create words from emotion, nor interpret words into meaning.  The constant words draws the calm mind into un-calm, as the mind is called to interpret the meaning from the words.  Deepak, if indeed that is your name, produce this CD with no voice over.
1	Two of the best songwriters and arrangers in the business and this is the best they can come up with?  spare me!  emmylou even slaughtered the wonderful "Spanish Dancer" by Patti Scialfa.  Jesus peeps, we're still paying attention.
1	There were only a few songs i liked....not what i expected..
1	I have to say this is my first Immolation cd , I was expecting this to be brutal , which it very much is, but much much more than that. Great Vocals,Amazing guitar and drumwork. At times i'm reminded of Gorguts or Meshuggah with the polyrhythmic way of playing. This cd can be haunting (see the beginning of "of martyrs and men" , and "rival the eminent") as well as just downright brutal. I also enjoy the lyrics very much, instead of just full out blasphemy they actually thought about what they were going to write (heres an example from "sinful nature", how can we live with ourselves  our jealousy, our tyranny  the lives we make, the lives we take  the fools we serve, the fools we are). Overall i'd recommend this very much so to anyone looking for a not just your typical death metal band.
0	I have no idea why this song is so addicting, but it is. As usual with Ke$ha, the lyrics aren't that great, but the beat is very catchy. This is good music to listen to in a dance club.
0	Worst live (non-bootleg) cd I've EVER heard.  Other reviewers have remarked on how Dave's voice on his weaker songs is faded out, and I had to laugh.  On their tour in 2008, I had seats 4 rows from the stage in the dead middle. Dave's voice was so weak that they were doing that IN CONCERT.  I wish Eddie had done Hagar's idea and done a tour with BOTH, instead of Sammy and Dave doing their own tour.  On that tour, Dave's voice was still decent.  This is why I don't understand the Anthony thing.  So let your kid play bass, Eddie, and keep Anthony as a backup singer to Dave, because you and Wolfie can't sing either.
1	This is a really beautiful song, unfortunately this cover version does not do the song justice. The original by Tears for Fears displays a variety of human emotions - anger, depression, hurt, a profound sense of alienation, a degree of hope, a tiny bit of humor at the end in the form of an inside joke...  This cover has one emotion that drags interminably like a dirge. It saddens me that so many people have come to expect so little that just because there is a pretty melody people think it is ok that their palate of emotions can be reduced to something 2 dimensional like this effort. Stick with the original.
0	download arrived in good shape, although out of all the downloads many of them do not play all the way to end.
0	I love Olly Murs voice.  This is new music and so good to listen too.  Makes you sing loud in your car and want to dance all night long.  Totally awesome!
0	Great song. Great band!
1	Love it!
0	Kelly is perfect. She can do no wrong at all. Don't any of you forget that ok. She is amazing.
1	Actually, I love the song. But Amazon's insistence that you download their music app just to be able to download an mp3 that you already paid for? That's nonsense.  I won't buy another mp3 through Amazon.
1	This CD consisted of only two tracks. They were hardly audible, scratchy and muffled. I was expecting a one with all songs from her original CD. I was VERY disappointed in quality and lack of music. I won't buy from this seller again.
0	Love this rendition of a classic!
0	Of course, great contradance musice with Rodney Miller on fiddle and the back-up including Peter Barnes! It could be nothing less.
1	This song is so great! It has tons of emotion and the music that accompanies such great words is amazing. I would definitely advise anyone to add this to their Carrie Underwood collection.
0	great music
1	Wasn't a fan.
1	Couldn't find it after the down load
1	Great!
0	Although not one of their greatest hits, this song still has their signature sound and the lyrics are quite appealing to someone who has serious misgivings about technology. The song was certainly better than the movie it was made for.
0	I have heard much better performances singing in karaoke bars, don't waste your time or money unless you collect no hit wonders
1	Sweet! Love this band and never even knew about this album!
1	As it turns out someone is upset that they are saying Led Zepplin stole this and morphed it into Stairway to Heaven.  Guess I'm tone deaf because I sure don't hear it.  I have heard Stairway so many stinking times on the Radio my skin crawls,  the skin didn't crawl with Taurus.
1	This song really spoke to me on a very spiritual note.  I absolutely love it. I have learned to play this song and sing it and I get request for it everyday.
1	Great song. Brings back such good memories.
0	I went through days of singing this over and over....
1	Influences from Terminator, John Carpenter, Vangelis, and just about every 80s sci fi action movie, but all as a coherent whole with its own theme. Really great music to work to. :)
1	I bought this album because of the price. This music isn't terible, it's just cliche as hell. This is like a really bad ELP tribute band. You will get bored and won't even want to continue after the first song. The little tv- quotes were annoying and very hard to understand. I reccomend Glass Hammer instead.
1	greaat
1	A beautiful rock ballad that got way too much radio overplay. A DJ friend said he got so tired of the constant repeated call in requests from teen aged girls. Still its a good ballad that carries memories.
1	Josh Ritter introduced me to this song during his trip this year through Minneapolis. While not the first song of his set, it was the first song of his I hadn't yet heard. The stage lights dimmed, shadowing the band. The electronics exited First Avenue's cavernous big room. Ritter's voice, in its natural form, filled the cavities of that floor. I looked around and saw lonely men, happy couples, giddy college boys and girls, bellowing along with this anthem to the vast night sky, and I was hooked. I could help but smile at the connection he'd established between himself and the crowd - between his voice and my heart. It's the moment I most remember from that show and subsequently it triggered by purchase of the single as sold on Amazon. The studio version of this song contains the same expansive resonate qualities of the live performance. Ritter's voice connects and demands an attentive listen - not background noise. However, this song's natural place is live. In the studio, the voice gets absorbed by the microphone and the acoustics in the room itself. It feels contained and stifled. It demands air and echo. As a listener you want the words to vibrate into the night and dissipate like smoke which carries its essence long beyond its physical appearance wanes. Those looking to engage this beautiful composition might do better purchasing the live version of the song off the "In the Dark: Live at Vicar Street" version. Heck, might be better off just buying the whole live album.
1	Sounds very mediocre and the mix was just horrible. Listened to both on headphones and high end speakers and neither translated well when compared to other top edm producers.
0	5 Stars is not enough! This relation of Welsh bands ("Man", "Ducks Deluxe") came out with some of the most overlooked music of the 70's, going from heavy rock to folk to captivating, jazzy, spacey jams. Definitely "desert island" material. It's that good! As for  the other albums mentioned above, they HAVE been released as a 3fer on the  UK's BGO Records:#BGOCD452. ALL the CD's are still available via the web if  you look. Also look here at Amazon for the 'Man' band's CD "Christmas  at the Patti" which features Help Yourself on 2 songs: A 10 minute  "Mona", and "Eddie Waring" which logs in at 14 minutes.  There is another import CD listed as HY in Amazon, "Walk Away". I  am not familiar with it, but will check to see if it is indeed long lost  material. ... BUY these  CD's. You won't regret it.
0	Matt Braunger has the Nick Swardson genial everyday guy who drinks appeal with the delivery of Dana Gould and the specificity of Patton Oswalt. I am officially a fan after 1 listen. I have a long commute and use stand up sets to get me through it. I saw Soak Up The Night in the $5.00 section and figured I would take a chance on a fellow I had heard on Marc Maron's WTF podcast and Jesse Thorn's The Sound of Young America podcast. He was a good interview that turned out to be a comedian with a sensibility up my alley. He had me going from the start..the pacing was excellent, delivery crisp. His bits Comedian, Bathroom Graffitti and Lifting Weights To the Smiths made me like the direction this was all going - if the whole CD had plateaued with those first three - the purchase would have been justified. But I started silently knee slapping around the time he got to Bed Calzones. Was stifling laughter at the Marble Slab Creamery. Let a chortle escape during Rapper Interview and started plain laughing without care for my fellow bus riders by the time Soak Up The Night crested. BUY THIS NOW
1	It's ok good choice, might b one of those grow on you songs.if your like me some songs when u here them for the first time u might not like it. But! After u here it a few more times u start to Like it. .
0	1: [PT] Fraca, sem bons riffs, nenhum trecho legal em toda a musica. Tem um ritmo semi rapido, mas nao tem nada de bom. Som do baixo  ridiculo. / [EN] Weak song, no good riffs at all. Semi fast but whatever, the song doesn't have anything to offer. Bass sound is pathetic.  2: [PT] Riffs sem graa, refrao apelativo-lamentavel. Semi rapida tb mas novamente, sem sal. Som do baixo continua ridiculo. / [EN] They can't be serious with a song named liked that. Again, bad riffs, terrible lyrics, I just can't believe someone take 6 years to do this. Bass sound still pathetic.  3: [PT] Lenta. Nao  boa mas mas em comparao com as outras duas,  como se fosse uma ANGEL OF DEATH, MASTER OF PUPPETS, THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST ou afins. / [EN] Slow song. This is not exactly a good song but compared to the first 2 songs, this one sounds like ANGEL OF DEATH, MASTER OF PUPPETS or THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST. In other words, the firts 2 songs are really bad. I can't believe this bass sound.  4: [PT] Ah vi, lamentavel a ponto de eu nao conseguir escrever nada. / [EN] This one is so bad, but soooooooo bad, I can't even describe. Congratulations Manowar.  5: [PT] Mais ou menos como Born in a Grave. Nada de sensacional, mas no  tao ruim como as outras. Nao vale o album. Outra coisa estranha  q os solos estao muito sem inspirao. Sempre gostei dos solos do Logan, mas sei l o q aconteceu desta vez. / [EN] Again, not as bad as the others but nothing special. Doesn't pay the album. Additionally, I don't know what happened to Logan, but his solos on this albums are very strange. I always liked his solos but not this time. Uninspired.  6: [PT] Meu deus, como este baixo t ruim bixo. Caraca. Desculpa, to sem paciencia, nao consigo mais ouvir esta m****. / [EN] Man.... I'm sorry but I can't take it anymore. Sorry, but I can't listen to this. I have better things to do. This album is a bad joke. 6 years for this? Congratulations again, Manowar.  Man... if you buy this album... good luck! As other guy mentioned, Gods of War sounds like perfect compared to this, and rememeber that GoW has no songs AT ALL, only narrations, ultra slow songs and s*** like that.  ps: right now El Gringo is playing, I gotta go, if I listen to 10 more seconds of this I will kill myself!!!
0	Great music.
0	If you like the song, here is a convenient and portable version of it.  That's all I have to say about that.
1	If you want to hear where Plant is musically these days, take a listen, music of the World with soft, mellow vocals from Plant.  Robert, as a life-long fan, your fans have supported you and your Zep band mates all these years, buying every release, re-release, several greatest hits, and even shedding proud tears of nostalgic joy with warmed hearts at the few reunion shows Zep has performed.  It's now time for pay back and showing us the appreciation we deserve!  Follow AC/DC's lead, create a new explosively hard rock/metal album with Jimmy, John Paul and Jason, then do a World Tour (with a 3 night stop in Houston-yes every show will be sold out) and give us what we want and my 3 boys in their 20's, need and will cherish until we die!
1	The least inspiring chant album I have heard; slow, plodding and sometimes musically strained in key. Lacking in spiritual bouyancy.
0	If you like the movie you'll love the sound track! It's Acca-AWESOME!
1	This singer, and CD, were recommended to me. But it was very disappointing. I will not be ordering any more by her.
1	I could not download this.  I tried multiple times and reading all of the help info did not help!  Very disappointed
1	It sounds nice. I like the rhyme and lyric. For the money it sells it's a perfect piece of music.
1	Remember a few years back when Len covered Earth Wind and Fire's "That's the Way of the World" except switched the lyrics to "It Ain't Over Til It's Over?"  Well, the kid wudn't lyin'!  Evidently, the market for vapid wanna-rock still runs on all cylinders, God love this country, because he's stolen from the best so why not the rest.  Have a party during which you and your friends scratch your whiteboy rasta dreds for lice trying to figure out Lenny's original source.  Only problem is, this game can only last as long as an Amazon music sampler.  Oh, well, fill up the rest of the time with "Jeffersons" reruns.  Mama said!
1	Great song,
1	I never received this CD so I just don't know how to review it...I met Randy in Santa Monica a few years prior to his untimely passing.  He was very gracious and kind enough to give me a guitar pick!  We were fishing off the pier...
1	I know 'It's Five O'clock Somewhere' is a good song because I've heard it done well at many square dances.  But I was very disappointed with this version.  I know a local square dance caller who does it much, much better.
0	This song is bad@$$.  It is one of the few country songs that are good.
1	Good stuff.
0	Love this song!!!
1	Good melody, lyrics, vocals. The chord progression is memorable and a little different.
0	Don't like it could I get my money back I didn't mean to to order it  I ment to just review it first
1	Love good music & downloading single mp3 I can get the songs I want & it is easy to download.
0	The Altars of our Heart is where God communes in this song!
0	good stuff
0	I bought this CD without hearing it first, as I'm a heavy Kiss fan.  The music is lite to rock middle of the road. Especially when comparing it to the music of Kiss.  Th lyrics are bland not and very catchy, all in all, it's an average effort.  I really expected a lot more from the rock legend Paul Stanley.  I think two stars is also a bit generous it's more like 1.5 stars and certainly won't win any awards.
0	Really find this to be a bad song trying to desperately to be the overplayed summer song of the season and it's just not really that good.
1	While the L.M. on the Moulin Rouge album was very good, the lyrics were different from the original pop chart topper.  Loved this one best.
1	There is so much emotion in this group. Music is an avenue for our emotions to be fed and let free. I have found that there are moments in life when my 'Hunger' needs some Fireflight :)
1	Oh.  My.  God.  How anyone could like themselves so much, rap about nothing except how he got shot, and expect to be ill is beyond me.  To the reviewer with the weird transcript, as much as I hate 50, he isn't a canibal.  I mean, seriously, they don't eat people.  You must be so stupid you mistook the word "Canibus".  Avoid this crap.
1	Great song!
1	I was looking for a graceful version of the Black Hawk Waltz. This is very twangy with accordians. It was not what I was looking for. A cute version, but not graceful. The audio was very clear.
1	Perfect for foxtrot dancers.
0	A great song. What more can I say?
1	I've repeatedly tried downloading the mp3 only to play through my iTunes player, but the download keeps failing. I haven't figured out the problem yet.
1	Love it........
1	I don't think I'd love this song as much as I do if I never saw casting out preform live. They're a band filled with great down to earth personalities and are positively at one with their fans. The lead singer Nathan especially has eccentric behavior (in a good way) when doing a show (to say the least) anyone would love them live. that being said this is the only song of theirs I reaaally like. Go figure. But purchase quixote! :D
1	Super great song from one of the most versatile artists of my generation.  What more can I say other than it's the best!!
0	Never got it to listen to. Got charged but no joy
1	I truly appreciate his uncompromising approach to his music, doing what he wants with it and creating a sound that is uniquely his. Delirious is a great dance tune as well as one you can sing along with. I like that and I think you will, too.
0	So encouraging!  Thank you Hillsong United!!!  When I need a bit of encouragement on a hard day this song helps me refocus and look above the waves!
1	The gospel song there is out there if u looking a way to get your praise this is it for sure.
1	Not sure what to say except this was great and well made and exactly what i wanted.  Loved th item, with quick delivery and payment
0	A classic!
0	This is such an uplifting song...you can't listen to it and feel anything but good by the end.  It brings to mind so many memories of people that have special places in my heart.
1	Good tune
0	Title sums it up. Got it as a free download and yet I still feel ripped off.
1	Excellent
0	There's not one song I don't love by this artist.  Eminem is the realist and brings out lyrics that strike a chord with each of us.  His talent and stories are interesting, true and filled with every emotion you can reflect.  He is phenomonal and I will continue to buy whatever songs he sings.  THis song is particularly my favorite because we forget sometimes that what people tell us about who we are isn't always true.  Who doesnt need that validation from time to time?
1	Good song
1	Her voice isn't the problem but the arrangement is boring with harsh repetive lines. I would like to hear her sing this song with the help of a different backup band, arranger and composer.
1	love it
0	I recently started listening to her music and she has a amazing voice. This is song is worth checking out great lyrics
0	I am new to Chakra Meditation and stumbled across this music while doing some research on the internet.  I have to say this music is so uplifting.  I can listen at work when I do not have time to meditate and obtain that feeling of oneness.  If sounds were light, this would be the purest form of light.  As I progress and become comfortable in my pursuits for energy meditation and become more comfortable with the law of one I will be getting more from this  artist.  She eminates beauty from within and I look forward to hearing more...
1	This was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. Each member needs to go but a stomp. This band has the musical talent of a piss ant.
1	Great ending to a great flik
0	I grew up listening to blue grass music as my parents were from kentucky and tennesee ..... it is really sad to me that young people miss out on great music,,, especially gospel
0	Great Album!!! His best one since Rewind! Flame really out did himself with this one!!! I love the Royal Flush theme in almost every song!
1	The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.
1	awesome product i like it!
0	I didn't think there was away to make these songs worse. Apparently there is.
0	Love it!
1	delicate convicting soulful
1	Awesome artist and song  that hits close to the heart.
1	what can i say his style is his own, his lyrics are on point an hes just differnt. the albums pretty good from start to finish.  fav tracks: ronald regan era blow my high high power adhd po mans dreams
1	Great
1	The "Lay it Down" track will kick you around the room.  The whole CD is solid with great blues work and some very tasty vocals.  Some songs have a definite country feel but in all it is a great CD.
0	oldie but goodie. this is a favorite of mine. oldie but goodie. this is a favorite of mine. buy this one
1	I am a long time Celtic thunder fan, but I must admit this was not their best album.  The music is slow and not interesting.  There isn't many upbeat, happy songs.
0	I ordered two songs from this album and both have skips, like the digital tracks were ripped from a scratched up CD. You can hear some of it on the samples. It wasn't apparent in mine, but it does show up later in the tracks.
1	God sucks
0	It arrived damaged
1	Wait on the Lord...again I say, wait! Commission is stil the the best. Always on the lookout for Commissions reunions.
0	Horrible covers of classic rock by hipster bands.  Just couldn't take it any longer.  Make syou want to drive a spike through your brain.  Please, Amazon, do everyone a favor and get rid of this disaster.
0	Some really beautiful music but the volume is horribly inconsistent. There doesn't seem to be a theme to the music other than songs from India. That is a very broad spectrum. One song is actually a love song.
1	Outstanding. ..guess we all have a perfect storm
1	Product sucked got it and it skips very badly to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it was just as bad and warped very bad.
1	Wrong Item
0	I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music
0	Amazing covers Amazing Voice.
1	Lovely voice - familiar, welcome, haunting, beautiful.
1	The songs is nothing you never hear from New Kids On The Block got a great beat and it is good dance song
0	Simple a wonderful collection of well produced rock. You'll listen to it over and over.
1	My son's teacher has a version that is longer than this one that I like better.
1	Wonderful piece of music, horribly recorded.  Like listening through a tin can.
0	Its Prince
0	This is an absolutely amazing album!  Do yourself a huge favor and get to know The Dirty Guv'nahs because they rock!!
1	I love this song so much. It is awesome as is Bruno Mars. I would love to get the chance to see him in concert.
1	Very disappointing to me. Horrible quality and so much static. I have never experienced anything bad with Amazon til now.
1	A great album - remastered for today - get it at a good price and enjoy it!  Five stars...
0	This is a beautiful song that applies to so many people. I love all of the encouraging music available through Amazon. God bless!
0	I recently saw Jeremy Camp in concert. I loved this song. It is one of my favorite Christian songs. I can listen to it over and over!
1	Five Stars for the clear recording and quality sound. All ages would enjoy this classical piece. Used to hear the piece while learning to play.
1	I searched for a "clean" version of this song, and this is what Amazon suggested.  It is not a clean version.
1	Ne-Yo is a pure gentleman with this album and I love it! You definitely have to have an appreciation for this talented young man to come out with an album where you can tell he puts his all into each song. It would've been awesome if there was a download of videos and behind the scenes footage available for sale to come along with the album. I love seeing musicians at work, from the beginning stages, to making their ideas come to life, and the final, finished product. Keep doing you Ne-Yo, and thank you GOD for not being damn near naked in your videos, keeping things light & fun, and not constantly talking about what can be done in bed.
1	I love Ed Sheeran, but the music on these is subpar
1	So, so.
0	Didn't like the vegas version. I bought another version by someone else.
0	Katy Perry.  She can sing, she has a killer bod and I wish I had the same bod!  LOL!!  My daughter likes her stuff also but, some of it she really can't listen too-she's slightly too young yet.
1	I will have to try to clean OR upgrade the record somehow.  The information on the condition of the "record" was not accurate.  In my collection process I would rate the "Record" as a C-  (I would not have purchased it had I seen it in person).
1	I have been playing Don Moen's CD in my car every day since I received it. He is a gifted musician with a profound love for God and it shines through in every single song.  I sing along and worship along with him and it blesses me tremendously.  It is timeless and never fails to bring me into the presence of God.
0	Took a chance, never listened to them. Really liked the sound, many songs have similar sounds, but still liked their flavor. Was surprised that I liked almost every track.
1	Likin' it!
1	Love this song!
1	This version is not what you would expect.  I am sorry I purchased it.  Stick with the Verge.  If you order this item, get a refund.
0	You could loop their entire catalog into one song and i wouldn't know the difference. This is the by product when your music is made for the sole purpose of being played on mainstream radio.
1	I'd always loved the Tamlins rockers version of this track.  And a Sly and Robbie dub version.  Thanks to Questlove for reminding us of this incredible version that tells a touching tle of urban decline backed with just flawless funky musicianship.
1	okay where do i begin, i mean if your gonna have little avrils running around trying to get the youths money for the big time music companies at least make sure they can sing in the first place. I thought Avril was bad enough and it just couldn't get any worse but alas again I was worng. Fefe 's first song she came out with Bye bye boyfriend was the most pathectic song ever written her voice is whiny and obnoxius and she makes a sad attempt of trying to fit into fast growing  trends in the media. I mean shes quite the rebel with her hardcore exterior and pop princess voice to add on to it . To sum it all up I suggest you spend your money on something more interesting and unique like collecting stamps.
0	I had a hard time trying to get CD and I do like it alot.  Yes, I would recommend this site.  Thank you
1	I keep trying to force myself to like it cause i want to but i just cant, they have changed to a positive pop rock feel now and i don't get it or like it. The songs are all to poppy and upbeat and radio friendly they sound now like cold play with a touch of southern rock and pop grunge. The album as a whole id describe as generic radio friendly pop rock  or soft rock.
1	Really??? Love the song selection, musically really good, vocals just kill the whole thing! What a tool DLR is...complete tool.
1	This is my first wiz album. I decided to give it a shot. Now I remember why I never cared to listen to this cat. This album is pure arse. Lyrics are 9th grade level at best. He used every rap style that is used by all the other lame rappers out now. Sometime I wonder how people get album deals. But I cant be too mad, what can I expect from a dude who marries a video hor<<<<<<oooooppps
1	I downloaded the mp3 albumn based on the hearing this classic singer's Christmas music as a child.  Unfortunately, I can't listen to this music unless I turn the volume on my computer up to the maximum and it is still very soft.  I definitely can't add it to a playlist with other music.  So disappointed as Leontyne is an amazing singer.
1	Very smooth sensual sound! Seen him in concert and was blown away by the style if the band. Enjoyed the performance tremendously.
1	This album is amazing. These women are so talented, along with the rest of the band. The tracks/lyrics are all so diverse, and the album is something you can listen to over and over again. If you are considering purchasing this, quit reading the reviews and go for it!
1	Copy cats
0	This album is trash, this band completely copies and tries to be GUNS N ROSES of the 1985-1989 era with the leather, boots and aviators. The lead singer of faster pussy in one video tries to be AXL in "jungle" with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelets and leather pants. Dont buy this imposter junk, go get Appetite for Destruction by Gn'R and rock out. No one can ever be AXL. The songs try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [being bad]. Also the lyrics try to be like brett michaels of poison and [are awful]. Rock on
1	I was extremely disappointed with this item. As some other reviewers mentioned there are no words/lyrics. Where is the g in cd+g? If zero stars was offered I would have chosen that as the rating. Totally false advertising! Amazon please deal with this!
1	Music did NOT download!!! Could not find help with this topic!!!!!
1	Wrong song. Supposed to be Wrecking Ball by Miley Cyrus so just be careful when purchase songs.
1	Apparently this song is attached or coded to the Prime Digital services. I made two calls to Amazon to fix the problem as when I purchased the song I should be able to download it to my device. This must be to difficult of a task to correct and I was advised that it is somehow showing for Prime only, however will gladly accept your full purchase amount. So what are you paying for?? I'm hoping for a refund, because when you purchase a song it should be yours to download, not just in a cloud when your online!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sam-Smith/dp/B0013ETJJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sam Smith</a>
1	great song and memories.
0	I think the song is pretty cool.  Interesting beat.  I like here voice,  raspy smooth, funky mellow. Overall great song!
1	this c.d. is okay. (although not as good as it could be) i really enjoy listining to it. It has a very catchy sound, and should be sold. i do not believe it is worth it's price. the price needs to be lowered. i mean, it's okay, but not THAT good. so over all, don't buy it. (unless you like getting ripped off)peace out!
1	I stumble across Taylor Davis on YouTube a few years ago. Not knowing who she was then I really enjoyed hearing her play. This is a great album and I enjoy listening to every song on the album. Usually when I purchase an album I usually only like a select few songs. She did a great job on this.
0	the first song, superconductor is the best song on this cd. prince should do a whole cd for her like this song.  the rest of her cds, nothing to remember. give the next cd a real prince feel. if not, you won't hear much more from this artist. only prince can save this girl. can we get a andy 6 cd?
0	The tidal says it all.
0	I had expected more than I received by this CD, something to listen to clear my mind after a hard days work.  Just didn't like most of the songs.
1	ok
1	Quite contemplative guitar playing that stimulates repetitive brain alpha waves - so necessary for sound REM sleep and meditative relaxed mode. Good job man!
1	Good song
1	I've always loved Monty Python (hey, who doesn't?), and when I read on an article in Wikipedia about bizarre records that the group had released a... well, a bizarre LP back in 1975, I knew I had to get my hands on it. I'll tell you what's different about it in a moment, but I'll mark it as a SPOILER ALERT below, in case you don't want to know and prefer to go rifling through crates of old records at a flea market and find out for yourself instead. In that case, you should also avoid the Wikipedia articles about LP records.  This is the original pressing, released in 1975. The record (according to the liner notes, a free LP to accompany a matching tie & handkerchief set) is freaky in several ways. The cut-out sleeve mimics a box with a tie & handkerchief inside; it's labeled as a "free record" and it has two Sides 2, no Side 1 - the only way to tell them apart is a tiny code which ends in A on one side and B on the other. And the B side... surpriiise! *SPOILER ALERT* ...actually contains... you ready for this? It contains two separate grooves, each one with a different set of sketches. Which means that depending on where you place the needle, you'll randomly hear one groove or the other (It also means that the side has to be perfect - if it skips ahead or back anywhere, it'll continue on the wrong groove. Thank goodness my copy is, and I have to be grateful to the excellent seller, coolgrrl28, for that). *END OF SPOILER* I can only imagine how many buyers scratched their heads because of that, back in the Seventies, when there was no Internet to give away secrets like that. The comedy skits are very funny and well done, with excellent use of stereo ambience and sound effects. I'm told that newer pressings of this album (and CDs, of course) do not have the B-side gimmick... which is why I consider myself very lucky to have laid my hands on this original, perfect, rare, collectible first-press LP. I love it!!!
1	Listen to the samples before downloading this. Yes, the price is good at $6.99. This is obviously taken from a vinyl source as is evidenced by some popping from a not-mint LP. Either seek out the original LP or the import CD of this.
1	Great album; slow songs..
0	I like it!
1	This album combines artistry with creativity. Love the cohesive theme married with the variety that each song brings.
1	Gospel fans won't find hype and fluff here, but a get-down, tear up the church choir celebration!  Arrangements and production are tasty. Most tracks have a Contemporary feel, with Ricky leading his troops. Some feature other singers; a couple range into Jazz/Pop territory. I liked nearly every song, so am getting the whole album.  Look for this to win some Stellar Awards!
1	This album was given to me as a Christmas present. I love The Neighbourhood, I heard 'Sweater Weather' around the time it released and I really liked the song but because I was a prune of a music critic I didn't give any of their songs a chance because at the time I only liked pop music, and anything cheerful and bubbly. My taste changed this year real drastically, I remember watching The Originals and hearing 'Let it go' and when I heard that song I was desperately searching to find it, so I literally typed in every lyric I could remember from my scatter-brain. And when I did find it I suddenly realized ''Hey this is the same band that made Sweater Weather?!'' So from that moment on I was hooked! And I never really loved a band as dearly as I do TNBHD. The lead singers voice is incredible! And the sounds and beats of both Wiped Out and I Love You are to die for!  I'm really torn from deciding which of the two albums I like more but I think I Love You is just a tiny bit more special, I really love this album a lot too! Wiped Out is more relaxing and peaceful, and I Love You really hit me hard, I felt like it was more relatable. I'm really interested to see what else The Neighbourhood will come out with in the future!
1	Are we in Junior High? If your old then 13 years old, you will realize that this is one terrible band. Trey's vocals are terrible, he comes close to mumbling alot of the time. The songs are plain and really simple. Stay far away from this or good like trying to give this cd away. The day the music died is when Everyday Sunday became a band.
1	What makes this a superior collection is the inclusion of the rare medley of "The Worst That Could Happen" and "Wedding Bell Blues". You cannot find it anywhere else. It was originally released on their first greatest hits when it was released on vinyl and hasn't been released on cd.
1	Look, we've all enjoyed getting a bit ripped off from the Stones all these years. Here is all the compilation you need:  High Tide Green Grass (2 songs only available here)/Through the Past Darkly (2 songs only available here)/Sucking in the 70s (3 songs only available here)/ Step Back (OK, you have all these, but it's a really good compilation and liner notes)/ Made in the Shade (they released this and Sucking in the cardboard sleeves like the London/Decca collection, so it fits in with the others) Made in the Shade  is the lamest compilation and cover ever but it's so bad, you gotta have it).  The really frightening thing about this is that the London/Decca tracks are on the Universal label here. Good god. Look, those tracks have been perfected. You can only perfect music. After that you can only alter it. Whatever it is, it will only get worse....Who can edit a 3 minute song? That's the future on the Stones catalog, I guess....  Also there is enough new material on this, Charlie Darling CD, and the Ya Yas box to have issued a great Rarities II. But noooo...  And why only use the IBC tracks from the Bright Lights bootleg, when we know the Chicago tracks exist in both mono and stereo mixes.  Also one of the reviewers has reported that he got 2 defective disks in the 5 disk set. This is a higher than average rate of defective CDs. I responded with a comment see: "Nice packaging but 2 damaged cd's!!!," If you get defective CDs, please report it in your review or your dealer.  Defective CDs tend to come in successive runs. I know for a fact the Universal label has a higher than average defect-rate.  Now, as far as what Grrr means? Go look in Ed Sanders book Fug You on page 38. Grrr is mentioned again on page 100-something....(see if you can figure this out first: HINT: ...."But who pulls whose chain? Who knows? "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive.".....
1	Ramsey Lewis is a treasure.  This popular song signaled a foray into smooth jazz.
1	I have this on an LP record and finally found it here. The entire collection is great fun with the "monsters" singing their own songs.
1	Barbra sings betta than evah here...and her duet with Jason, her son, is so heartfelt that i was practically in tears.  Well-worth buying--you won't be disappointed.
0	'Hilarious', 'Incisive', 'Cutting-Edge', are all words to describe other comedians. 'Pointless' is the only adjective you need to describe Joe's comedy. I was bored so I thought I'd listen to this, after listening, however, I was actually more bored. It seems, via comedy, Joe has inadvertently broken the laws of cause and effect, he's discovered 'anti-comedy', which is a little bit worrying as, I assume, if he comes into contact with a proper comedian, the resulting explosion with be cataclysmic.
1	I like the card because it is easy to read the numbers on it. Also they give you your credit score with every payment. And a 18 months 0% interest rate works good for me. What the rules are for purchasing as far as interest rate I am not quite sure of Didn't take the time to read it.
1	She's back, and Jennifer Lopez can't even stand on her own.  She's using a rapper, pro-tooling devices for her voice and using American Idol as a platform to promote her music career, which I think is conniving and sad.  They paid her to judge contestants for their vocal talent when she knows full well she will be lips-syncing "On The Floor".  She even took the concept of this song from Kat Deluna without her permission.  She's a 41 year old woman that has made a song that caters to teenagers, and she's showing no growth, or maturity, and when its time for her to perform this song live, we will see the same typical lip-syncing.
1	Not what I had hoped for.
0	Got it today,listened to a great album.what can I say,I will always be a Pink Floyd fan.
1	When Lucinda truly sinks her teeth into a song there are none better.  And there are two or three cuts on this latest effort in which she revels in her "Lucindaness".  On the other hand, she seems to just go through the motions at times and there are examples of that on this CD also.  But the production quality is superb and the guitar work by Doug Pettibone and Bill Frisell is worthy of William's vocals and then some.
1	This is a short edit, with the middle third (the best part) missing.  I want my money back.
1	I don't know what to put here....except that if you have a sound system that is really crisp with no artificial inflation of the bass, ramp this up and you'll just feel...inspired and filled with awe.
0	1 great song, one ok song. Now 53 had the great song. waste of money
0	one of the greatest blues acoustic guitarist and 1 of the greatest blues voices to stick boy sees much to shout about here get your hands clapping and your feet a tappin' gotta have it
1	The album is good. You can tell that the guys didn't rehearse their parts as much as usual. The women were superb on every cut. I loved Pontoon.... Can't help that. There is a really pretty one that is haunting... Night Owl. The others were certainly easy to enjoy. Those two were my favorites.
0	love  her music.
1	What a wonderful reminder of the strength that is in Him by our side.  Terrific song with The Old Paths group delivering it in a powerful way.
0	Lady Gaga just keeps on going! This song is so deep and nothing like other shallow pop songs. There is an actual meaning behind it. It is good to see at least someone in today's mass media has a mind of her own and is willing to risk her career and money for her fans. The ways she risks it is by shocking almost everyone with her insane fashion choices and retro sounds. It's like I am a teenager again when I hear this! I blast it in my car when I go to pick up my kids from school and they love it too! 5 stars.
0	My interest in Speed Racer has been reignited with the release of the movie.  My six year old son and I have watched the cartoons and went to see the film, and when I saw this I thought that I would give it a try.  I had thought that maybe it was an extended mix of the theme song, or that it would have some incidental music from the TV series.  With the running time being over nine minutes I thought that for sure there was a bargain to be found here.  I was wrong.  The theme song is here as well as an instrumental version, but together they take about two and a half minutes.  The rest of the time is dead air.  I went through it to make sure that I didn't miss anything, but nope...just silence.  Save yourself ninety-nine cents and don't buy it.
1	Buying this mp3 single from the Amazon music store was quick and painless.  Price is on par with the iTunes music store.  Once I had downloaded the track it imported into my iTunes library with no additional steps.  The quality is great.  What a great way to get a quick shot of Roy !
1	I've been so used to itune, didn't expect this to be easy purchase and usage!
0	Love the song but the quality is poor.
1	Not sure if this is Amazon's fault or Import CDs.  After doing a search on Amazon for "Alana Grace" this CD came up.  I ordered it thinking I would receive the Alana Grace CD, but instead received this CD which is by another group named NFD who, unknown to me, has a CD with the same title as the Alana Grace CD.  The NFD CD is only three songs and other than the title has nothing in common with the CD I was expecting.  Import CD did do a good job of shipping this very promptly.  Hopefully Amazon will improve its searches and not let this kind of thing happen again.  Definitely disappointed.
1	Only got this for a friend.
0	This CD was the last of the Wave Aid Collection that I did not have.  The price was very reasonable and the CD was shipped promptly.
0	Timeless classic never get tired of these hits
1	Absolutely stunning album. Has really put her on the map and made her a household name in the darker music circles.
1	This album is a joke..2 good tracks and the rest are filled with R and B artists and new school rappers that no one cares about..Justus on 4 tracks !? Anderson Paak on half the album ?! Come on..Dre raps fast on every track trying too hard to emulate K Dot..Ice Cube , Cold187 and Snoop aren't themselves and are wasted by Dre's new direction. There is waaay too much yelling on here also , not too mention the production that Dre barely touched (he co produced 2 tracks only ) Dre , why did u not just give us what we have waited for ? We want YOUR fat beats..even u don't feel comfortable spitting gangster lyrics , have 20 of your friends do it..What a waste !!
1	You may recognize this song from the commercials or trailers of The Nine Lives of Chloe King. This is an ABC Family television show. I really enjoy the haunting sound of Katy's voice in this particular song.  If you are looking for something similar try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Familiar-Taste-Of-Poison/dp/B0026P5TBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Familiar Taste Of Poison</a>&nbsp;by Halestorm. Note - Most of Halestorm's music is not similar to this song. And in fact, the short sample snippet will not convince you. Maybe swing over to Youtube and give that song a listen. My guess is if you downloaded E.T. by Katy Perry, you will like A Familiar Taste of Poison.
1	no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no please. It was just a terrible song.
1	Poor music
0	All the other reviewers have said all that needs to be said. This is Queensryche as they should be, should sound. Lovin' it!
1	Actually, I love it but I can't download it to actually hear it!!! Hey Amazon, please fix your download tool.
0	Came with only one cd. Hate being deceived.
1	Big guitar fan. Huge fan of Warren's work but this album is almost awful. Warren's guitar playing is on a whole other level but there are no songs. My biggest gripe with Warren has always been his lack of song writing ability. He has never been able to decide where he wants to go- jam band, heavy rock, classic rock, blues, southern, jazz...... I find the songs on this album are very linear and almost mundane. Listening to it has me feeling like I am in a humid cabin in upstate NY on a rainy day, no modern conveniences and I am just itching to get out of there.  Warren is best when he sticks to the 4-5 minute song verse, chorus, verse and a ripping solo.
0	I LOVE my new CD, the harmony is stellar, the song choices fun!!!  'If this don't light your spiritual fire-then your wood is wet!!'
0	If you're looking for something to help you sleep, this is not it. The 30 second preview here sounds peaceful (and almost hypnotic to me) but the full version has some strange elements. As the other reviewer said, it does have a lot of static. It sounds like...popping noises, or something to that effect. Very strange.
1	Love this guy. He's awesome.
1	I am a fan of a lot of their songs.  This song...just hits me in the right spot.  How can you go wrong with a title like that?
1	This short praise song fits in so well with this classic hymn.it is is beautiful and moving arrangement. I love it.
1	Wow.... This is pretty horrible even for me, and I liked the Atlanta housewives "tardy for the party" single... Don't quit your day job, Tiffany.
0	Great song haven't heard it in year's!
1	I was reading a review in Elle magazine. So I decide to check her out on youtube. I like her singing. I think you will also.
1	We were given a set of CDs from Sunny Day studios and absolutely loved them.  I thought I was safe ordering these to supplement what we already had.  For some reason, these CDs don't even sound like they were done by the same people!  I found these CDs to be very mediocre compared to the other Sunny Day studio CDs that we have.  The voices were not as good and the arrangements were boring.  This purchase was very disappointing.
0	Zero. Can't get it to play without amazon music.  I can't just purchase the song and play it? Rediculous
0	It takes a full minute of silence before the music starts
1	Love this song.  Toby does it again.  He is a wonderful artist.
1	Soaring!
0	When I read that the songs had been remastered for this album, I was encouraged. SSFFTV was a poorly produced album, but the raw energy of the band and the catchy punk tunes more than made up for the deficiencies in the production booth.  This release has tweaked the songs, but I actually like them less than on the original album.  The original is worth getting though- Succulent Space Food for Teething Vampires.
1	I got this because its supposed to be a classic but this book is so out dated it loses a lot of credibility.  Many of the examples or stories drag on waaaaaay to long.
1	Beautiful song!!! Absolutely love it!
1	I love this song.  I have to listen to Christmas Music at work from Thanksgiving to New Years.  A girl can only hear so many Dean Martin and Bing Crosby tunes before she wants to rip her eyes out.  This song breaks up the monotony but not really for the kiddies
1	I LOVE Gary Stewart and this item was an excellent compilation of his greatest hits.  Service was timely and item arrived in great condition.
1	I really liked the price for this collection but was disappointment that so many were in another language. I enjoy listening to choirs and instrumentals and even some of the songs that I know but are in another language but when they repeat songs that are in another language, I'm not even sure it is a Holiday song.
1	It came on time cd came in undamaged. Is a great album
0	great as advertsed come o now its Ludvig! Love listening t\to to fall asleep for a nap or at bed time
1	Good song
1	The movie, "The Great Race", has been my very favorite ever since the first time I saw it as a child.  In fact everytime it would appear on TV on a late night movie channel, I'd stay up and watch it.  So I lately took time to try and find some of the music from the movie, and found several interpretations of the "Pie in the Face Polka".  After listening to samples of each, I went back and chose James Galway's.  His magical flute perfectly reflects the action that happens on the screen during this most hilarious scene.  If you're looking to bring back a wonderful memory from a great movie, I'd recommend James Galway's version of this song!
0	I grew  up listening to Night Ranger and other, similar bands, this is still my favorite jam though!!!  this is the best jam ever!!!
1	I knew Jason Raize personally before he passed away.  He was an old friend from my childhood.  This song is not only beautiful and haunting, but almost ironic in its lyrics... "You promised you'd be there Whenever I needed you Whenever I call your name You're not anywhere"  In my opinion, the best song from the show.  It is one of my favorites on my MP3 player.
1	This is a great song, performed very well by Gregg. It takes me back to 1986. The MP3 sound is acceptable.
0	great song from the 80's. Play it often.
0	The first and only album I haven't liked from Floyd since Final Cut
1	I gave this download only one star because, even though it did download into iTunes on my p.c., I could not get it to sync into my mp3 player as I did with two other songs I purchased from Amazon.com:  'I Can Only Imagine' by MercyMe, and 'All of Creation', also by MercyMe.  If your tech support team can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.
1	Very disappointed in this CD. I used to be one of her biggest fans but on this recording she seems to be singing through her nose a lot. Also, her vibrato is way to fast at times. Difficult to listen to.
1	Craig nails one of the essential tragic flaws in our consumerist society.  People talk about songs being "anthems"... well, "Stuff" doesn't pyrotechnically explode and catchy-hook its way into mass consciousness but it gets right to the heart of what's ailing us collectively.  And, here it is, available on Amazon, the citadel of all things stuff.  Well worth your purchase.
0	I prefer the version on the African Marketplace album by Dollar Brand. Ubu Suku is one of my favorite Abdullah Ibrahim tunes. He is one of the worlds greatest pianists.
0	I love the band and CD and glad to get it  at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend it.
0	I love this song!!  I listen to it over and over again!
0	I thought this CD was boring, and the explicit language is a turn off.
0	Ronald Jenkees is a very talented musician, I would give it a full 5 stars, but good lord the rap tracks on here are deplorable. His rap voice is reminiscent of being hit over the head with a golf club. If it's cheaper to buy the songs individually without the raps, then I recommend doing that exactly.
1	I was 18 when this album came out and I wore out 3 copies of it! Thank goodness for MP3s now.  :-)
0	Great
1	great
1	garbage
1	Good thing this song and the others I downloaded were free. They don't tell you that if you don't click Amazon Downloader immediately after purchasing a song, the download expires and you don't get the song. The one song that did download, is invisible to iTunes anyway. So that free MP3 $5 bonus actually was just a disappointment. I wanted to give it a rating of no stars, but that is not a choice.
0	"Azkaban" is simply wonderful.  John Williams has quite the handle on Harry and his pals on this album.  It moves the movie along at a nice pace and perfectly sets the mood for each part of the film.  From the exhiliration of "Buckbeak's Flight" to the sheer terror of any of the scenes involving the Dementors, Williams sets the tone exactly as it needs to be.  Personal favorites include "Lumos!" and "Quidditch, Third Year."  The entire album is fun to listen to, and it actually works wonders as mood music when you're reading the books these wonderful films are based on.  Highly recommended to any fan of Potter and especiall fans of the "Azkaban" flick.
1	I was a late comer (last summer) to "All Hour Cymbals" but I love that album and was really looking forward to this one.  I have been desperately trying to like it since Tuesday and I have to be honest: this is nothing like the previous album and a huge disappointment.  There are some catchy songs, but I cannot name one that comes close to having the staying power of nearly every song from the previous album.  Worse still, I find about half the album just bad.  I have no doubt it will appeal to a broader audience as much of it is probably pretty danceable and hummable, but it does not capture the subtle almost Sung Tongish grace of much of previous album.  While "Cymbals" was reserved, subtle, catchy and beautiful, this is up front, in your face and sounds like it was produced for Top 40 radio play (I say that more in feeling rather than as a general judgment of the bands purpose).  I know musicians progress and often that progression leaves us yearning for the old while we learn to appreciate the nuances of the new, but in this case Yeasayer has progressed in a direction that I just cant get into.
1	Yuck
0	very strange
1	What guitar player didn't listen to this and imagine themselves standing in the spotlight, being the envy of everyone watching. You had to be exceptional anyway to work with Edgar Winter who convinced Ronnie to do this tune. It's one of those songs that guaranteed you got the girl if you could pull it off live.
0	Have a difficult time burning the song a cd on my pc along with other songs, will have to purchase the movie.
0	As a rabid Grobanite of ten years, I was REALLY excited for this album. Every time Josh goes into an experimental direction, I LOVE it, and in the past, the songs he wrote have always turned out to be my favorites.  To say this album was a disappointment would be an understatement. The lyrics literally made me HOWL with laughter. To be honest, the first time I listened to the album, I was totally confused. I thought, am I listening to the right album?  And then it clicked. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!  There was this one night, Josh was sitting in his new Manhattan penthouse, bored out of his mind, playing around making amateur recordings on garageband. He realized he only had ONE CD-R left, and he couldn't decide if he wanted to record a love letter to Paul Simon, or an audition mix tape to send to Webber and Sondheim and the like... so he compromised and squeezed them both onto one disk. Then his new manager called demanding new material. In his pot brownie induced stupor, Josh accidentally put the wrong disk in the envelope. The actual album he was working on, the amazing album that he's been slaving over for four years is in Paul Simon and Andrew Lloyd Webber's fan mail bags.  That's basically what it sounds like to me. His broadway audition mixtape smashed together with a love letter to Paul Simon. And that sounds like it could be really cool, except it's totally not.  I'm going to pretend this didn't happen and go back to "Awake."
1	This is one of those rare albums that, in this day and age, have several songs that are appealing.  Bruno Mars has a wonderful voice.  You could just download the songs that you have heard on the radio, but this one is worth the money.
1	Fantastic music
1	Lenny kravitz delivers solid rock and roll, this is by far my favorite track of his, with the driving bass and drums
0	One of my old time favorites. She sings it from the heart!
0	I need to read better I guess took forever to download and the music is very strange. Read, read, read.
0	the best
1	Paid to download, the download disappeared the next day.  Never even got to play it once.
0	i never ordered this
0	Hey there! Hope things are well! I always knew you would do this! Hope to see you on the 17th! - Blues
1	This is one of my all time favorite songs. Even if you are not a country music fan I would recommend this song. Well worth the price of the MP3.
0	Disappointed in the quality of the recordings.  I assume it was early Amy cuts that they published.
1	My favorite song of this past summer! I'd buy tickets to his concert if he was headlining!
0	it was good
1	shabba ranks1!!!!  reminded me CANCUN CLUBS!!  JAMAICA!! GREAT TUNE!!!
0	The good news is that the song selection on this CD truly represents the very best of the 5th Dimension. The bad news is that the beauty of the 5th Dimension's arrangements and harmonies is sadly lost by the inexcusably and horrendously poor sound quality of this CD. The lows are muddy and the highs lack sparkle on this so-called "Ultimate Collection". The intricate arrangements of these songs, which include trumpets, flutes and the rich voice of Marilyn McCoo, cannot truly be appreciated given the poor mastering of these recordings . This CD is released under the Arista and BMG labels.  Considering the size and reputation of these companies -- along with the costly price of this CD -- music buyers deserve better. I downloaded a sample track from the 5th Dimension's "Definitive Collection", off Kazaa. This two-disc CD collection, which was released by Arista back in 1997, has superior sound quality. I'm so disatisfied with this CD that I'm going to order the 5th Dimension's "Definitive Collection". Do yourself a favour and do the same!
0	Excellent single for this particular time! Cant wait til the album drops
1	It kept charging to my account and I had to call Amazon.com. That was VERY IRRITATING. I was not happy with it at all....
0	I have bought a few songs off Amazon.  I don't know what happens, but after about a month or so when I double click on my computer to play it, the computer doesn't know what file it is.  I haven't burned the songs to a CD to see if would still do the same thing.  I really like the song itself, it's just seems to have an expiration.
1	Ah, the joy of a passion.  Mrs Miller and her love of vocal expression makes me smile and play at the top volumne as I drive along.  We all need to remember to do what we love!!!!  Nancilee Wydra
1	I heard this on the radio and thought, good grief I haven't heard this in a minute. So I bought it
1	Very short.
0	It's obvious 50 has some talent, he is a decent lyricist.  The problem is that his image has superceded his talent. All these girls coming on here saying "ooh ooh, 50 is so hot and he's so good at rap" you have no idea what you're talking about. 50 cent is a decent rapper, nothing more.  He is currently hip hop's golden boy because he has something every suburban white kid would die for : Street cred.  And I'm talking real street cred on the ghetto streets, not the wild streets of Iowa City or Bergen County. It's very simple.  The people who LOVE 50 cent are the worst type of rap fans.  Very few hard core hip hop heads who been down from day 1 think he is GREAT.  All the suburban white boys and especially the white girls love 50, that's fine.  But he's a cartoon character to them, not a lyricist.
1	I was expecting more from thisat  CD.  I pre-ordered it.  But, returned it once I listened. Yet, I expected more.  I am a fan of her music.
1	I love Willie nd Merle but this is most dreadful CD I have ever bought.  Merle needs to stop performing and just retire. His voice is gone.  Even Willie doesn't sound good here, the songs are unmemorable.
1	good song didn't realize its a live version.
1	I own five different versions of this song, and this one is the least interesting. Shirley Bassey knocked her version out of the park, so you'd be hard pressed to match that one, but even versions that might seem disposable (like Jimmy Durante's or The Smoking Popes') still possess a lot more heart than Groban's version. Plus, it was an awful decision to double the length of the song by repeating the first verse. The repetition saps all the momentum out of the song, which is one of the song's best features. Not recommended.
0	Item as described.
1	This isn't the whole song.  It's 1:24 which I paid $1.29 for which makes it a little more than 1 cent/second.
1	fun, catchy tune!
1	It's either the worst Dylan album ever , or his most creative . Still not sure which .. I'll keep listening .
0	A blast from the past.it's a blast!
1	The song was cut short at the end did not like that. If I'm paying for a song I want the whole song
1	Facing storms and trials...put this one and just bask in the love and promise of the Lord!  He will never leave you!
0	Waste of Money.  Won't play in library.
0	Duets were boring and Barbara's voice did not sound close to her voice that I fell in love with.
0	The first part was fine but I did not like the chants with the Chakras. They were too loud and the voice I found disturbing. I was beginning to dose off and the abrupt chant woke me up.  Had to turn it off.
1	What I wanted and thought I was getting was the  best of what Stonewall Jackson has already recorded.  What came was "new stereo recodings perfomed by the original artist"  The sound is different.  Instrad of smooth blending notes it sounds like he is just talking in some parts.  Definitely not the same as the original recordings that I hear on the oldies western stations.  If I had not thrown away the shipping containers I would have returned this CD.
0	Not as good as Solar Echoes, it was excellent. But this one is still good.
1	I love him when he sung amazing. He takes music to a level that I didn't even know I liked. He's doing a good job.
0	Heard it on the radio and liked the song. I looked and found it for a great price on Amazon. Couldn't pass it up.
1	I was looking for hymns sung in four part harmony. This collection is beautiful and includes so many songs!  It was just what I was looking for.
0	Joe hasn't learned anything. You never bite the hand that fed you.
0	Brandon Heath has been doing what he's doing for a few years now, and he hasn't lost his oomph yet! I've been a fan basically since the beginning, And I've loved every song I've heard. If you like music, this is a must have!  Score:  Leaving Eden  9.9 Your Love  10.0 The Light in Me  9.8 Only Water  9.0 Stolen  10.0 Might Just Save Your Life  9.3 It's Alright  9.8 It's No good to Be Alone  10.0 Now More Than Ever  10.0 The One  8.9 As Long As I'm Here  9.5  Overall  9.7
1	Great choir work on some of my favorite hymns like Ode to Joy. The person i gifted it to  was very happy with this collection,
1	This file was not listed as the live performance of the song.  That information would have been useful to know before my purchase.
1	Used this song in a video, I made about my family, all in fun. Love the story. Worth the 99 cent.
1	The song makes me feel wonderful,because i have been redeemed!! Thank God!! I Love all the music from them! I'm searching for more of his music to buy!!
0	They are mostly done by cover bands and not very good ones at that. Disappointing.
1	I played this for my history class when we were talking about the Cold War.  From the Civil War to the Cold War, the public perception of warfare changed dramatically, and this song showcases the feelings of the 80s.
1	My husband loved it.
1	A giant "Thank You" to the Bach Guild and Amazon for this, frankly, astounding offer!  More offers like this and I'll have to start shopping Amazon for bigger drives.
0	I Love the Harmonies in this music.  The message to this music is pretty good. Music is easy to listen to.
0	I don't remember this item.
0	He's my favorite
0	Great! Thanks
1	This is a line dance song "superb" hit with all the trimmings.
1	Whoever put Luke Powers in front of a microphone and encouraged him to sing is a BAD PERSON! Each song on this album is worse than the one before with, alas, the same excruciating singing. I feel shamefaced about buying it and intend to relegate it to the darkest recesses of the CD cabinet. Or perhaps throw it away.  WARNING: this is not even a one-star album!
1	A great album for Edgar Winter fans!
0	Sad,  but beautiful song that I remember from the 70's. The group "HOT CHOCOLATE" has been around for a long time.
0	most songs on this album are too similar. I only enjoyed 2 songs. Not the best album I've bought in a while. I do like Sinach, and was quite disappointed with this one.
1	I listen to this track when I go out jogging. It is in my playlist and really gets me going and enduring the trials of the trek
1	While not as consistent as his first album, The Shovel vs. the Howling Bones, I still love this album and have become an instant fan of Lincoln Durham. Can't wait to see him live in a few weeks!
0	This nifty CD would be better if it included "Smooth Sailin' Tonight." Can't imagine WHY that brilliantly breezy love tune was left out. ... Bummer.
1	ok
0	very good condition.....same voice....I loved all the songs....I gave GOD'S GOT MY BACK to a friend.....she loved it also.... GOD'S GOT MY BACK CD is  a must to own...title is GOD'S GOT MY BACK BY DENISE LASALLE.....
1	What has happened to Ricky?
1	I won't be listening to this.  I love Amy Lee and Evanescence, and I knew this wasn't going to be the same thing, but it really isn't something I like at all.  It has a weird electronic sound that is just a little annoying.  I guess maybe it works better as a backdrop to a movie rather than a stand alone album.
1	The chorus is GREAT. The rest of the song is not. Not wanting to trash anyone's writing skills, so I will just say the chorus is great!
1	My kids love this song. They play it non stop on our Amazon echo.
1	I've always loved this song and just heard it the other day and had to have it. I think a lot of people have that one person from their past or even present that they have on their mind that will always be there.
1	Very good and good interpreters
1	Not sure what to write here - an excellent song if you like 3 doors down - I got it with a free download.
1	Prism is much better than Teenage Dream. But the whole album is still NOT for children. There are several songs that are not for children the main one is "Birthday" DO NOT buy this or let your children listen to this! There are some songs that are okay for children but NOT the whole album and definietly NOT the song caleld "Birthday" so if you hear your children listening to this stop it immediately, also do not let them listen to Teenage Dream almost ANY song other than Firework is very sexually explicit! The title track Teenage Dream, California Dreams, ET, Peacock, Last Friday Night are ALL sexually explicit and NO children should listen to those, if you let your children listen to those you are a horrible parent.  Now as for this album there is at least WAY WAY less sexuality...the only major sexual song is Birthday and the lyrics in the other songs are much better, but the major problem with this one is another problem Teenage Dream album had is that it forces way too much high pitched vocals that don't sound good because there's just way too many high pitched vocals in that song...luckily not all songs like are like that...but even the more decent songs are just completely generic and suffer from poor vocals...they're just not AS bad as the others but still not worth listening to. A lot of these songs are clearly influenced by if not directly copying many other songs so the originality is not there, even Roar is highly similar to several other songs including Eye of The Tiger by Survivor, plus the song This Moment copies what made Trapped in The Closet by R. Kelly famous there is no way that similarity was done on accident. Lack of originalty and too many repetitive bad sounding high pitched vocals ruin the majority of the album. Some bad lyrics. Cannot recommend the album has a whole despite the album not being all bad there are some decent [VERY generic] tracks but still not really worth listening to because there is WAY better music out there. This album and the artist themselves is FAKE. This artist never would have had a hit song if it weren't for buying her own radio airtime [confirmed by radio stations] and buying Youtube views [also confirmed by Youtube and VEVO] what ultimately makes these songs just horrible is just the fact of how horrible of a person Katy Perry is. She is a lying, cheating, and backstabbing person who doesn't belong in the music industry. She never would have ever charted if she didn't cheat to chart.
0	This album was a test to Metallica. Could they step out of Mustaine's shadow? Yes, they did. BOY, THEY DID! This album rocks from beginning to end. From the acoustic intro to "fight fire with fire" to the monumental instrumental "The Call of Ktulu. Let us not forget the ballad "Fade to Black and the mesmerizing "Creeping Death"
1	Focus & Finish 2014. I got the Victory. I love the positive energy. I start my exercises with this song.
0	nice song
0	the one I purchased skips in a couple of songs  I would like to purchase another one  hopefully the next one is a little better
0	Anybody that doesn't love this song is NOT a country fan,video pretty cool too
0	Now this song know what it's talking about, sure it's old but it's a classic. I love it anyway.
1	This is very pleasant to listen to. I highly recommend it for anyone who  to relax and get away from their mind thoughts
1	Sounds like an MP3 digital file.
1	Ok, where to begin?  This song was my introduction to the Mountain Goats.  What a remarkable song - catchy chorus, impressive lyrics, wistful, joyful, heartfelt, overall maybe as close to a perfect song as we can get in this life.  Then I discovered that John Darnielle has been recording Mountain Goats songs for over 20 years - remarkable songs about relationships, lost lovers, damaged personalities, tributes to fallen stars, biblical and mythological references, lamentations on human frailties, celebrations  of the human spirit.  If you like this song, I encourage you to listen to the entire Sunset Tree album - there are many more excellent songs on this album.  Then start looking for other Mountain Goats songs (start with Youtube) and albums.  I envy you your journey.
1	If you enjoy singing on par with drunken karaoke bar patrons, this CD is for you!  If not, better alternatives abound...
1	I love the arrangement and will have a good time working with it.  No problem with the download - sounds great.  Thanks.
1	I got tired of this song really quickly. It was good the first few times though. But after a while I regretted paying for it
1	Awesome. Arrived earlier than expected. Thank you.
0	I ordered the cd with music and got the audio book instead. What happened? So annoying!!
0	OK, I admit this is not the same hard shot to the body that Night Visions was, but part of that is because they have established their sound. I know some common complaints about this album is they sound too much like some other bands, but I'm going to stand that comment on its head: When I heard the most recent U@ album, I thought a lot of the tracks were by Imagine Dragons!  Not every track is killer, there are some weak spots, but the good stiff is really good. "I bet My Life" had my attention all the way through; could it have been harder? Yeah, but the feel fits the story. "Shots" is an excellent opening track, but it will probably take heat for the guitar riffs and harmony being very U2-esque . . .  and so what? It is a great track. "The Fall" is uniquely ID and may eventually become my favorite track.  The sound is clean, the beat is good and the lyrics take a while to sink in, but leave some interesting image behind. What keeps this from being truly great is yes, some of the tracks have a similar sound and I would like more differentiation in the group's sound. I am hoping that the next album, and that means I hope there is another album from them, will be more diverse. I feel it in the music, they are almost ready to break out of their comfort zone, but they never quite do with Smoke + Mirrors. Do I feel ripped off? Not in the least. If I could rate this fractionally, it would be just under four stars, maybe three and three-quarters. Still worth while acquiring, but it does not equal their debut.
0	I have all Josh's music and have been a fan for years.  This was disappointing.  Choices were wrong, and his usually strong voice seemed weak to me like he wasn't giving it his all.  I have listened to it a few times and each time went away feeling the same.  I'm not even going to keep this one!  It just wasn't up to his usual standard that I expected.
1	One of the very best adaptations of the star spangled banner I have ever heard.  I usually don't care for adaptations of our patriotic songs but this is an exception.  If you listen to it, I'll bet you agree...
1	I was hoping for something better than this after hearing "Impossible" but this album fell short of my expectations. I was not a fan of her first album either but I thought after much time has passed that she would come out with a better second effort and this one sounds like the first. I could not even listen to the whole album in one sitting because it was painfully bad. I think she has a nice voice but this genre may not be for her. I will not listen to any more of this artists music unfortunately.
1	It's Ozzy... duh.
1	The first and second songs are pretty good, but the rest are pretty mediocre.  My 8 year old daughter (who LOVES Katy Perry) even told me she thought this CD was boring (except for "Roar").  My advice, just buy "Roar" and not the whole album.
0	I bought this with my dollar credit. Glad I didn't pay real money for it because it runs out suddenly about four fifths of the way through. Checked on the site and that's the published length, so something has gone horribly wrong early on in the process.
0	As excited as Garcia was in '79 about the first appearance of Mydland simultaneously replacing Keith (keyboards) and Donna (vocals), I never thought that he fit well in the band. From the start his energy always seemed too hyper, which was quite a jolt considering that he was replacing Keith who was too lethargic at the end of his tenure, but seemed so essential to their jazzier explorations in the 70's. Mydland's song writing was even less of a good fit. This record does seem to showcase Mydland in particular as many describe. To me that is what warrants the two star rating. By the 90's Garcia had moved well along the steady decline that had begun at least 10 years earlier. Occasionally he would rally, but realistically for the most part Weir was forced to carry the band more and more as Garcia sadly declined on all fronts. On these recordings even Weir seems to give way to Mydland. Even though I do not care for the mix, it is the least of the problems here. If you are a big fan of Mydland you should enjoy this. If like me, you are not, look elsewhere.
0	Love this Song!!
0	And I never will. I will never understand why Nirvana was so popular. Granted, I was fairly young when "Nevermind" was released in 1991, but even today when I listened to it, I just didn't get it.  I did enjoy "Lithium." I'll give them that one. But the rest of the album is, quite simply, lifeless. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is one of the mediocrities that dominated rock radio in the early 90's.  You hardcore Nirvana fans need to understand something: Kurt Cobain was not a good guitarist. He was average at best. His riffs were one-dimensional and practically put me to sleep. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing horrible about his music. It's just . . . average. I wouldn't have given this album such a bad review if it weren't for its massive popularity. Nirvana did absolutely nothing for rock music except make Guns N' Roses seem uncool. Which is a shame because Guns N' Roses were far superior.  I am sorry to say it, but "Nevermind" is not a classic. People may remember it, but it hasn't aged well. It's sad, really. Cobain sealed his legendary status by dying young. While it was a tragedy what happened to him, he wasn't anything special. One reviewer compared him to Jim Morrison. I laugh.

1	Played Jukebox Hero as soon as I got it downloaded. Garbage!! What a ripoff. Get this s*** off my phone now
1	Can't loose with the king!
0	The performance of Swing Low Sweet Chariot will never be matched. Beautiful, expressive choral singing.
0	Always biased toward anything sung by Johnny Mathis, but especially this duet with Deniece Williams.
1	Although this song is considered a one hit wonder, it is a must have track for any fan of 80's dance music and an excellent song for any workout playlist, on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, "I Like You" peaked at #1 in 1985. Also Nelson's "Move Closer" reached #1 on the UK charts in 1985.
0	Would wanted a few more popular songs
1	one of their best
1	Amazon has great songs and a good price, I don't always like to have to spend more for a whole cd if I only want a song or two.
0	first song was good
0	This album is even better than I thought it was going to be.  Completely exceeded my expectations!
0	Love it!
0	If your goal is to use this as a soundtrack for performance singing, it is not an easy CD to sing to.  It is not sang exactly as the song was created.  There are extra words added.
1	Never like her first single and never like this song at all ! Quit hogging all the airplay and let the other artists shine for once. Please stop making music. Purchase my albums instead , you'll thank me later.
1	Not the best musical efforts I've heard.  Using the names of American founding statesmen probably was a less than awesome idea.  To me, it could've been called something else and expecting something else.  Didn't like it, simple as that.  Don't see how the ratings are so high, and I sure don't see how they could make money off of a Broadway musical like this. Thumbs down.
0	Scotty's voice could make any song sound great. His style of singing brings back a type of music voice we haven't heard in a long time.  I love Christmas in Heaven because it is personal to me. Keep on singing those beautiful songs Scotty.
0	disc in real world situations so see if has any staying power and wether or not you will actually keep the disc in your car, ready to play, or if it will end up in the centor console of your car, burried under oil change receipts and dust rags. ???  Therefore, I have allowed time to pass. I have thrown it on my MP3 player with the old Sony $30 IPODish earphones. Great portability, lots of compression, hard to hear when mowing the yard.  Also burned copies of the original disc for my office and the old $60 bookshelf stereo as well as the copy for the old Hyunai Santa Fe stock CD player system (which is my best system and actually kicks pretty descent tail for a stock factory stereo).  The verdict - this disc has legs. No knee jerk reactions here. We have all read the reviews that popped up almost instantaneously.  They are always in 2 camps. There is the tribe that states "I love Chicago no matter what, I love Jason, Robert Look Hot. " The tribe on the other side of the island is of the "I hate the new Chicago that surfaced since 1970 / Chicago Died with Terry Kath / Jason Sucks - Cetera - Sucks / Everything Sucks".  It is fortunate that there are some fans that can curtail their review until the visceral response has passed. That is what we have here.  A little background. Started listening in 1985 with Chi 17 after seeing the band in concert in Springifield IL. This was during 5th grade. Anticpated the releases of 18, 19, & 21. I liked them at the time, but now find 21 to be a little lacking overall, but still like bits and pieces. Explored every disc that was released from CTA to Stone of Sisyphus with exception of the MULTITUDE of greatest hits. There is a great appreciationn here and roots of Chi are appreciated. Again, there are tracks on almost every disc that one can appreciated including Night and Day Big Band.  Have attended multiple concerts but have bored with hearing ONLY "the hits from the beginnings." While there is still a thrill for "Ballad for a Girl in Buchanon" during concerts, there was a desire to hear "Don't Get Around Much Anymore" from more than just one concert.  If you have made it this far, than you can deal with long winded S.O.B.'s and must have some patience. So, here it is, in a nutshell - This disc can stand on it's own. It has a little bit of everything for almost everyone and, if people could quit digging in their friggin heals so hard and quit being so bullheaded, they would see this is a good disc.  If you are a moldy oldy, skip the first 6 tracks or so and you will have what you need. Lots of horns, lots of soul, and lots of "older sounding" Chicago.  If you are a "I'm still stuck in the 80's" Chi fan, you will find the first 6 tracks or so (and I'm being a little vague here I know) you will find this right up your ally. There is even the track with Jason sounding almost Cetera-ish (Love Will come Back to You).  However, if you can put EVERYTHING into context and know a little history, this disc is a FANTASTIC accomplishment for the band. After a decade of nothing but rehashes, a cecade of touring and playing oldies, 10 years of covers (Christmas / N&D B.B.) and failed projects (S.O.S.) we have a 30th disc that pays homage to where we have been with Chicago as well as where we are now.  By stretching a little past what the "Monday Morning Quarterbacks" (read "SUPER FANS") want, the band has included a version of "Feel" that is receiving radio plays and generating buzz, a version of "Feel" that should make the older generation happier because it has horns.  They also have a duet with a female artist which works and a duet with a Country group that may actually allow them some crossover play (the crossover song with Rascal Flatts is great, but it could have been ANYONE working with them on this track and it is still a strong song).  The band, the agent, the producer, or whoever was smart enough to realize that some balance needed to occur on this disc. What we have here is a disc that isn't from Wisconsin (the land of cheese) like Chicago 21, and that can be played in a car stereo with little embarrasment. Yeah, there is LOTS of production on this disc, but it makes it fun to listen to.  If you haven't bought the disc, go for, it is a good buy and a great listen. If you have and hate it, sell the thing on Amazon or Ebay and go back to your phonograph and vinyl. That catalog is still there.  It is my hope that this gives Chi the opportunity to play something a little fresher in concert, perhaps make some more music in the future if they like, and even pave the path for the release of the "LOST CD" on specialty basis as some have mentioned about Rhino possibly doing.  Thank you Chi for giving us a new disc. Many of us see it for what it is and are enjoying more and more each day!  I welcome your thoughts, reviews, and responses to this disc. I hope I have explained myself and that you can do the same.
1	Only a few seconds of this song plays.  Something is wrong with the download.
