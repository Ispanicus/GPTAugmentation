0	I fell in love with the original version of this duet.  Unfortunately, it's the Metro Mix that is being sent out on mp3.  If I had known that, I wouldn't have ordered this track.
0	I went to order another song and this one leeched onto my download. Now all I can see is this order, but the other song doesn't show in my cloud or my order history?
0	WOW what a lousy CD. This girl's  talent is a ZERO and you know what. the RECORDING quality is even worse!  If your an IPOD person then it won't make any difference. but if your into high quality high end audio (the snobby stuff) then this recording will make you puke ! Amy . get a job at BURGER KING and set us free.
0	was totaly disappointed. was not famliar with the version he sang on Mary did you know.
0	Like most people I loved this song's beat and had planned to add it to my 'summer soundtrack." Fortunately I looked up the lyrics (right around the time of the Ohio school shooting) and just felt a sick feeling that wouldn't go away. (I had to watch multiple episodes of Colbert to feel a little better then listened to some Feist to get rid of the feeling.) Once you know what you're humming along to, you'll probably hate the song too. I'm deleting the song along with the rest of their album. I'll look for another cool sounding band whose lyrics don't promote the devaluing of life.
0	Another sellout materialistic rapper; spittin dumbass lyrics w/ his annoying azz mumble and clenched teeth.  One of the crappiest albums i've ever heard.  The last 50 Cent album that deserves any props is "Guess Who's Back" where some of the newer tracks on it are still garbage.  Not to mention 50's a b*tch & a snitch.
0	I got a hint from other reviews that this album was DIFFERENT from his others but not really.  It uses a wider range of instruments and sounds and is as usual hyper-creative and jam-packed with musical ideas - the likes of which will strain the ear of the untraind listener. Unless you love Vai, don't get this.
0	I don't know what happened with this effort.  I have yet to stop listening to Hellbilly Deluxe and Sinister Urge.  However,I have listened to Educated Horses (through) once, maybe twice. I just cannot make myself listen to it.  And that is really sad because I love Rob Zombie and his music.
0	This "music" can be downloaded for free on his own website and even then it's not worth the storage space on your computer. It's vulgar, offensive, lacking any sort of creativity, it's mostly just a mashup of words that the man thinks is funny put to poorly formed and repetitive "music".
0	One of the best songs and movie ELVIS Made.
0	When I downloaded this it only did the last three songs. I haven't figured out why yet, and I haven't had a chance to ask amazon what might be the problem. I expect problem free delivery every time from amazon and I'm not happy I have to take the time to deal with this!
0	I'm pretty disappointed in this, but only because we are avid listeners of "Through a dogs ears: Music to calm your canine" . I have the first 2 volumes. Which were $10 each on itunes. And then I bought this and except for maybe one 2 minute track, it is literally the same CD I already have with some thunder playing over it. Which I could have done myself with the two CDs I've already bought and a youtube video - and not spent another almost $20. Just seems a little excessive. Also, my dogs are not nearly as phased with the sound effects on the CD as they are with the real deal, so even when they pay no mind to the CD, real storms are still a mess.
0	I found this album quite boring for Type O Negative.  It lacked the dark humor and heavy-metal musicality that the other albums have.  Sorry Type O Negative, but don't buy this album, I couldn't even listen to the whole thing once.  Spend your money on my fav, October Rust.
0	What a rip off of Katy Perry. Wow! How no one has noticed is unbelievable!
0	I love the Chicks and was quite excited when I saw this new release.  Most of the songs are mediocre, some at best. The 2 bright spots are "See You in The Spring" . the lyrics are haunting and I love the play on words, vocals and harmonies.  The 2nd is "Ain't No Son of Mine" . but I have to say, following the harmonic intro, I was just waiting for Natalie to burst in with her edgier vocals.  The CD is growing on me, but at best I love 2-3 songs . vs. the Chicks I've overplayed CDs until I had to replace them.  Please reunite soon!
0	The sound of money burning is better than this music. Don't purchase
0	Amazon should remove this version or provide a warning. There is an almost 7 second delay at the beginning of the song. Thus you realize your error and have to buy the version that says (u. S. Version) that starts on queue. Don't waste your money like I did.
0	Really like Bryan Adams, but wow, the production on this album is really awful. The songs might be okay if they were re-worked a bit.
0	If you love uninspired, meandering blues with sparse, muddy lyrics and a heavy bass line that seems to have been added as an afterthought: this is so your recording. This one goes in the "to be sold second hand" lot today.
0	Not the original song, but came up first in the search results from the Android app.
0	I am very disappointed!  The wording on the description claims "various artists" leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original 80's artists.  IT IS NOT!  It is a mix sung by a "wedding singer/cruise line" type of band.  Is it even legal for a CD to be published with remakes of original artists song's without the permission of the original artists?  Hopefully this band paid for the rights to use these artists songs.  VERY MISLEADING AND DISAPPOINTING!
0	Although I am a fan of Flyleaf and their unique sound, I was thoroughly disappointed with this album.  Unfortunately this album sounds like a conglomeration of all the other bands out there.  There are only three songs I really care to listen to.  After that I pop in their old self-titled album (which is the sole reason why I became a fan).  I wouldn't waste your money.  If you can just buy tracks 2, 3 and 7.
0	I emailed the sender 2 or 3 times about my purchase. he never got back to me. and i never got my purchase. i am very displeased. i don't reccomend him if this is how he treats his buyers.
0	Beware all Capitol Beatle titles in the Russian CD Maxim series! Though all of the songs are presented in the exact US sequences, they are NOT the original US Capitol mixes. That's why I only give two stars instead of what could have easily been five stars. What CD Maxim has done is simply lift the same exact mixes heard on the legitimate CD's which have been available since the mid 80's, and rearrange the songs in the US playing order. Most notably, there is no echo or reverb to be heard in "I Feel Fine" and "She's A Woman". The US mixes were intentionally made to sound wetter, to better suit the ears of the American market. The UK CD masterings heard here are noticeably more dry. For the real US Capitol thing, try "The Capitol Albums Vol. 2" 4 CD Box Set", which contain both the original Stereo and Mono US Capitol mixes (get the second pressing with the small SK-1 indicated on the white attached label next to the cataolg #; first pressings without the SK-1 accidentally had folded down Monos from Stereo. SK-1's have the actual original Capitol Monos and Stereos). These are sourced from the original Capitol master tapes. OR try the Dr. Ebbett's CD versions, supurbly sourced from previously unplayed Capitol LP originals (they do sound warmer and not as bright). [.]
0	Kendrick Lamar's Section. 80 was a classic ahead of its time. It is still an album being slept on and the features/samples throughout the entire project are absolute beauties. Therefore, my negative one star review is not against the music itself, but by the bootleg. For years, bootleggers have been doing their CD game and that's fine - it is easy to pinpoint a bootleg CD instead in comparison to their original counterparts; however, recently, bootleggers are now in the vinyl game, heavy.  Which, there is really no problem with. Some albums, such as Yeezus, never received a proper vinyl release and it is disappointing. This is where high quality bootlegs come in and save the day; however, too many bootleggers are claiming "rare, original, out of print vinyl." Just be honest with me and put it at a price where you can still make money. They're all over eBay and they're slowly integrating onto Amazon. Legend has it, Section. 80's only official release of the vinyl was on a tour, but I've never seen a real one, so far, posted online or otherwise.
0	Alanis Morisette's first album, "Jagged Little Pill", was the zenith for affected, bitter female ranters.  It was one of the few albums where it was radio-worthy in spite of itself - the more obtuse the analogies were, the more intriguing a listen it became. Now, was "Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie" a misstep?  Perhaps from a commercial sense, but as an album it's surprisingly good - a mature collection of songs written from a place of self-awareness without being over the top.  And it took some chances musically that should've been applauded instead of reviled. Morisette's third effort, "Under Rug Swept", seems like an attempt to reconcile the commercial success of the first album with the creative growth illustrated in the second.  Unfortunately, it spends way too much time sounding like "Jagged Little Pill 2 - The Sequel" than an album onto itself.  Tracks like "Hands Clean", "Flinch" and "That Particular Time" sound like outtakes from her first album, to the point that "Hands Clean" goes over territory written about better in "Right Through You." When the album is accessible ("Precious Illusions", "21 Things I Want In A Lover") it really goes no further than being radio-friendly alt-pop.  And when it's not, as in the ridiculous "Utopia", it's pretty much intolerable. "Under Rug Swept" seems like a compromise album written by someone under pressure from her record company to produce hits while not compromising artistic integrity.  Sadly, it appears she does neither in this case.
0	We were given a set of CDs from Sunny Day studios and absolutely loved them.  I thought I was safe ordering these to supplement what we already had.  For some reason, these CDs don't even sound like they were done by the same people!  I found these CDs to be very mediocre compared to the other Sunny Day studio CDs that we have.  The voices were not as good and the arrangements were boring.  This purchase was very disappointing.
0	One of the Beach Boys great hits but the sound quality was unacceptable. I don't think that it was due to my devices.
0	the best songs on the album do not seem to include the title Ron Sexsmith song.  There are 2 bands called "Hard Bargain", both blues-oriented, one in Denmark, the other in USA (NY/NJ area) -  [.] also on iTunes!
0	I saw the music video and knew I needed the song! I loved the video because they a) changed the lyrics a bit which I liked, and B) had no talking in the song. So I buy this song but its not the same at all. Same old lyrics (not like the official music video) and there is talking throughout. lame.
0	Margie:  Yes, I listened to this and she sounds BORED! Get it through your thick skull, she (twila)is jumping on the worship bandwagon trying to generate a college fund.  First off, do we really need another "worship" CD from ANYONE? Enough already!  That being said, I am a HUGE TP fan but this release leaves me wanting more.  I have seen her live over 20 times and she never sounded THIS bad.  While her voice is flawless as ever, I just think she sounds bored and un-inspired.  Listen to her read her canned response to the audience, I can tell she is not into it, even her vocals sound dull and flat.  Twila, go back to the studio and do what you do best. If you want to do a live CD, that is fine go back and get some tapes from the "same girl" tour or even "True North" and release some of THAT material.  We love you Twila, we just know you can do better than this.  PS:  I really should give this a one star but I cant, not for Twila!
0	It seems like he accepts any project that is offered to him. Soulja Boy really? Horrible remix of a horrible song.
0	screwed up and bought the wrong thing.
0	Quality of the 75% of this album sound like they were recorded with a mic. its almost funny. i mean what did i expect for $5? There is a quality and quantity difference.
0	THIS MAN  IS A WOMANIZING JERK. PIMP PREACHER , GOD HELP ANYONE THAT THINKS DIFFERENT . god will get him what is done in the dark will be brought to the light. i cant wait
0	The Lion Of Judah is just another great spirited song.  This song just like all other Karen Wheaton songs will really lift your spirit.
0	Willie Nelson is a classic all by himself. This album, in which he couples up with various female vocalists, is disappointing. The female vocalists do not enhance Willie's efforts and sometimes they diminish his music. There are a few exceptions, however, and, as one might expect, his duo with Dolly Parton is very good. Dolly has a way of making everyone she works with seem better for having done so. Unless you are a diehard Willie Nelson fan, I would skip this CD.
0	Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
0	I am disappointed, not in this recording, because I wanted it very much.  But in Amazon, because I cannot download the music in my itunes.
0	Not sure who ordered this. Wasn't me. Sorry for the mix up. Can't speak on a product I do not know.
0	Didn't downland to my Samsung phone.
0	Made a mistake on this version (jazz).
0	Some music fans (note: the word "fan" is derived from "fanatic."), will go to great lengths in denial defending their Gods.  In this case the Gods are The Crash Test Dummies.  This "collection" is so bad, in so many ways, only a true "fanatic" would find any redeeming qualities in it.  It really is an insult to anyone who bought it.
0	Not sure how this got on my account.  I never bought it or even listened to it.  I don't even know what it is (a movie or music cd).
0	Rape apologist music. Don't support Leslie and her band. Plus, the music is derivative.
0	A piece of crap: poor sound quality and bad song selection. Stick with the legitimate Smile and Good Vibration outtakes. I collect the Beach Boys and would have no problem shelling out $99 for a decent set. I wouldn't by this at half the price.
0	The contents of this order did not match the description at all
0	Are you kidding me. I reallY don't know an what to say. This is terrible, hideous WITH actually.  i ll never shop and drink bud light again. buggers. lol. my fault totally. IT HAPPENS. SERIUSLY YOU'LL END UP WITH SOME CRAPPY STUFF, DON T D & S MORON. LOL
0	Let me say that I am a huge Paul Simon fan.  I own several of his albums, both in a digital and vinyl format.  His body of work is most impressive and there is very little he has produced that I do not care for.  I so wanted to like this album, but it was not to be.  While I applaud the musicianship, the songs are just plain strange and do not appeal to me.  He is such a versatile and talented artist, this collection simply does not do him justice.
0	Terrible.  Couldn't listen even for 20 minutes.
0	The vinyl quality is awful. I have purchased used vinyl from 40 years ago that sound better. It was disappointing.
0	Sux. Not a good hook or beat or anything. Sounds like something that took like five minutes to make. Sux
0	This doesn't sound like Flogging Molly at all!  I don't know what they were thinkin releasing this as a lead off single!  This album will not be blind buy (buy based on who it is alone, unheard) for me, which for this band will be a 1st.  The idea of that alone has me disappointed already.  I guess I can only cross my fingers that this may have been simply the 1st song to be finished & not in any way a strong song off the album.
0	Thought this was an actual Broadway version. Turns out it was accompaniment by piano only in an intimate setting. Was stylistically unemotional. My bad for not making sure it was what I wanted.
0	This is an awesome song, it just moves me into worship and thanksgiving for knowing that it is well with my soul.
0	Another I did not order!  Where are these going to?
0	Joe Derosa is a comedian that progressed in his career not through being funny, but by being a good drinking buddy. He's the kind of guy that throws his own birthday party and invites agents and managers. He is one hell of a "networker". the pond scum of the comedy community. He rides the coat tails of any successful comedian he can sink his fingernails into. Be it Robert Kelly, Bill Burr, Pete Holmes, Opie & Anthony, or whoever. he is ALWAYS vastly inferior to the people he surrounds himself with.  If that sounds like the kind of "comedian" you want to waste hours of your life listening to than "Mistakes Were Made" is the album for you! This Double CD is a testament to a delusional man that is full of self-importance, minuscule humor, and a failing career.
0	I mean, it's a long classic rock song, so if you want to get your money worth for that lap dance at the local boob-bar, request this.  Otherwise, it's mediocre music from a grandstanding jackass and self-declared expert on a few things of which he is poorly informed.  "The Nuge" hasn't had an original thought in decades and reacts predictably to any ideas that challenge his worldview.
0	This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.  Imagine you knew someone was going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour. now try to relax.
0	If ever there was a song that aspires to be something more, but leaves you feeling 'meh', this is it.  Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande are already big time, chart-topping talents.  Jessie J is getting close to that status (already scoring hits with "Domino" and "Price Tag").  "Bang Bang" is a song designed to bring three sexy powerful voices together for a sexy, raunchy tune.  It ends up being just an 'ok' song (more like a 2 1/2 star song, rather than the 2 I'm giving it).    It's hard to quantify why "Bang Bang" doesn't deliver.  Though, in all likelihood, it is because the studio over-produced this track, which typically happens when multiple big talents are brought together.
0	After discovering the background music from a radio, I tried listening to the music on my laptop. I was immediately requested to validate the CD due to the number of illegal CD's currently on the market. This was in fact one of them. BEWARE!
0	This recording has been edited to make it sound as though the singers never pause to take a breath . . . which is disturbing.
0	I was very disappointed that I did not see the part that said could not be played in the USA and could not return if opened. well I didn't know I couldn't watch it untill after I opened it. So I am stuck with a DVD that we can not watch. Lesson Learned.
0	for meditation type music I rate by the quality of the voice and how well I can understand it. The voice was a bit annoying for me and there was an accent, perhaps British, that got in the way.
0	I am very dissatisfied with the product. The label only lists titles to 22 #s on the CD, but there are actually 34. It does not provide information as to what the subliminal messages are. I have twice sent e-mails to the Weight Loss Institute requesting more information, but they have not yet replied.
0	Very disappointing.  Should be titled "The Things We Use to do."  The second CD's just keeps ejecting on every device I've tried.  The other CD, the one that does play is trite, repetitive and does not bode well  for the the band's legacy.  But it does have swirling voices and noises to remind us that they were once a great force for psychedelic Rock.  Pity Really
0	I think it's so good message is great I just love it.i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but This gets all the stars .
0	I have hear of him before and like his singing. Before I purchase please list the songs and some samples to hear.  It greatly benefits the purchaser from making a mistake.
0	I want my money back from this download. Very disappointing! I was mislead into thinking that there would be rap lyrics the radio version. Instead I just got music and NO lyrics! Please refund my money and delete this song from my list!
0	I did not ask for this music and I consider it to be in really bad taste that Amazon added it my download. It took me a while to figure out where it came from. This is a really bad practice. I paid money to download music I wanted to buy from Amazon. If you think paying customers won't be annoyed, think again. Sorry to be harsh, but I was really annoyed, and you asked for a review. Anytime software I download installs extra items I did not intend to download I find it invasive. I wanted to buy music from Amazon. In order to do that I had to install software. That software installed music I did not intend to download.
0	This is one I think I will just buy the MP3 download and burn it to a CD for less money. I previewed all the songs and I honestly do not think this Christmas CD is as good as her Rejoyce CD was. Although this CD is better than recent CDs she put out and her singing is better I would have liked to have seen some different, more traditional songs and more songs on the CD. I can't bring myself to order a CD with only 10 songs on it anymore, when you see more cds with 15+ on them. Not to mention you can download and make your own mix with up to 20-25+ songs on it. I'll be looking for a new Christmas CD from her next year and hope it's better than this one.
0	this was not a complete download, I only received 2:39 minutes
0	this is what happens when you get "action movie" writers to make a screenplay for what should be more of a horror western. generic plot, generic malkovich bad guy, and barely any time spent on character development. i was going to spare the director since he did OK considering what he had to work with, but then i read on IMDB that he was responsible for the music. it wasn't bad music, but it had no place in this movie.
0	I know these people put out better stuff than this one. If you like hearing the sound of a cat straining to be heard. this is it. Ugh! Sorry. I surely ordered the wrong one.
0	"Nobody digs your music but yourself!" (Billy shouting to the kid in Purple Rain)  While we all dig the great Prince (may he rejoice in his new heavenly home), Radiohead seems to just be playing for themselves. I give Thom Yorke every chance - I (used to) buy nearly everything he/they released, but over the past few albums I gave up on him and his beyond odd, uh, music? It's not even music. More like loony electrical sounds he creates from a synth or excessive and unnecessary Pro Tools editing. This isn't even a band any more - it's engineers and programmers (who cannot hear). They completely threw out the song format. Hey man, ever heard of verse and chorus?  I've seen RH live and on TV. 75% of the audience just stands there sorta wondering WTH is going on? And the remaining 25% is out buying beer. On the bright-side, I can easily write new RH-ish songs from my PC keyboard or by letting my dog run across my piano or by dropping a can full of pennies. It's all just goofy sounds with whinny vocals reminiscent of a ally cat looking for love.  They have so much talent but they have lost their musical way. Too caught up in themselves I guess. The band needs to wake up and get back to songs like Creep, Fake Plastic Trees, Let Down, High and dry, 15 Steps, etc. They haven't evolved musically, the have dissolved.
0	Love the album so I decided to get it in vinyl but I am so disappointed. The vinyl isn't even mint green as described and it doesn't even bring the cd. I had to return to get a new one and it was exactly the same thing. I'm so sad
0	Dr. Dre ahs done a lot for hip hop over the eyrs, with his classic albums both solo and in NWA,a dn the success of his proteges Snoop and Eminem. This, however, was a very bad call. This guy's rapping ability is almost non-existant, he just mumbles incoherently. The songs aren't his own work, so I guess it's not his fault they're bland motonous and lyricaly immature, merely working off the new image of 'hip-pop' - where the social change, street-level rebellion and push for self-improvement are replaced by the worst of pimpz, gangstaz and gunz cliches. Most of this guy's audience don't realise how cheap and lame it all is. 50 Cent merely gives rap a bad name while being a simple money-makng machine. I almost thing the guy should go back to the dealing, at least he was good at that.
0	Love the album, but the vinyl skipped so badly that 'way down we go' was completely unintelligible. I would wait to get the vinyl until they release a monocolor vinyl
0	same as the others, I tried to download and it did not work. it erased every song on my ipod. Needless to say, i was very upset.
0	I like the music but the sound quality is poor.
0	After breaking out with Sigh No More, Babel shows no growth and maturity with this band.  As others have remarked, this album has songs that sound very similar to the others on the album.  After a while of listening, it's almost like you're listening to one long track.  Babel and I Will Wait are great, but I think collectively, this album takes a major step back from Sigh No More.  It's not terrible, it's just that I expected more from the next album.  I would be very surprised if this album were to take home any big music awards.
0	This is not the original song by Macklemore.  Just a cover song by somebody trying to cash in.  You can buy the original version cleaned up by downloading the one not labeled as explicit.
0	Disappointing, II have heard more spirited fuller sound renditions of Bands playing the  Military hymns for free, to  download online.
0	MOST SONGS ARE CHOPPED OFF AT THE END! NEXT SONG BEGINS WITHOUT ANY PAUSE BETWEEN! THIS SHOULD BE PULLED OFF AMAZON UNTIL THIS TECHNICAL PROBLEM IS CORRECTED. NICE MUSIC BY GREAT MUSICIANS BUT UNUSABLE SONG BY SONG. AND VERY DISTURBING WHEN A PIECE IS CHOPPED OFF. NONE OF WHICH IS EVIDENT IN THE PREVIEWS, OF COURSE.
0	i have many curt elling cd,s  and have enjoyed them all  this one is terrible.  i played it once and had a hard time getting thru it.  not recomended  to anybody.
0	This was my favorite song from the movie, and this version of it has the same mythical sound. Unfortunately, the publisher edited it to a disappointing 1 minute and 42 seconds: way too short! It's like a clip of the real, spellbinding, full-length song. Why?
0	The only FUNNY as Hell song of Snoops that I really even listened too.
0	Really only one good song on the album.
0	Well, it's difficulty think that John Fogerty can make a bad record but this one it is not as good as others he made. I consider "The Blue Ridge Rangers" first album from 1973 better than this "Rides Again". In the first record the stuff of songs is great and in this one the stuff is too commercial, I don't like it. Julie Fogerty was the person that selected the songs to be included in the record and not John Fogerty. Also in the first "TBRR" of 1973, John Fogerty played all instruments and in this one only played Acoustic Guitar. I think that "The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again" was only "made for sale" and it is not so interesting, but I'm a great fan and a great collector of "Creedence" and related and "I must to have this album in my whole collection".  Federico Andrs La Rocca.
0	I love the music of Halo.  While listening to Pandora one day, I decided to go ahead and buy the last three albums that I didn't already own.  The music is just phenomenal.  However, the jewel cases were all in some way damaged when they arrived.  One was chipped, another was cracked, and another won't let the CD snap into place because of damage.  Eventually, the CDs themselves will be scratched because of the shotty packaging by Amazon.
0	I am hugely disappointed. I loved "Boys & Girls" but do not like this album in the least.  I have listened three times all the way through now and still only moderately like two songs on the entire album.  Great Rock and Roll Band tries to do. I don't know what.  It's just not good.  I sincerely hope that after the band listens to this a few times they realize how bad this "new direction" is and go back to making music instead of "sound & color".  If you want to listen to "sounds" you'd be better off buying an old Frank Zappa album. I think a two star rating is generous.
0	I did not look closely enough at the list of songs on the soundtrack.  Didn't realize that there were 2 versions of Let It Go, one by Demi Lovato (ok, but very pop), and one by Idena Menzel (the one I wanted) which is AMAZING!  When I contacted Amazon they said too bad so sad.  Read more carefully next time.  I went ahead and bought the Idena version and deleted the Demi version.  I guess I am just out the cost of it.  If you like pop versions of amazing Broadway quality songs then you will like Demi's  As for me, I will stick with Idena, and read the list of songs more carefully next time, not just quickly scanning titles.
0	For starters, I've been a Luda fan for years. His lyrics have always been fresh, his beats hot, and his flow smooth. His flow is still smooth on this disk, but that's about it. Lets face it, this is a pretty commercial-oriented release. I really think the only track on it that is going to get any sort of play time in my library is Tell Me a Secret featuring Ne-Yo after the first listen. I heard how low at a bar a while back and wanted to vomit. On top of that, he has collaborated with gucci mane on a track, and that is just outright disappointing. If you've been to a club recently, you've heard this song 10,000 times, just by different artists. Lets get drunk, party party party, blah blah blah. Down tempo grind song. This whole album is far too commercial for my tastes, a dime a dozen. I would recommend, if you're a real Luda fan, torrent it or something. Don't buy it. Send him and artists like him a message: we won't take this crappy, thoughtless club music anymore. If I want club music, I'll get drunk and listen to it in a bar, because drunk is the only state of mind I can take this. But for my sober money, I want some hip hop with some substance.
0	I bought her first CD with great anticipation and loved hearing the voice I heard on BGT. I will agree that the tempo of the songs from the first CD were all very similar, but it was her clear, clean powerful voice that came through. This CD lacks the luster the first one had. I won't go into the song selections, but rather the somewhat worrisome sound of her voice. Just from the short selections on hand, I could hear her holding back that I didn't hear in her first CD. It sounds as if her vocal cords aren't connecting to each other as smoothly as they did when I first heard her sing on BGT and her first CD. I have also picked up a slight irritation of the vocal cords within her normal speaking voice on the video she has for "The Gift" that I didn't notice before. The nightmare of all nightmares is for a singer to strain her vocal cords. I do hope I'm wrong, but I'm picking up something in her voice that wasn't there before. I am tempted to buy the CD just to hear each cut all the way through. Perhaps my concerns will be removed and then I can truly say the selections were just not that great. I know she can certainly do better than this. She proved that to everyone around the world when she stepped out on stage and began to sing. How nice it would be to have those goose-bumps back again. Unfortunately this CD produced nothing of the sort. May her beautiful, powerful voice once again shine through. I'll be waiting.
0	There are just 4 songs on this CD and I only like "She keeps me warm" On one of the songs, she's "rapping" and you know what happens when you rap, you swear. So I wasn't too excited about that. :( Can't people sing a song without swearing?
0	This was Lorin Maazel's final concert as Director of the New York Philharmonic. I was at the second of the four performances, and was greatly disappointed (Pierre Boulez was conducting the Berlin forces in the piece the following week, and it was a tough choice. I'd heard his recording and was not overwhelmed. I have Maazel's Vienna recording and love it.) I subsequently listened to and recorded the radio broadcast of what sounded to be the same night. I must presume this is the same performance.  There was little excitement on the stage, and the rather dull acoustics of Avery Fisher Hall didn't help, either. The soloist were placed back from the front of the stage, men and women split far stage right and left. The second soprano had serious pitch problems toward the end of the evening and the bass was far too young and light of voice for Pater Profundis' horrendously difficult part.  There are a good many recordings of this symphony, probably too many. Maazel's earlier Vienna recording is one of my favorites, with an ethereal spiritual quality I've not heard from any other. Nothing like that is duplicated here. I'm sure that the availability of this performance is of great interest to its participants and their families. Anyone else would do better to look elsewhere.
0	This CD was too jazz for me.  I love Pat Methenys' Secret Story CD and many of his other ones but this one was not what I like.
0	Ok, Im probably gonna get flamed here, but I don't care. I have never like Nirvana, nor will I ever like them. Kobain's death was a tragic loss, I cared about him as a fellow human being, but never a musician. What else can I say about that. I grew up in the 70's and 80's, during the singer/songwriter time, and in the 80's during the Punk, New Wave, Hairband time, so for me, when Nirvana came along with their NEO-PUNK anthems, I hated it all. They said that the GRUNGE MOVEMENT defined GEN X, well not for me. I rebuke that. Grunge killed everything else, which alot  of you might think thats a good thing the Hairbands died, but I dont. The Gunge/NEO HIPPY scene of the early 90's made me sick to my stomach. I was born in 67, and my generation did not know a freaking thing about being hippies. Nirvana killed good music back then, as far as Im concerned, but hey, what is my opinion worth anyway. To each his own.
0	Did not ask for it and I never play it.
0	He tried something new, but it did not work.
0	DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! I don't know who it is but Grace Slick was nowhere anywhere singing on it. DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!
0	I was looking for the song that Willie does in his TV ad, but alas, this is not the one.  Forget what he is advertising and also not sure it is Willie, but sure sounds like him!
0	I was so excited to get the CD because I love quiet, guitar music at the holidays - Imagine my surprise when I put the CD in the player and heard something completely different - I am so very disappointed.
0	Dreary, unhappy, pretentious mush. Fully of sound effects and voices to cover up its basic emptiness. You'd think such a successful guy would articulate a more positive sentiment about life. Waters takes himself too seriously. He thinks too highly of himself as an "artist". Blah. Boring BS.
0	Not the version I wanted. This is a live concert recording, not the original in studio album version. Cock Robin were great, I am not fond of live albums.
0	This release is not that great.  I love Mezzanine, Protection and even 100th window for their dark melodies that have an aggresive sound.  This cd is a little lame and takes far too long to get used to and it just doesn't want repeat plays like the others.  Some of the singing just isn't that good.  There's a couple classic M.A. tunes here but a lot of "nothing" also.
0	It downloaded twice.  I called for credit.  They told me they had issued the credit but when I went to use my account again I notice I had not been issued the credit for this item.
0	Ben E. King is an excellent singerand knows how to deliver his message. Love everything he's made, he takes you back you back to an era whe music touched the soul.
0	My husband and I were in Bayside Miami a few weeks back.  We were joined by my Cousin who I had not seen in over 30 years.  As we walked in the Bayside area he mentioned of the music that usually plays there and how people enjoy dancing.  So we went there and were able to appreciate the music of Erica Denz and her band.  It was great!  The dancer and back up singer of the group started to go through the group of expectators selling what was supposed to be this CD posted on this Amazon website.  To our surprise the CD had some rappers music with questionable lyrics even though the label shows Ms. Denz's songs.  We've attempted to call and send messages to Ms. Denz multiple time to let her know of this matter but have been unsuccessful.  She does not return calls nor replies to her Facebook messages.  This is very disappointing and disconcerting to us.  We paid $20 for two CDs.  Folks I would think it twice before buying this CD.  We were ripped off!  We reported this incident to the Miami Attorney General.  No. I would not buy her CDs because she has evaded/ignored our telephone messages and facebook emails.  So sad to take advantage of tourists like that because they know they are leaving and most likely won't listen to the CD's until after they are gone from Miami.
0	Just purchased this song and the file I received was a bad copy. Had the same issue with another download. Not sure what is happening with Amazon's music files.
0	I've been with Chevelle since the beginning, since Point #1.  I was at the shows where they actually played songs from Point #1.  I am a HUGE Chevelle fan.  I think they're probably the best modern rock band out there.  Extremely creative, heavy, with impressive song writing.  This album was absolutely a massive let-down for me.  Did they go heavier?  Yes.  Is there more screaming than any other Chevelle album?  You bet.  These are not bad things.  In fact, a new direction is cool.  Good to evolve and stay fresh.  But there's almost no substance.  And much of the album has the same sound.  There are few stand-out songs.  It's like Pete decided to go heavier and then put little to no effort in backing up the heavy with the usual Pete rock genius.  The album opens up strong, like most Chevelle albums.  Door to Door Cannibals is easily one of the best songs on the album.  I dig it for sure, although it's weaker than most Chevelle openers.  Enemies - one of the worst Chevelle songs ever.  This song is simply awful.  Even the recording quality is terrible.  It's just. awful. Joyride - pretty good, although one of their weakest radio songs.  I still dig it.  One of the album's stand-outs for sure.  Still, it pales in comparison to An Island and Hunter Eats Hunter off Gargola. Rivers - a weird mix.  Starts out with a weird vibe, like a serenade at a cheap Italian restaurant.  Then it goes heavier. then back to cheap Italian restaurant vibe.  The heavier parts are simply okay.  A weird mix and very mediocre song. Last Days - weak.  Just . weak.  Same recycled sound from most of the album but with zero substance.  Filler. Young Wicked - this song had potential and was ruined by having kids chanting at a few parts.  Stupid.  Why?  Why, Pete, why? Warhol's Showbiz - same tune.  Recycled.  No substance.  Boring. Punchline - slower but dark, like the vibe from Twinge off Gargola.  I like it.  I dig Pete going darker with his slow songs.  This is good. Got Burned - more filler.  Repetitive.  Not good.  Simply not good. Shot from a Cannon - maybe my favorite song off the album.  At just over 8 minutes, this is a stand-out and a new accomplishment for Pete and the band.  Pretty epic.  Solid.  Love this song.  Love the wandering path it takes.  Heavy and slow, but not boring.  Really, really like this one.  So. strong opener and strong closer, but the middle is mostly weak and repetitive.  By Chevelle standards, this album is awful.  By most bands' standards, this is a very okay album.  But I judge Chevelle against a higher standard.  Hats Off to the Bull was a masterpiece.  La Gargola was decent (for Chevelle).  This is much worse. easily Chevelle's weakest album.  I predict a lot of the excited positive reviewers change their mind after several listens.  I think it'll start to run together and people will easily burn out on this album.  I had in hand the day it came out, like my other Chevelle albums, but I may hesitate and sample their next album more before buying.  I hope they can get back on the upswing after this lackluster effort.
0	Purchased this song but I never actually received it. It shows I purchased it but I cannot add it to my songs.
0	To put it short and sweet, this is nothing like a Gorillaz album.  It's mostly instrumental, and very basic at that. Don't get me wrong, it is creative and artistic, but it lacks any grandness or memorability.  It just continues the downward spiral that started with Plastic Beach. I've been a fan since the beginning, but according to the general consensus, you may love this or hate this.  I think everyone can agree that this is the least entertaining Gorillaz album. An ipad instrumental album just wasn't necessary.
0	How did this awful crap get 5 stars? I was a big big fan of their albums Load, Reload, and the awesome St. Anger, so I decided to give this one a try.  First off, the bass is awful! I'm so glad that Cliff died, because he tried to play bass like Limp Bizkit and failed. Also, the songs are abysmal. In For Whom the Bell Tolls, they try to emulate St. Anger and put no solos in it, but it fails. And Fade to Black is an obvious attempt to be emo, but it did not make me want to cut my wrists. All the other tracks on the album are bad as well, and James' voice sounds prepubescent.  Get St. Anger instead.
0	This music is actually soothing, but the profane words on it go entirely against that grain. The 'art' attached to this song is shocking to the point I became increasingly aware I never should have ordered this for my son. He took his mp3 player on the Christian retreat & there's that terrible white & pink wording. This could have been a 100% preventable regrettable purchase if the artists showed a little more knowledge that it is very good music actually up until the cuss words calling beautiful women by exploitive labels, & does work really well just leaving the profanity in the song & album cover out of it.
0	Cannot compare to The Four Canadian Tenors.  Arrangements and vocalization lacking.  Good for elevator music and long car trips.  Not impressed
0	It sort of sounds like this was recorded later, and is not quite the original.  I like the song, but something isn't right.
0	My husband really wanted this cd and our Granddaughter Lexi Williams in Santan Valley AZ bought it for him for Christmas and had it shipped directly to us and it doesn't play. tried it in 5 differant players. we need a replacement
0	First off, the album itself is 5 star. This particular vinyl pressing is what makes this one star. I was excited because it was on a daily deal. I knew there was a more recent 180g pressing but Id bought the earlier pressings of Master and Kill Em All and they sound great. This record, however, does not. No dynamic range, barely any bass, and no in your face guitar.  I recommend buying the 180g version. I haven't personally heard it, but Im hearing that pressing sounds great.
0	Definitely a waste of my damn money! Ugh! I heard the chorus and thought it was a hit, BUT BOY WAS I WRONG! The lyrics are garbage and it appears that Schoolboy Q is just sitting some where in a studio drunk and high searching for various random things to say and somehow this lackluster colloquial mumbo jumbo made the air waves! What a total disappointment! I want my money back! BARF!
0	I am a dog trainer with South Orlando Dog Training and unfortunately, this program didn't work with my thunderstorm phobic dog. This is not to say it won't work with your dog. It could and I think it is worth trying. But I tested this system over the course of 6 weeks. Over those weeks, my dog desensitized to the thunderstorm sounds on the CD even though I played the CD over my best sound system. It did not help him with real thunderstorms and the reason I think it didn't is because of the complexity of real thunderstorms that audio tracks cant mimic. The winds pick up, it gets noisy outside, gets dark and cloudy, and theres that familiar smell of ozone that I think a dog can smell way before any of us. In fact, I don't know a thunderstorm is coming until I see my dog start to perk up and get alert. If you want a more detailed synopsis of how I tested it, email me through my web site, www.southorlandodogtraining.com
0	Sorry, attempting to sing Sinatra songs was way over his head.  Showed great difficulty in hitting and holding a note.  Thumbs down
0	Ok, this smells like "Desperate Measures" but taken literally.  Most bands will NOT make a live album or DVD after ONE release.  Not saying HU made a terrible choice, but it sounds like Swan Songs didn't go as far as they wanted it to.  I absolutely love HU, but this was not a smooth choice.  Linkin Park and Mudvayne made the same mistake but luckily they redeemed themselves.  HU just seemed desperate for money with this release.
0	i like stevie wonders version better lol.  Pharrell loves biting the classics. either way, its a good song, but im so tired of hearing it Im considering drinking 5 more scotches tonight.
0	I am the Script super fan. I would be a groupie if my job allowed it. When #3 came out I bought it right away. I am so sad to say I was severely disappointed. Way too much. would you call that rapping? was taking place in the majority of the tracks. Their 2nd CD changed my life, this one I would like my money back.
0	I bought this to listen on my workout.  I was expecting something like "Cuts Like a Knife."  This song was less than energetic.  I didn't buy the whole album, so maybe this is different, but this is definitely not the old Bryan Adams!
0	The quality of the download was not very good.
0	In a wurld waer libberall techers and professers ar dun telling uz baloney about de wurld bein' round, and kreated in ober a pazillion years, dese folkes dun cum out dun tell us to teche!

YEE HAW!
0	Bought this to get one song off of  the mix.  Unfortunately, the songs are sped up; so if you want the original timing, you won't get it here.
0	I love the 60s and 70s music available but I can't download it into my iTunes library no matter how many times I try.  I even went to the help page and followed the recommendations but without luck.  I'd purchase more from Amazon, but not as long as I can only listen to it in the Cloud.
0	I am so disappointed in Jewel! I own all of her other albums, her poetry, and i LOVE her. But this album is a seel out. Jewel's unique and beautiful music are taken over by a POP style, and it disgusts me. I suppose musicians do this all the time, however it's just very disappointing that one of my fave singers is a sell out. its all about the buck.
0	these are NOT the original songs that we all know and love.  well, they ARE, but they are re-recorded with very poor music and sound like you opened up a large barrel and put a band down in there to play.  this should have never got released.
0	I downloaded this on accident . gave it a listen and turned it off . saw the video and almost threw up in my mouth . this is not Hiphop . probably some kind of wierd RAP music
0	it doesn't reach out and grab you! Her voice is too beautiful to not have producers who can make music to complement it!
0	I buy all of the 50, 100, 99, and whatever Amazon decides to have for a simple reason. For a buck (almost all of them), I have a list already created with music I enjoy listening. You really can't go wrong with them, regardless of the repeated tracks, or average interpretations. However, this time I am very disappointed for the simple fact that the composer info is not provided. This is unacceptable, and I hope the publishers of this album will rectify and provide the information in the future. Until then, I can't recommend this one, hence the one star.
0	I was really expecting this to be a great CD but was really disappointed.  I've played it once, and that's probably all I'll be playing it.  I didn't particularly like the songs and couldn't say much for the arrangements.  The 30 seconds snippets that you get to listen too really made me think it was going to be fantastic, but they took the best 30 seconds of the songs and the rest is just so-so.
0	I've been a DT fan since the debut album and have loved virtually everything they've ever done. But, if I'm being honest,  this is horrible.  Most of the songs really sound like incomplete thoughts, unlike typical DT songs that explore every avenue of a theme with a build, climax and resolution.  There are times that some of content sounds like bad Broadway Music. And there are far too many ballads. After putting out 2 of the greatest ever DT albums, this is grossly disappointing. There are really only 3 good songs, and they're not even great. Sounds like they've gone back to burying the bass in the mix, too. That's disappointing after the mix on the last album. I've read that they plan on playing the whole album in its entirety live. Ugh! Let's hope for a rebound in 3 years.
0	When I open it, it is already broken into two pieces! This is a really bad cd I ever bought
0	Don't buy it unless your a Spanish teacher, have young kids, or need to use it for a class project (like I did). So annoying.
0	My record came with big brown scratches on both sides. Still able to play it, but I was very disappointed.
0	I purchased this song but it is not added to cloud and I can't play it. Please help me out
0	Bought it Downloaded it Have no clue where it is.
0	Didn't know it was the concert version.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.
0	This is an excellent performance of a very obscure (but not unimportant) opera. However, this is a 1 disc highlight issue, which is not called out in the description. very disappointing.
0	Wish I had paid more attention to the track listing, way too many songs from eMotive, which was a terrible album. Only good song on that album was "Passive" which is less than stellar on this live recording. If this had been almost exclusively songs from their first two albums then that would have made for an awesome album. Only thing that would have made me more upset than paying for this album that I will probably never listen to again would have been paying to go to this show when it happened. This review is from an original Tool fan from back in the mid 90's who has generally likes most of what Maynard has done with Tool and APC.
0	Can no longer download songs to my media player. I would not have purchased had I known.  Customer service was not able to help me, but they were very nice.  Have not played the music, any chance I could get a refund?
0	I was upset to find that this verision cut out all the good stuff that makes this song so special.  I would not recommend this verision.
0	If you are a doowop novice then this item may be of interest to you.  The tunes are some of the very best in the doowop genre, and at a relatively decent price although shipping & handling costs have skyrocketed to make even relatively 'cheap' purchases more expensive.  At a total price that may be less than $10.00 I would search for more comprehensive and larger selection at this same price .
0	All of the selections sound muted and muddied.  They are of such poor quality that the pieces do not sound as the should. This is not even worth your time for the free download!
0	Can't believe how unfunny a comidean can be. Only person less funny is Andy kindler. The fact that I'm forced to even give it 1 star pisses me off
0	I feel cheated. What I received were 4 paper thin plastic records. About 10 inch in diameter. Who calls them LPs? Total weight of these 4 so called LPs was not even 40 grams. And they were sold to me as 4 LP set. Highly disappointed. 
0	This is supposed to be an accompaniment track (no voices).  However, it's the original song.  I previously purchased the original, and was looking for the version without voices for a memorial DVD.  Ended up with an adequate version from another company (Christian Rock, the Best of. . .).
0	I like the live version so much better
0	A few good songs but far too few in 2:30 play time. Flat footed biography of depressingly boring historical conservative. Let's see he kept US from deadbeat status on revolutionary loans. Arriviste, touch of tar brush?  Who really cares he's a bore. Hip hop could be good on Broadway if done by Tribe called quest. This is trite and insipid like Sondheim, that rhyming dictionary slave. Sir, Burr, sir, Burr. One time OK not 20 times. Also the sad thing is that the black cast is considered  some big statement. No it's truly sad poor hispanics and Blacks had no more than a servile contribution to early USA. Why not do a musical about slaves? It's not really racial but economic. Philippa of Hainault was a black British queen. L'Enfant was the designer of DC and black. But these people lived among the elite. Discrimination has more to do with economic class. Could go on forever like the show but will spare you. PS In The Heights even more stereotypical than West Side Story.
0	Very Disappointing.  An over-engineered, over-produced piece of crap.  With a couple of brief exceptions, her wonderfully powerful voice is AWOL.  Don't waste your money!
0	Fine delivery time, no problem there. The two stars are for the music. What this has to do with bluesman Robert Johnson is a mystery to me as well as the bands on this CD.
0	I never ordered or received this item
0	That's about all there is to say.  Instead of purchasing the entire song, evidently I purchased about 97% of it.
0	this is a bad remake you have akon, lil wayne, and t pain in one song and they're all using autotune come on and oh yeah you got ll cool j, busta rhymes, and swizz beats rapping in it yes put these lame clowns in it make sure the kids dig it we'll add hip hop and autotune and put usher in it you know girls love usher add celine dion, and jennifer hudson you know she was on dreamgirls guess wyclef and lionel richie couldn't afford beyonce or was she and sasha fierce too high and mighty to participate or was she and her hubby jayhova god somewhere on the fake elysian fields pretending their zeus and hera. anyway pink's and I think miley cyrus in it withn the jonas brothers but still I prefer the old version and oh yeah for a special treat they added mj's vocals from the old 1 to make sure he didn't miss out yeah we really need this.
0	Mary needed a new sound but this ain't cutting it neither. I can hear Banks sound on "follow" & "right now" but those songs still come off as just another o.k song from mary,I can hear Robin S. style on "My Loving" o.k also,"Whole Damn Year" seems to be that cool Mary sound but it still comes off as just o.k."Nobody but you" & "picc me up" are o.k also.
0	Favourite band, awesome tracks, water-logged sleeve. I received this as gift, which I much appreciated, but due to a lack of a $0.001 plastic cover, it looks like it was dragged onto the beach at Normandy. It took forever to arrive, which would not be an issue, but since I'm here writing a review.  NO Forever!
0	Terrible cheesy song that I just had to buy to play a joke on someone.  I'll just leave it at that because you would have to have been there to get the joke.  You'll either love this song or hate it.
0	The title of this item violates Amazon's terms. How can you sell items with this filthy title?
0	Disgusting song Amazon. As a customer of yours for many years, this garbage makes me want to take my business elsewhere. I wish I could have given a negative rating.
0	I'm a huge Aydin Esen fan (starting from way back in the 80s at Berklee, Cafe Bouquet and Ryles) but this album is porqueria (pig stye, at best). Stay away if you like (or love) Jazz; this is a far cry from his better (earlier) efforts.
0	I don't like this song, and I do plan on deleting it, but I guess even so, I still have an opinion. In MY opinion, it's a single star for sure.
0	Ordered this album on two seperate occasions, back to back. this production must be a defect, because both skip in the same places.
0	I met the artist what a douche! No longer do I like his songs or him!
0	This is NOT a piece of music.  It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.  Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
0	Worst Dylan album ever!  He should have stuck with folk songs.
0	This is everything but the German rock band PUR. If you like rap you might like it, if you like PUR you will definitely not.
0	Another Mariannas trench vomit style craptasic band.  Boys like girls?  You would never say that listening to this band.
0	Here in the USA we have a populace that is excited over and over by such novelty songs about letting dogs out, warmth increasing along with clothing decreasing, beats being technotronic, detachable items, Macarena, Chicken Dances, or just repeating a thought killing mantra such as "Hey Ya." Thus, it comes as no surprise that a song that seems to be saying the following: "Open Condom Style" over and over would rise to number one . . . However, I will say that this song will please those trying to blot out their miserable slave labor existence by gathering in a mildew soaked MRSA laden gym to impress the opposite sex with gorilla-like shame inducing movements that should only be performed in your own room alone.  As a bonus, there is a "comedian" whose only "joke" is to mime a sexual act in an elevator. Every country has one; an idiotic one trick pony comedian who uses the hip thrusting joke to base his or her "comedy" act upon. I suppose this could be funny; In Korea. Here it is an act of cultural sabotage orchestrated by unthinking herds uninterested in seeking out anything that is the least bit artistic or of substance. I like how there is absolutely no personal liberty at play in the choices of millions of Americans. It certainly shows we can be readily bamboozled as a nation by any two-bit idea or scoundrel with money backing him or her. I think Korean music has much more to offer America! Why do we ignore the other music produced there? Are we really paying attention?  Dear America, please locate a better song from Korea to raise to the heights of popularity. Thanks.
0	I'm not loving her singing voice. no big deal cuz I said the same thing about Rochelle Jordan 1021 album. But RoJo got a 5 rating because she still manage to make good music. I can't say the same about this "Whispers" album. I honestly do not have a favorite song on here.
0	This album, while it does have a few decent tracks, is not a Dr Dre album. It's a compilation album of other artist. In fact, I couldn't even count on one hand the amount of times we hear Dre on this album. It's pretty pathetic that this is his "grand finale." Seems that he's overthought himself so much that he's now just relying on other artists to carry it for him and has lost himself completely in the process. Just bc he slapped his name on this weak effort does not legitimize it. Very disappointing after waiting 16 years.
0	Sounds like Wilson Phillips to me. I was expecting something edgier. I guess everyone wants to be a pop star.
0	Simply this is not the music I was expecting, it is not my style.
0	I didn't realize how derivative Bob Marley and the Wailers were.  I loved them in the 70's, but upon review, realize that almost all of their music was done better by the original artists.
0	Let me start by saying I really like this band and their music. HOWEVER, I was unbelievably disappointed with this CD. Coming from an audio engineering background(albeit 25 years ago) I was appalled with the audio quality of this recording. I was first introduced to the band by watching festival performances and a headliner concert on Palladia. I asked for the CD for Christmas since I liked just about everything I had heard from them up to this point. I  put the CD in my car and pushed play expecting to be rocking out in no time. I really thought someone had borrowed my car and blown my speakers. Even with the bass turned waaay down, it is distorted almost to the point of unlistenability if that is a word (if not, it should be). I wish I had looked at these reviews before asking for it. I will stick to listening to them on live performances where the audio isn't "tricked out" in such a horrible way. I saw in a former review that this was intentional by the producer. I hope these reviews have been seen by him and I hope he realizes the mistake.
0	Absolutely Horrible. A debauchery to Motley's Music.
0	I'm clearing off my review list. This was a purchase for someone who WANTED it. Thus, they liked it. I personally am not a fan.
0	What a con, I should have looked harder, but Amazon shows an Ablum cover, and expecting to get it all for .69 cents, you get one song.  Its deceptive, but  probably not illegal. But I don't like it, and probably will never use this site angain.
0	I was horribly disappointed by this album.  I've waited since 04 for a new album having high expectations especially after how awesome the first album was.  There is absolutely no comparison between the albums.  To be honest they might as well pull this album from shelves and rework their "original magic" because there new stuff isn't working and I'm sure others would agree.  Crossfade will always be one of my favorite bands. but maybe they just had a bad year.
0	I first bought this album when I was about 17, I'm now 52 and I love it now as much as I did then. It is one of those magical mixes that don't happen very often. Like " Hotel California" by The Eagles with Joe Walsh, or Santana Abraxas.
0	Count Basic has a great live recording of this song and that is what I thought Amazon was selling but I downloaded this twice, paid twice, and both times got the studio version, not the live version.
0	I pre-ordered this album because I was just so excited about their return from their hiatus that I didn't feel I had to hear it before I bought it.  I wanted to give this a chance before leaving my review.  I want to love this album, I really do.  But their dramatic change in their "sound" is just not what I was looking for.  The songs are pleasant and its fine to hear it on the radio as background noise.  I wouldn't change the channel, but I certainly wouldn't perk up when it comes on.  Knowing what Mumford is capable, I'm left with a profound sense of disappointment.  Their "thing" that truly made them stand out in their first two albums is gone.  I can't even listen to the album.  I had the pleasure of hearing them live a few years back and I tell you, despite how many times I'd heard all of their songs, it gives me goosebumps.  They were that amazing.  Some of you may love their new direction, but I can't say that I do.  I won't completely write them off and I will continue to enjoy the first two albums, and hope they either drop this new sound or come to a compromise with a bit of old and a bit of new for their next outing.  I won't pre-order their next album.
0	The music is fantastic, don't get me wrong. However, the copy of the record I received was very dirty and needed to be cleaned three times before I could get it to play with any sort of decent sound quality.
0	An expensive mistake!  A real disappointment but I was able to reurn it for a refund.  I was very disappointed.
0	Must be used with Amazon's "Player" only. That's what I need. another program.
0	The reason this 3 cd set was compiled is really conservationist.  The decline of New World parrots due to deforestation, capture for pets, and use for food and feathers, prompted an attempt to record and therefore familiarize conservationists with detectable and identifiable means to track and record species census counts.  All this is very well for the serious ornithologist, Neotropical birder and scientists.  For the average listener this is an exercise in unpleasant noise, stretched out for three hours and nineteen minutes.  The majority of species receive multiple recordings of perched and flight calls.  The unfortunate thing is that few of these are recognizable as patterned or unique vocalizations.  All noises made by all macaws sound alike to my ears.  All noises made by all parakeets sound alike to me, etc. etc.  Even a trained musical ear can detect almost nothing to distinguish one species from another.  So for the average listener, this becomes an unpleasant assault on the ear by loud screams, chatter and alarm notes - all made by the most unmusical group of feathered friends on the planet.  Here are 140 species - 14 macaws, 56 parakeets, 16 parrotlets and 54 parrots.  The sixteen species of parrotlets are somewhat charming- their quiet chatter is endearing rather than annoying.  There are also a few parrot species whose voices form distinct vocal patterns and/or sounds that do make them recognizable:  Blue-Headed, Blue-Cheeked, Blue-Fronted, Red-Browed, Mealy, Yellow-Lored and especially the Yellow-Crowned.  This is not a set for the average birder. At $39.95 it is a hefty price to pay for discs that can be of little interest to anyone other than the groups identified at the beginning of my second paragraph.
0	I love Sean Hayes but he gave the most wooden performance I've ever heard. He's got a great voice but there was no feeling to it. It's washed out just like the CD cover. Maybe he had a tooth ach. Still love ya Sean.
0	I pretty much think it's garbage and not country at all.

0	big letdown.  Volbeat has put out some killer songs in the past but there are very few on this album.  A lot of slower, cheesy stuff.
0	Sadly not much of Marc Bolan's classic early work is available, and this promised much, having most of the well known Tyrannosaurs Rex albums tracks, such as Unicorn, Salamanda Palaganda, Nijinsky Hind, The Wizard and more. The quality of this recording (made in Chicago, Aug 1969) is poor, it sounds as if Marc's singing through a tunnel. I'd hoped to save myself the trouble of transcribing all my LP's to CD, but my LPs have much better sound quality than this double CD set. Don't bother unless you have no other memories of the early days.
0	"Gypsy Heart" is another tired and lackluster track from Elton John's Leather Jackets album.  Mr. John's heart just isn't in this one.  He gives a straight by-the-numbers vocal, not lending any heart or soul.  This could be from any number of faceless performers and not really worthy of his greatness.
0	I'm a big fan of Lucinda Williams, and have several other cd's of hers, including Car Wheels On a Gravel Road and World Without Tears, but I regret getting this one, and won't listen to it again.  The lyrics are repetitive and simplistic, the melodies have a boring sameness about them, and it's far from her best work.  Let's hope for better next time.  She's shown she's capable of it.
0	The album is awesome but the quality of the record is terrible. It sounds like it is being played through a cell phone.
0	It is so bad I can't tell if this is a knockoff or the original artist.  If I am wrong on this let me know
0	I hate to be negative because I really enjoyed the first record and still listen to it four years later but this record is incredibly slow, incredibly somber, and incredibly sparse; it has the atmosphere of a skeletal Red House Painters record. It's basically just acoustic guitar with some light accompaniment so it feels more like a solo release than the effort of a full band. This isn't necessarily bad if it's what you're after but the record has very little variety or variability whatsoever: it starts slow and steady, it stays slow and steady, and it ends slow and steady. Even the songs that do break the 100 bpm mark maintain that Bon Iver bleakness. If you were to strip Fleet Foxes down to just a few acoustic instruments, no drums, and no vocal harmonies, you'd have this. There isn't a bad song on the record, mind you, it just never lightens up for one moment; it does not relent.  Obviously, I was expecting something completely different. Seems like a great record to play on an overcast Sunday morning while you're trying to get over a hangover.
0	thought it was with Tony Bennett since my order was for him but this was a duet with her and others but not with Tony he is not on this disk very unhappy since Streisand is not someone I really care for.
0	I like covered covers and I cannot lie. You other covers can't deny that when a song comes on with a real familiar tone and a chorus in your face, you get hung, up on the covered song 'cause you noticed that song was on. Deep in the tune I'm hearing there's an old song quite endearing. Oh JC, I wanna pay you money and buy every single CD My senses tried to warn me But that song was just stolen for TV. Ooh, Ander's smooth crew We just want credit where credit's due. "They used me, on Glee." JC's got no average groupie. They're out there chanting, Generally frantic, They're mad, sad, Saying Fox did something bad. I'm tired of magazines, Sayin' they don't get this thing Take an average person and ask them that, "Who is this JC cat?" So, Fellas! Yeah! Fellas Yeah! Has this cover been covered? Hell yeah! Tell them to stick it, stick it! Up their wealthy butt. Lea's got back. I really like that.  If you're here, then you're probably familiar with the issue. If not, please enjoy the education.  [.]  And support Jonathan Coulton here, because well, he's got back.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Baby Got Back (In the Style of Glee)</a> <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Baby Got Back (In the Style of Glee)</a>
0	This version is not from the original line-up of Sister Sledge; it's from a concert minus Kathy Sledge (the featured vocalist from the original recording).
0	I'll keep looking, but I don't seem to be able to find it on my Kindle. will keep trying. maybe I'm just looking in the wrong place.
0	family member downloaded for their mp3
0	Did not listen to the song, but I do like the song.
0	Metallica stripped of all its energy. What's next? Metal and Sebastian, the Metal's answer to Belle and Sebastian?
0	It's a totally different version of the song than what was played in the mainstream media, which was the one I wanted. I found the one I wanted in their greatest hits.
0	Very disappointing. Loved SLP but this follow up can not light a candle to it. Hope he goes back to making more real r&b music
0	The CD will not play the first few songs on it.  Troubleshooted by first testing the player, using other of my CDs and they work fine.  So, I am very disappointed with the purchase, to say the least, particularly when I chose among the highest price selections for the same CD thinking that I would get a virtually scratch-free or error free disc.  I won't be ordering anything through Amazon any time soon.
0	I don't understand how there can be so many albums titled Altar Call. I mean, why not choose an original title for your album. Also the singing is  way too nasally, and overdone. Not a fan.
0	Won't let me post it on Facebook to a video I made due to "cooyright" ugh!
0	As much as I love "This is Love", this CD is going back because it's more than obvious that it was "digitally remastered" from vinyl.  I can even hear the noise in the grooves and sounds of the stylus being lifted.  I consider that false advertising.  "Digitally Remastered" should mean that it comes from the original source of the music. I have my own vinyl copy of this album, and my CD-R sounds just as good if not better than this one.  For some stupid reason, whoever transfered this album to the CD edited the title track "This Is Love" at the 1:38 mark.  If any other reviewers want the entire (and genuinely remastered) track, get "Absolutely The Best of The Archies" on Fuel 2000.  Again, the album itself is five stars and easily the best Archies album released, but only one star for this mastering of it.  Update: It's available from iTunes.  The quality it top-notch.
0	I quite like Simple Plan's first two albums and their pop-punk-rock style. I was very disappointed with this new album. The production introduced electrocic elements and backing vocals effects in the first six songs that turned Simple Plan into Backstreet Boys.  From the seventh track (which is very good) on, I could recognize Simple Plan, but most of them are ballads.
0	When I tried to play it I realized that I was warped so it wouldn't play correctly
0	Big Mistake! How do I stop the madness? I cannot stop it from playing.
0	Barbra Streisand is the most affected singer of her time. She adores herself. Her singing is boring. She is boring and has not done anything important in 20 years. Maybe the problem is all those facelifts and botox injections. Since makes Diana Krall seem exciting. Please retire!
0	What a disappointment after English Oceans (one of my favorite albums of the last five years). I'm a long time Truckers fan-and I'm surprised by the positive reception this album is receiving.  This is a collection of 'protest songs' from the truckers with their most on-the-nose political content to date. For my personal taste, this type of music should have died with the 60s and seems out of place in 2016.  We are constantly bombarded by politicized messages on TV, social media, etc etc  and I guess I just don't need it in my music to this extent.  And yes, these guys have *always* been political, but they have usually done it through telling fictional stories with their songs.  These songs just feel like a synopsis of current events.  The songs are pretty weak lyrically and musically.  Cooley's songs are slightly more put together than Hood's.  Patterson Hood has always had a problem with being a bit too prolific for his own good and the ongoing result seems to be that we get a great record alternating with a mediocre one.  If not for English Oceans, I would really be wondering about the trajectory of this band post-Isbel.  If you are new to this band, start with literally any of the other releases.  If you're a fan this is probably a required purchase but I just don't see listening to this more than a couple times.
0	This is one great record! A must-have if you're looking for some great oldies with a sense of humor! Parodies (Leader of the Laundromat), nonsensicals (Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop), cartoons (Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron), this album has something for everyone!
0	I hate all kids bop cd's! I put 1 star but this cd dosen't even deserve 1 star! Kids bop cd's take great songs and make them sound horrible! I have always and always will hate kids bop!   You'd think maybe the kids would atleast TRY to sound good! It's like they make it sound bad on porpose! Even my singing teacher who majored in music thinks the same!  Don't waste your money on this horrible cd! Even adults should know better and most kids don't even like their songs! Don't spend your money, even litsen to the samples, they sound horrible! Thank you, I hope you don't waste your money,   Nori
0	First roar & now this stinking up the airwaves & its hitting up the charts? Will she ever go away? nice going people , You don't know what good music is anymore.
0	This is miss-labeled RAP-CRAP.  NOT Aerosmith.  What a disappointment.
0	They're songs sung near the taverns on land and have instrumental tracks in them. Give us the shanties! We want the shanties!
0	First of, John 5 is an amazing guitar player, but he is restrained to power chords on this release just like he was in Manson. But he can wail, just listen to his solo stuff. I can only assume that person didn't know much about his guitar style.   That said, his inclusion doesnt really add up to much on Educated Horses. The whole thing falls dead on its feet in under 40 minutes. I understand change and new direction but this just seems so forced and fake. The riffs are the same ol' back forth notes, with a few pretentious acoustic numbers. The cool horror film samples would have helped this album some, but not much. Get everything he has done before this, but skip the new one cause it is average at best.
0	And it's dreadful! Big klunky band, no guitar soloing through it. I can't think why they would release this, it's terrible. I should have listened to the previews before spending my 99 cents.
0	Nice jodeci sound at first but this album is still weak. Nice first verse on "She With The S." and "#Born Day" is a good club banger.
0	I'm sorry I cannot provide a review of this book because I didn't purchase it.  Apparently someone else has used my name and account to make this purchase, because I didn't buy it.
0	i did not buy this so not sure why i'm asked to rate it. Can someone explain why i have to rate it as a purchase I made?
0	The music is not so good as the other albums.  Miss the voices of Daniel Furlong or  Damian McGinty  Other albums are super
0	The vinyl arrived warped. Disappointed.
0	the amount of music is good but they are all opera based and very dull to hear i had high hopes for some of the orchestra to use some regular singers or something  Nope all opera and slow slow slow
0	I want to make sure that everyone who is thinking about buying this collection knows that these are *NOT* the original recordings!  Every song on this CD has been re-recorded.  Why do artists think that we want to hear the songs we know and love re-recorded? We don't!  I liked the original version the way it was.  Stop trying to improve on what was fine to start with!  I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy this CD.  I am just saying that if you do, be aware that these songs are not the original versions.  And while I have the floor.  I hope that someday, someone will put together an essential 2 disc collection of Eddie Rabbitt's hits that covers his years with Electra, Warner Brothers and RCA. And put all the hits on the collection!  And no live tracks and no re-records!  Just the hits the way we know them and love them.  So far the collections I've seen have been pretty pathetic.  So, maybe one day, someone will do a 2 CD set  worthy of being called The Very Best of Eddie Rabbitt.
0	Nancy Sinatra's very is OK, I just don't care for the song.
0	If you download the MP3 File software, and it doesn't work, you can't redownload the files again. This site does not work. Don't do it.  You where told.
0	Glad it was a free download, because this was all quickly deleted from my christmas song rotation. More appropriate for elevators than actual listening.
0	Chicago lays claim to the title "Kings of Might Have Been" on their first release of all-new material since 1991.  This album might have been many things:  Yet another comeback for the band that's recovered from losing its heart and soul (Terry Kath), its best known vocalist (Peter Cetera), and its longtime drummer (Danny Seraphine).  A final summing-up of an almost forty-year career of hitmaking.  A current statement on life, love, and politics from the perspective of a bunch of older guys who've been through it all but can still play, if not actually rock.  Instead the disc ends up seeming not to know what it's supposed to be - more like a Jason Scheff solo album with a guest appearance by Bill Champlin and a cameo by Robert Lamm.  It's telling that there's not a single James Pankow-penned song in the entire collection.  If you play this disc on repeat, at the end you'll hear the "horn section mix" of the first song released to radio, "Feel", immediately followed by the hornless "hot single mix" that's actually being played on the radio.  That should tell you instantly what's wrong - the radio mix is bloodless and anonymous while the horn mix actually sounds like a pretty decent Chicago tune from the current decade.  Having Robert Lamm take the lead on a single seems like a daring move, but there's little of that type of adventurousness on the rest of this release.  The early part of the album is ballad-heavy.  "King Of Might Have Been" is another song featuring Jason Scheff whining and whimpering about lost love.  Scheff seems to have the monopoly on this type of testosterone-free bleating and he does his best broken-hearted wussy act here.  The disc would have instantly been made better if this track had fallen through the cracks somehow.  Of course the band has "filled in the cracks", on "Love Will Come Back" where producer Jay DeMarcus' own band helps out by singing that unfortunate chorus, too reminiscent of grade-school adolescent "Phil McCracken" jokes to be at all enjoyable.  That's another Scheff tune that borrows entirely too much from other ballads that have traveled the same territory before.  "Why Can't We", a Bill Champlin duet with Shelly Fairchild, is similarly bland and unnecessary, seemingly included only to have a duet ballad with country crossover possibilities.  There are some positives on this album, though:  "Caroline", while cliched and not too lyrically sophisticated, is a catchy little tune that skips the whining and provides a chorus that'll play in your head a while once you've heard it.  Likewise the Scheff/Champlin tune "Where Were You", which recycles the idea behind everything from "I Honestly Love You" to "Hold On To The Nights" but does it well and, again, has a catchy chorus that will stick to your brain a while.  The two Robert Lamm compositions, "90 Degrees and Freezing" and "Come To Me, Do" get past the questionable song titles to provide two fairly interesting tracks, musically and lyrically, and make you wish Mr. Lamm was a bigger part of this release.  Instead there's another Scheff tune, "Long Lost Friend", which isn't quite as tedious as his other tracks here.  The song is more lively than the usual Scheff ballad and if it had been his only contribution to XXX it might even be somewhat praiseworthy.  Finally there are the Bill Champlin songs, "Already Gone" and "Better".  While Mr. Champlin knows how to write a bluesy, horn-drenched number that suits his voice, he has never shown a propensity for creating the type of catchy tunes that have been Chicago's bread and butter, so his material is usually, often unfairly, relegated to album filler.  These two songs are interesting enough but not his best work - for that you have to revisit his 80's work or the stuff he wrote for SOS.  "Already Gone" does have the clever "check, please" refrain, and "Better" is reminiscent of Champlin's take on "Blues in the Night" on the Big Band disc.  And "Lovin' Chains" sounds like it could be a Champlin composition though it's credited to producer Jay DeMarcus.  Again, it's solid but unexceptional.  All in all, if you've waited with anticipation since 1991's "Twenty 1" for an album of new Chicago material, you'll probably love this disc just because, well, it's an album of new Chicago material.  If you liked the ballads and don't really know or care who Chicago is or what their history might be, you'll probably love parts of this.  If you heard the late, lamented, unreleased "Stone of Sisyphus" recording in one of its many Internet-spread incarnations, you probably hoped for something more daring but you won't find it here.  And if you long for the days when James Pankow wrote hit song after hit song, and Terry Kath provided some offbeat, funky, rockin' numbers, you'll probably want to go to your music collection and re-listen to one of the first XI albums.
0	The sound technician and producer were drunk. Cutout bin material for the first two-thirds, because those were walls of noise. Actual value $2usd max.
0	If you've been searching for the songs and/or hits of the late 1950s/early 1960s Girl-Group from New York City calling themselves The Bobbettes, and you're trying to decided between the 34-track Titanic release "The Bobbettes - The Ultimate Collection) and this one, be advised that there is no contest. The Titanic volume, even with its minor flaws, is head and shoulders above this German release which seems to have been culled from a collection of 45s that were stashed willy-nilly in a drawer somewhere - and without protection - for 50 years!  While I don't normally mind the occasional snap, crackle and pop associated with old 78- and 45-rpm discs as long as it's not too pronounced (I grew up with those formats after all), this one is bottom-of-the-barrel in that respect.  For the record, the tracks are: 1. I Shot Mr. Lee; 2. Have Mercy Baby; 3. Dance With Me, Georgie; 4. Mister Johnny Q; 5. I Like It Like That; 6. Are You Satisfied (With Your Love?); 7. Zoomy; 8. Come-A, Come-A; 9. Don't Say Goodnight; 10. Speedy; 11. Billy; 12. Oh My Papa; 13. Looking For A Lover; 14. Um Bow Wow; 15. The Dream; 16. Mr. Lee; 17. You Are My Sweetheart; 18. Untrue Love; 19. I Cried; 20. Rock And Ree-Ah-Zole; 21. Look At The Stars; 22. Teach Me Tonight.  Nothing you can't get in the Titanic release, which goes out of its way to provide both versions of I Shot Mr. Lee (one for Atlantic the other for Triple X) and a number of their tracks you won't see here.
0	Very inspiring, I have downloaded it to my iPod and laptop.  My daily insiration, it encouages my walk and commitment to Christ.  Great Christmas music
0	I really do like this song however, the MP3 at 256k about ripped my head off when I played it on my "real" stereo.  Computer speakers of cheap junk ear buds only.  With real tweeters the distortion was painfully bad.  How about some WAV or at least 256K AAC+?  I hate MP3 in general as it has ruined music.  The youtube video has much better sound! Really seriously!
0	I wouldn't ever use this stuff in a live or recorded set. I suggest moving on.
0	CD was unplayable on arrival. Appears to be damaged looks cloudy and no player can read disc. The album is one of Benson's best but due to the inability to play the CD I have no choice but to rate the product poorly. Also jewel case cracked and CD not secured in case due to center "teeth" being broken off. Very unhappy with product.
0	This is either the original or a re-release of a disc that I already owned.  Returned with no problems.
0	All I can say is that if you are looking for a CD that sounds the same the whole way through this is the one for you. The first time I tried to listen to this CD my friend and I both got migranes. I have to say I like a couple of the songs on this Cd but it's not worth buying the whole CD, just get the single.
0	I loved this song growing up and i am sure Miley has no idea what a privilege she has been given to be able to cover this song.  I don't think it is horrible but i agree that it has that Disney quality to it but thats what makes my daughter love her so much.  They are trying to redirect the age audience for this song and they are doing well.  You have to figure that Cyndi gets royalties for every print of her song and is fully aware and approved this remake.
0	By far my least favorite track by Disturbed. I get that weed is legal in more and more places now but you don't need to write an entire song about it. I don't care if the song is intended to be serious or it's a parody like the supremely helpful person posting definitions as comments seems to think, it's just not a good source for a metal track. It starts with bong water sounds and then continues on to what I can only imagine is intended as a stoner anthem. I preordered the album and unfortunately had to pay for this garbage in the bargain. I know I'll be leaving the track out of my playlists.
0	I have been a pink floyd/Rodger Waters fan for 30 years . I own every floyd/ water album/cd from the beginning. I hate to say this ( I really do) this CD just is not good mostly because of #1 Waters voice is gone and #2 there's nothing new  you can exchange words from pros and cons or amused with the music. It sounds like he put this together in a day and didn't care of the results. I don't like Rodger Waters music - I LOVED  Rodger Waters music and after the 3rd time of trying to find a song I like I cant . The music its self and the musicians are good but the voice is no longer there. SORRY ALL YOU PINK FLOYD FANS (like myself) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - its better to remember the good instead of listening to this mess.
0	This album is just a little too poppy. A lot of the songs sound almost exactly the same. Best songs 1. Fat Lip 2. Rhythms Decent song 1. Never wake up The rest of the songs [aren't good].
0	The sound might be amazing but the content is mighty amazingly messed up. In case you care to think about the lyrics:  [Verse 1] Robert's got a quick hand He'll look around the room He won't tell you his plan He's got a rolled cigarette Hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid Yeah, he found a 6-shooter gun In his dad's closet Hidden in a box of fun things And I don't even know what But he's coming for you Yeah, he's coming for you  [Hook] All the other kids with the pumped up kicks You better run, better run, outrun my gun All the other kids with the pumped up kicks You better run, better run, faster than my bullet  [Verse 2] Daddy works a long day He be coming home late Yeah, he's coming home late And he's bringing me a surprise Cause dinner's in the kitchen And it's packed in ice I've waited for a long time Yeah, the slight of my hand Is now a quick pull trigger I reason with my cigarette And say your hair's on fire You must have lost your wits  Just like Art - some things are pretty but obscene and disturbing.  Think about it - If a picture/piece of art of a kid with a gun in his hand shooting 'cool' kids in school was in your house, in your car, hanging around your neck when you walk through the street. what would people think? Pretty nasty and awful right? Yep - just like the song glorifying someone who fantasizes about/makes real - the song is not clear - slaughtering those folks that he thinks are cooler than he is.  Not for me - I really wish this song had different lyrics because it is super slick otherwise.
0	Seems to need some arranging or something. Lacks any artistry.  We all already appreciate the "plain"versions.
0	I've never written an Amazon review before, but this album was so bad that it became my duty to warn everyone. Do not buy this album. Put your head in a microwave and listen to the buzz. It's a far more appealing sound.
0	I tried, my kids tried. maybe I expected too much. I might give it one more chance. wait. no I won't. It sucks. period
0	It shows the one from Diplomat and the one received was from Peter Pan.
0	About once a year, I get this CD out and try once more.  I love Christmas music, lullabies, and Shawn Colvin, but this album just doesn't work for me.  I think it's because she doesn't really do anything new or interesting with the music and her voice sounds (IMHO) *too* bare and stripped down- like a 12-year-old girl singing Christmas music to herself.  I got bored/frustrated with track after indifferent-sounding track.  This one's going to the Goodwill this year.  For what it's worth, I have three other Shawn Colvin albums and love songs like "Shotgun Down the Avalanche" and "Round of Blues".  I just think the girlish lilt and untrained nature of her voice seem to work better with her own compositions.
0	Would prefer an all gospel song as opposed to the mixture of secular and contemporary Christian
0	I haven't seen "Rhythm of the Rain" in the oldies collections hawked on TV and this CD seemed the only way to get that song. The rest of the music on this CD is forgettable.
0	This is a very tiresome rehash of early Beatles outtakes appearantly sourced from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Unsurpassed-Masters-Vol-1-1962-1963/dp/B0009MD506/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Unsurpassed Masters Vol. 1 (1962-1963)</a>&nbsp;with a few Out-takes from their solo albums, and an Ed Sullivan Show number. Unless you just *have* to have the solo numbers, product like this should be avoided. This bootleg brings little (if anything) that is new, previously unreleased, or 'rare.' It's a re-hash of previously released bootlegs that 'any Beatles collector' even one from 'Noo Zilland' should recognize as a rip-off. Bootleggers have been robbing fans blind for years repackaging previously released material, as noted in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bootleg-The-Secret-History-of-the-Other-Recording-Industry/dp/0312142897/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bootleg: The Secret History of the Other Recording Industry</a>&nbsp;and this is another example of it. Buy the 8 volumes of the Unsurpassed Masters series if you don't have it already- it's all Core Collection material straight from the 2nd generation reels, and avoid this turkey- it should have been subtitled "Hashed and Re-Hashed".
0	A chair, a rope, and a tree branch is funnier than this disloyal hack.  Derosa can't shine the shoes of real comedians.  His blatent misogyny and racism throughout just shows his unoriginal style and delivery.  Shame that a 1 star rating is required.  0 stars, all day.
0	I love this music and artist.  I bought this because it was described as a cd. It is a cassette tape. I left this message with the seller but they gave no explanation. I would not have bought this as a cassette tape as I already have The original cassette that I purchased it from the artist Oman Ken.
0	This is the original German version and should be noted as such.  Guess I should have listened to the 30 second sample first.
0	exellent recording and I would recommend it to all people who enjoy classical ,music. the artistry is great and needs to be heard.
0	this is a wonderful CD as far as the music goes, however, Amazon has a policy of not returning defective items after a certain period.  As time went on, this CD began skipping and just got worse.  then it became too late to return or exchange it.  Amazon needs more flexibility on returning items.  This item arrived perfectly but obviously was defective to become unplayable so quickly.
0	I'm a Patton Oswalt fan so I feel I have a good foundation of his material and sense of humor.  I was extremely disappointed with this effort from him.  It wasn't very funny and he's typically very funny.  I would buy one of his other offerings instead.
0	What has happened to music. Why is it that some 17 yr old kid can get his childish noise on the radio while every day great music goes unheard. Why, cause just like everything else artistic its run by a bunch of ppl with no taste telling us what to buy.
0	These aren't even all "one-hit wonders." Cuts 1 and 3 were both written by Joe South, who had many, many hits, as did Lynn Anderson. Skeeter Davis, Mary Wells, Eddie Holman, B.J. Thomas, The Diamonds, and The Marcels all had more than one hit, and none have been forgotten by time.
0	The very first thing I recognized about this LP (yes, it was an LP when I first heard it in 1976) was that Getz was not right. "The Sound" simply was not there. But, I loved Joao so much that I devoured "Ligia", and "Eu Vim da Bahia" and tried to ignore that Stan was slumping. "Double Rainbow" is a wonderful tune, and, again I simply tried to ignore Heloisa Buarque's occasional foray into off-key and Getz' muddled production in order to get to Joao's wonderful high-fretboard work to the ending. Still, over the years I went to the LP in order to learn the tunes - and then one day I found Joao had a CD of most of the same tunes ALL BY HIMSELF. This was, to me, the clue that he was not at all satisfied with the recording either. His CD is flawless and 5 star. This one I do give a few stars simply for "Ligia" and "Falsa Bahiana" where Getz at least gets a few off. The original liner notes were written by Gene Lees, and he, too, must share some blame for touting so loudly what is clearly a sub-par recording.
0	I received two disks, one marked disc 1 and one marked disc 2, but they each had the same music on them.  So disappointing!  Then I read that I can't return it. Amazon, this is defective product, it should be replaced!
0	I love Stevie Nicks. however, this CD is unlistenable.  The songs should go back into her vault. and stay there.  The songs were horrible.  Sorry Stevie.  I thought that I would love it. as I have everything else that she has ever recorded.
0	This was the third CD this lady released after escaping the Ayatollahs. The previous two being Zartosh ( with lyrics by her ex husband, film director Kimiaii) and Manifest (written by the same team as this album).  I am posting the review I did of Manifest when it was originally released. Now that some time has gone by, in retrospect, I must add that the album is poorly mixed and engineered. It just doesnt sound powerful enough. Even though the album feauters a full orchestra, the arrangements are very poorly written. It makes a full orchestra sound worst than a keyboard.  Now heres my review, which was published originally when the album came out:  1) Ay Mardom Mordam  This song is a CLASSIC and absolutely perfect. The melody and chorus, the part that says: "Ay mardom, mordam." is absolutely brilliant, memorable, original and fit Googoosh's voice like a glove. The use of a real drummer gives the song the added strength that its lyrics demand! The lyrics are very important and up to date, in line with the realities of Iranian women today.  2) Nejaatam bedeh  This ballad starts with a beautiful string (violins) arrangement. Given that expensive string sections are usually not usually employed in making Iranian music abroad these days, it is great to hear strings in this production.  A beautiful vocal melody starts. The lyrics are again great and very important. I personally feel very close to the feeling of "wanting to be saved" which the lyrics talk about.  However, what could have been another classic, given the strong verse parts, doesn't quite become one, because it needs a strong chorus sung in high notes. The song writer does realize that such a part is needed and attempts with the part that has the lyrics going: "Nabaayad bezaarim setaareh." Unfortunately this part is not measure up to the brilliance of the verse.  Still the verse and the lyrics are so great that they makes this a memorable song anyway.  3) Esgh Yani Hame Chiz  More string section here! Absolute brilliant. lyrics, saying "You are not alone. Who do you think all these stars in the sky belong to?" and "Thinking of freedom is living". Music wise, this song succeeds completely, as the strong verse leads to a surprising and unexpectedly fun and refreshing bridge/chorus that starts with the lyrics "nagoo maa dotaa kamim."  Brilliant. and a classic!  4) Sangar bi Sang  Googoosh is able to save this song because she is able to sing low notes very well. This song is musically OK. The only memorable line "kaash bar migashtam" is too short to make up for the rest of the song.  5) Khoobe khoob  This is an embarrassment! The lyrics are absolutely horrible: "bas keh midoonam khoobe khoobee, khaabi khaabi, man keh bidaaram, cheghatdr khoobeh". It turns out that a similar song belongs to Shahriar. The music is dull.  6) Ghazal Shishehee ( Fragile Melody)  So far the album has offered slow songs. This one is the first upbeat song - something the album desperately needs. This song has a disco beat, with the brilliant idea of contrasting the upbeat drum programming with a loud electric guitar playing the main arrangements. The vocal melody for the verse is great because the listener instantly feels like singing along with Googoosh.  The lyrics are clever and create great, educated images. The vocal melody has a climax that starts with the part: "Baa to zolaal mishavam.". The only problem is that the song needs a middle section that is as brilliant as the rest. The songwriter again knows a part is missing and attempts with the section that goes: "Dar ghafass-e abri." but it's just not as memorable as it should be.  But anyway, the melody of the first verse is so beautiful that makes this song well worth it. Also, it is pleasant that they have taken some risks with this song. Googoosh sounds wild - like she should! Her voice comes alive. It definitely sounds like no other record.  7) Aftabi  This one is also upbeat. It has a very marked "Mehrdad" quality to its melody. It runs smoothly and the lyrics "Aftaab hanooz ziaad miaad" is nice and tries to make the listener feel good. It has a short but sweet chorus with nice lyrics. It's a cool light song. In other words, it's pleasant but two years from now you are not going to be singing it. You may still be repeating: "Ay mardom mordam"!  8) Shenaasnaameye Man  This duet with Mehrdad starts with a rather dull arrangement. It is upbeat. "Vatan chieh, vatan kieh, laalaayee bacheghiyeh". Good lyrics. Unfortunately the music sounds a bit too generic Mehrdad. It doesn't suit Googoosh's voice either. Sounds better on Mehrdad. No chorus. This song seems to be what was supposed to be called "Khalij-e Fars". Still, great lyrics and the music is not too bad.  Packaging and jacket (0 out of 1 point)  The design and picture chosen for the front jacket are absolutely horrible. I don't know why Googoosh's jackets are always so lame. The same thing happened with her last two albums, "Zartosht" and "Akharin Khabar". The most boring picture has been chosen, then her name is repeated, which is annoying given that the album is a "Manifest" and trying to make a statement. Googoosh's name only appears in English text. An Iranian design should have been added. The white background is awful and doesn't match her clothes.  Also other big name artists in the Iranian market are starting to release their CDs with accompanying DVD of music videos, as an incentive for people to buy legal copies as opposed to downloading illegally from the net. It's a bit disappointing that they didn't do this with Googoosh. The rest of the CD package is not great either, with pictures from a single session taken indoors.
0	i don't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of Dolly Parton's song. She oversang and it's just kind of an annoying song to sit through. what a drag.
0	It's ok, but I would not have purchased it if I had listened to it first.  The songs all sound the same.
0	I mistakenly thought this was the original T Rex on vocals and not a re-recording.
0	Last time I buy anything on Amazon until this crap is taken down. Just lost a lot of respect for this site
0	WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!? When I first started listening to Jewel, she was an inspiration, she was famous and a well-respected artist, and nothing about her was manufactured. She was a breath of fresh air. Now, she has become everything I prayed she never would. How can people say that it is "brave" of her to do what will bring her the most money nowadays? In what universe is that brave? What would have been truely brave is if she had continued to refuse to be everything Hollywood tried to make her to be, and if she had just continued to be herself. Her music then was beautiful and MEANINGFUL. Now is just has a background beat. We all loved her then, what happened?
0	I don't like the remix too much. I prefer the original song.
0	I have long been a kd lang fan, from the very first song I heard her sing.  Didn't matter what she was singing - I could listen to her voice all day long.  I had planned to buy "Sing It Loud," and had plans to attend her concert July 4th in Binghamton NY.  I didn't quite like the snippets I had heard of "Sing It Loud," but so enjoy Ms Lang's singing that I thought I would give this new stuff a chance.  Consequently I was thrilled to be able to tune in to Jimmy Kimmel Late Night to hear her sing something from Sis Boom Bang Sing It Loud.  She performed "Sugar Buzz," and something else that I didn't catch the name of.  Both pieces were AWFUL, I mean just absolutely awful!  NOt music,but noise, and rather horrid noise at that.  Like kd lang meets Alice Cooper for a cat fight.  Ms Lang wasn't singing  - she was talk-screaming, there was absolutely NO melody to be found, and there is absolutely no way to describe the band other than raw and amateurish and totally out of sync with each other and Ms Lang.   Consequently, I will NOT be buying "Sing It Loud," and I have cancelled my travel plans to the July 4th performance.   I saw a video of an interview Ms Lang did with Dame Edna.  When asked what she wants for her future, Ms Lang said she'd still like to be singing into her 70's and 80's.  I fear that if Ms Lang continues on the track that she has started with this band and this album, she will ruin her voice, lose her fan base, and see a very early end to her career before she gets much into her 50's.   My advice is to listen to a little bit of these songs, and if you have the LEAST suspicion that you don't like it - don't buy it.  It doesn't get better.
0	Luckily I got this used for cheap. Half the songs are remakes by some session band, probably called "original artists",  JUNK.
0	Poorly recorded in a rush.  Trying to copy Bruce, is a terrible idea.  Mediocre at best.  Just like all his other albums.
0	Standard sung standardly, with a curious lack of emotion.
0	The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
0	I love this song, BUT, the recording was garbled and didn't sound right at all. I'm not happy about this.  I waited a while to finally download it on my MP3 player only to have a bad sounding recording.  Doesn't happen often.  I don't want to have to download it again.  The song is still great though.  All the other songs on my MP3 sound just fine.  Don't know what happened with this.
0	To think I sold my old cd to get the "better" sounding "remastered" version with extra tracks!  2 stars because even without the bonus tracks which in this case doesn't help the cd at all, this is actually quite a good album; I also got the cassette when this came out and quite frankly, even the cassette sounded better than this!  The sound quality is very, very poor so I'd recommend if you haven't already got this, to wait for another better remastered version or even get the original untouched cd if you can still find it as there is really no noticeable difference.  Perhaps if there is a well produced "Best of" compilation, that may be a good idea to get too especially to get "Do You Believe In Love" as well which I still think is their greatest hit ever.  I wonder if I can sell this cd too. Hmm.
0	I bought this CD because the "Luther" theme song was on it.  Sorry, maybe it's a good CD, but it's very much not my style of music.  It is in my trash bin.
0	I love Terrance and his acting is superb.  He just can not sing but he can really play the guitar.  I paid 13.00 for the CD and there were only 2 songs i played a little.  I enjoyed the spanish type song.  Maybe if he was able to sing more soulful. Anyway don't pay the CD, but I love you Terrance you are one of my fav actors.
0	I love the music on this CD, and have in the many editions I've purchased over the years.  My beef is with 1.) The sonics on this new (and poor sounding) remix, and 2.) the five (yes five) chosen-for-artisitic-reasons edits that were in the original mixes that were ignored when the remix was put together, meaning now we get to hear "warts" that could easily have been worked around, just as they were on the previous mix.  (The painfully obvious one:  the wrong bass note at 2:24 in Corcovado.)  If you listen on a boom box or iPod, the new CD will prove to be a perfectly fine source.  If you listen critically, stick with the previous CD issues.  The convenience of a single disc here is a nice feature, but the sound?  Not so much.
0	THIS IS A ROTTEN THINK TO DO - DON'T SELL A SONG THAT WILL NOT DOWNLOAD! VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED.
0	The clip is so soft it's hard to hear. Big bummer because I love this song but have to blast it to hear it and then it screws up the rest of my songs. :(
0	downloaded for a friend. not my thing
0	Bought this as a gift for a Willie Nelson lover. Ot came without a title on the front cover. Very cheap looking. Similar to a bootleg you might find on a table on a busy N.Y. street sold by lord knows who. Hopefully the music is ripped well.  I'll update if it's any good but if the inside is poor quality like the outside back it goes!
0	Purchased the songs and they won't play, sucks
0	My son became terrified after listening to this cd.  I am not sure if the chimes in the background were new sounds.  Days later he is still affected- crying a lot and saying he never wants to do meditation again.  I am sad that I exposed him to it.
0	I have been loyal to Trent Reznor and his NIN projects, but this is by far a big dissapointment.  Thank goodness it was reasonably priced. I just don't find this groundbreaking at all. More canned music.  If your strapped for cash, skip this album.  Get a good one like the downward spital, or broken
0	Free download.  kinda blah, but can't resist free.  lol
0	Simon & Garfunkel would set both the folk and pop/rock worlds on their ear. This album, although pleasant in parts, is an inasupicious introduction and only mildly hints at what was to come. Paul & Art were both college students, after scoring a minor hit as Tom & Jerry in 1957. Paul was ocasionally selling songs for the Brill Building as well as his own, taking legthy sabatacals to England to play and write. They reformed later and were signed to Columbia to cash in on the burgeoning folk movement spearheaded by Dylan. Although Simon was already writing, this album is mostly cover songs; some standard folk tunes ("Peggy-O", "Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream"), some spiritual tunes ("You Can Tell the World", "Go Tell It On the Mountain". kinda odd from a couple of Jewish guys), the then obligatory Dylan cover, and a madrigal ("Benidictus". Simon's British influence here). Simon's songs were represented, but certainly not his best work. "He Was My Brother" is a bit heavy handed, and the title track is, well. filler. However, the future was hinted at with the beautiful "Bleeker Street" and the original version of "The Sounds of Silence". The performances are quite good, with just their voices and their pristine vocals carrying the tracks, although in some cases the performances were a bit too eager and heavy handed. Although the exquisite harmonies are here, Simon's guitar playing is almost too straightforward. Simon would later become a much better (and highly underrated) guitarist. The album holds its place in time well. much like what you would hear in a Grenwich Village folk club in the early 60's. For that alone, it's worth purchasing to any serious folk music student. However, 40 years on, it has that "you had to be there" feel to it. Not a bad album by any means, but certainly not the first to purchase by them.
0	So KALEIDOSCOPE SKIES is cheesy; let's get that out of the way. It's earnest and poppy and slightly ridiculous, but it's still pleasant. But the rap vocals on the "Radio Dance Edit" and the "Club Mix" only makes things go from ridiculous to embarrassing, not to mention that the club and dance utility of the tracks seem limited, at best. Luckily, the one-two punch of "I Pull My Gun Once" and "I Pull My Gun Twice" bring back the beats, without too much of the rock guitar that muddied the works on the album versions.
0	No they were very used and all of them were used and I was told that one set was at least new and they were not the ones that I wanted
0	Don't judge an album by it's cover, this sampler will not launch satellites. It is useful for scaring hitchhikers and generally disrupting main street as I cruise on through in my Ford Festiva that has a sub pack worth more than the car. I just wish it launched satellites.
0	While the package does not say so, this is not the original version - a very poor cover at worse;  waste of money
0	This is the first Chante Moore CD I've ever purchased.  And I did so based on her R&B Divas' performances.  But the CD was disappointing and sounded more like Chante-lite.
0	It's such a shame. I really like The Pennywhistlers, but this recording is a disaster! They evidently just took a VERY tired old vinyl recording and ripped it to a CD. . no remastering . no processing . no click removal . nothing. Since it is so full of clicks and pops it could not even be normalized. The music level is well below the noise level. It's very hard to listen to. It sounds much like heavy sleet hitting a window with a quiet music background. Awful!
0	2014 Forest Hills Drive is by far one of my favorite albums I've listened to and I reccomend the music to anyone. So because I loved the album, I decided to order a vinyl version to listen to on my record player. Got here very quickly and everything initially seemed great but when I played it, tracks started skipping to the point where you cannot listen to the vinyl as it repeats a verse over and over again and then skips straight to the chorus. I cleaned my record player and played other vinyls I have and none have the same problem. Very disappointed. Getting a replacement and hoping that it was just my copy that had the problem.
0	All these new guys sound the same, bad voices made worse by a little machine.
0	This song is terrible. Absolutely terrible. And it is not a country song in any way shape or form.  The 5-star reviews for this song seem to be made by shill accounts. Most of them are just a few words long which hardly qualifies as a review. It's just a blatant attempt to pump of the rating for the song.  I really can't understand how a record label can release a song like this in the country format. And the fact that any country radio station would play this is proof that radio stations will play any garbage the labels tell them to play. The might very honestly be the worst song I've heard on country radio. Maybe there is a worse one but I can't think of it. Not even Cowboy Troy has recorded a song as bad as this one.
0	I used to be a John Mayer fan. This song alone has put an end to that. I'd rather have random tracks by Barney the purple dinosaur piped directly to my brain for a solid 24 hours than ever hear this song again. The one-line lyrics are nearly as appealing as a jackhammer going off next door at 1 AM except that they'll still sneak into your house over the radio after you shut the window. The music is slightly less monotonous, but nowhere near enough to salvage this train wreck. The only reason this garbage ever made it onto the airwaves at all is because it has a name like "John Mayer" attached to it. The random sing-song of your average 6 year-old produces a more meaningful and interesting musical presentation.
0	The title is the best part. George Clinton could have done so much with this theme, but he was either intellectually exhausted, too strung out on drugs, or both, and so the album is a late-70s high-school student's version of a decade earlier Funkadelic.
0	In the last cut: "Louder Than Words", there is a line than pretty well summarizes this whole album - "But we're here for the ride".  Sadly no one is driving and they are simply coasting on past laurels.  This is what old, creatively depleted and bored musicians looking to wring the last dollars out of a tired franchise produce.  In the same song, the only one with lyrics ( Roger where are you?) they sing - "With world weary grace, We've taken our places".  Sadly they have, but I would have expected more from one of the most influential bands in rock history to close their final chapter. This album has only one redeeming value: it is an effective cure to insomnia.
0	I am so very disappointed with this album. I have really enjoyed all of Hollywood Undead's other work but this album just lacked punch. "Day of the Dead" is a great single and should have been the setup for a great hard-hitting album from these guys but here i am trying to think of another compliment to give this album. The whole feel of this album is particularly commercial and feels like it came out of some executive's office and not at all from the band. I will be weary if/when their next album comes out.
0	It's such a good idea that it never ocurred to me that it would be so poorly done. The music is korny and the information no more revealing than any of the larger, more touristy and commercial organizations. I wanted "insider" information that would take me off the trail to a less crowded, more Hawaiian, Hawaii. Needless to say, it did not deliver.
0	Get the album is you like the sound of wild howler monkey's yelling about some made up bearded dude in the sky.
0	Am a big fan of this group, having bought all their prior albums and seeing them live. Sadly this latest album is not their best effort. Track 11-Bad Reputation, has been issued before and appears to be inserted as an album filler here. The only tracks worthwhile, in my opinion, are 10-Real Bad Woman and 7-Black Eyed Mary; tracks consistent with their style of blues. Will hope their next effort will be better. In the meantime I'll just be content to listen to their "old" stuff; great house-rockin' dancing blues.
0	put your hand in da air, put your hand in da air, say yea, say yea, say we'z in the house, say we'z in the house. and you wonder why i gave it a bad rating? its amazing this Repetitive stuff sells!
0	Typical weak album by the band's later work.
0	this version is very, very long. Like all of 5 minutes. That is why I purchased the 2nd one.
0	Nothing sadder than hearing someone overreaching in order to make their rendition of a a beloved traditional song sound "unique." These are not the songs a wise musician wants to "make their own."  Yuck! There are so many fine renditions of these songs; these just set your teeth on edge. Like so much of pop "sacred" music, this stuff screams "it's all about me!"  UPDATE: Yeah - my bad, giving it the 5 stars. An error. I'd like to think it's an error subconsciously motivated by my positive nature. Then again, I may have just flaked out. It's been corrected.  The review stands; just because our friends and family vary in their tastes, I kept this in the playlist we've been playing around the house during the season, daily and when entertaining. The consensus is all but unanimous: a very bad rendition. Fortunately, it's just one file among scores of others.
0	I'd rather listen to the sounds of 2 fat men having sex in Dolby TrueHD. I am ashamed that I paid for this.
0	I thought I was going to receive all three CD's in the set.  I only received one.  This particular one I received was songs I did not care for.  I went back to look at the original ad and it did say they only offered one of the three.  Oh well.  For only one CD the 26 dollars is over priced.  The other sellers were offering all three for a little more.  In the future, read carefully.  Ha.
0	I have bought records for 99 cents dated back to the 1970's COVERED in scratches. This one had a few minor scratches, considered it fine, but the whole thing skips entire parts of "Tear in My Heart". And a few more. Really disappointing. The album is one of the best I've heard in a long time, I was so looking forward to getting this vinyl in LP. I love Twenty One Pilots, but I DO NOT love this record and the person that sold it to me.
0	What a stupid song. Who cares if this twit writes any ones name? I wish I had the money the record companies have given to have radio stations flood the airways with this rubbish twice every hour, that way I could pay them off to never play it again and stop having it shoved down everyones throat every 30 minutes if they have no choice of what radio station is being played where they work, or whatever situation people may be in where it's forced on you. What a terrible, TERRIBLE, horrible untalented annoying song it is.
0	On my computer, at least the file had so much static that I barely could recognize the piece.
0	Voice sounds bizarre with the music. I don't like this song.
0	NOT THE SOUNDTRACK.  oh well, just wasted $5
0	I don't really ever write reviews but this listing, even the used version I purchased is not even the right pressing as listed. This is of course an orange record
0	Couldnt get CD to work at asll on two different CD players
0	But I got an email asking me to review Tha Carter III book which they say I purchased from Amazon.com on 10/18/09.  BUYERS BEWARE!  I don't know what's going on but I hope to find out.  I haven't even accessed Amazon.com in well over 2 years!
0	Occasional (just a few but enough to keep you awake if you are trying to drift off) popping noises and brief seconds where there is no sound occasionally. Only found this with his recordings and I have not tried them all. Wish I could "return" this purchase as I won't be listening again. :/
0	I DONT KNOW WHY THIS IS EVEN ON MY LIST OF ITEMS I HAVE BOUGHT BECAUSE I DID NOT BUY THIS GOD WITH A TITLE LIKE THAT I WOULD NOT EVER BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS. NOT SMILING! :p(
0	If you are thinking that you are ordering some obscure, unreleased songs by the great shoegazer band, Lush, you are wrong.  Emma and Miki are not back, instead, a lame emo band has commandeered the name.  Unfortunately, when I ordered this, I didn't have the opportunity to review it and [.] had listed it with the good Lush.  Since I was out $[.], and it would cost me $6 to send it back for a refund (it was sent via super saver shipping with another disc), I decided to give it a spin-what a disappointment.  They sound like they are trying to mimic one of the 90's bands like Sponge or Our Lady Peace, with a hint of 311, but don't come close to any of those bands.  The singing is bad, the rhythm section is bad and the songs are bad.  I will give them credit, the guitars are distorted, the only thing, other than the name, that they have in common with the real Lush.
0	There is only the first verse of two on this version of the song.
0	5 stars for the album, 1 star for the vinyl pressing of the album. I have bought and received two different copies of this vinyl and both have been nearly unlistenable due to awful crackling/scratching/popping throughout the album. I am anal about cleaning my vinyls and stylus before and after every listen.  Edit: I have returned for now a third vinyl record, which is still a terrible pressing. I saw another reviewer has had the same issue. It's pretty sad the record company would put out such a bad product of what is a pretty great album. Changing to one star
0	It's not as good as I thought it would be. So far I have only listened up to track 15 and thought there were only 4 good songs the rest were mediocre.
0	This is an incredibly depressing CD.  I bought as a gift to give someone some laughs fortunately I listened to it first.  It is very depressing and has no comedic value.  DO not buy!
0	Not one sound comes out of it. Total waste of money and did nothing to solve the annoying dog barking. Save your money! Neighbor has tried and my kids have came over to check it and NOTHING! Wish I had known what a waste of money but oh yeah I got FREE shipping!
0	Hey guys. Howard Tuttleman here. I don't know a whole lot about this hip-hop/rap thing, but I here this guy I know named Joe saying words from it a lot. They are always some kind of threat or put-down. I'm not always sure what to say about this rapping-music, but I guess I can appreciate it because basically ANYBODY could play it, no matter how bad of a singer you are. Heck, 50-Cent was a criminal and even HE made a record. The idea I get of rap is that you think about how you feel and just sort of talk-it-out and try to make it rhyme. At first I really liked this concept because you could pretty-much SAY whatever you want, and if you can't sing-out those high notes, or if your voice cracks a lot, you have nothing to worry about. You just talk-it-out. Most people I know are pretty-good at talking. So I thought "Wow! This is music for the common-man." But then I started to hear what they were REALLY using this medium for. Talking about yourself to try to level yourself up, and dishing out threats of violence or death to the other rappers who are trying to level-up. A viscious-circle.  Now that would be just fine if they were just talking-around for a joke, but these guys actually shoot at each-other sometimes, and a few have even died about it. This in-turn makes them more famous, but doesn't that seem like a big-price to pay for fame and fortune?  Now my best solution would be that they should stop trying to yell bad things at each-other, get to know each-other a little better, and maybe sort out their problems over dinner or coffee or something. They should leave the guns at home, too. Then, once they get to know each other they could bring their better attitudes to their songs.  I mean, they're all in the same business togeter and doing well for themselves. Why not throw out compliments instead of insults? Encouragment instead of threats? This would make the music a lot more accessible to the general-public who can't relate to killing their colleagues. It would also create a sort of web-of-trust between artists.  I would really like to hear some rapping on the radio along the lines of "Hey there, good job on your last single. It had a good beat, keep up the good work, guy," directed at another rapper. It would make the other rapper more comfortable, so he might even make HIS next rap something like "Hey, thanks man! I like your style too. We should hang-out more. How's tha family?" Or just a general compliment like "Hey, Nike's huh? I like Nike too. Where'd you get those ones? Hope you got a good deal, man". They could make it all rhyme of course, in their own special ways.  And as far as rappers telling everyone that they are the best-ever, and how everyone else is terrible, they could show a little modesty once in a while. For example, why not be more like "Hey, I'm pretty confident about my music, but their is always room for improvment. I always strive to be the best, but don't get me wrong, these other guys are really good and you should check them out too". Or maybe something like "Hey, did you hear this other guy's album? It's so good that it inspired me to do better. You guys should really hear it". You know how happy that would make the other guy? This could solve a lot of the violence problems between rappers, and could possibly prevent deaths. Just a few simple steps in commom-curtiousy.  Now I'm not suggesting that ALL of these guy get along or whatever. I mean, some people just don't get along with each-other. However, instead of talking about how you hate them, you could be a little less hostile about it. Maybe something like "Hey, to be honest I didn't really dig your new record. But it might not have been your fault. Your band might have been playing the wrong chords or something. You should come over some time and maybe I could give you a few pointers and take you out to dinner". If he handled it like that, the other guy could very well be like "Thanks for the offer. I'm not really a big fan of yours, but you seem like a good guy. What's your screen-name? We should talk more". Do you see what this could do for the music-industry!?  Now these are just a few ideas I've had, and you can throw in yours if you'd like. Like I said, I'm pretty new to this genre of music and maybe there is still something I'm not understanding. It's just that I've heard some of these threats and put-downs and thought how crazy that would be if say, the guy from Metallica sang about how much he hated the guy from U2, and started a blood-feud. Or if like, Tom Petty shot the guy from Weezer to death. That just wouldn't make ANY sense to rock-fans, but somehow this has become the norm in Rap-Music.  I even heard that some of the rockers even DO make songs for each-other. Apparently David Bowie made a song called "A Song For Bob Dylan". AND IT'S NICE. He doesn't make fun of him or threaten to kill him. Imagine that. Let me know what you guys think. Later.  howardtuttleman.com
0	This seems to be an unused orchestral soundtrack. I can see why it wasn't used. it doesn't really capture the feel of the film.  The film feels like the writer studied FLASH GORDON comics, then took some. illegal substances, before writing the film. The synth rock soundtrack in the film fit quite well.  This soundtrack seems like they were trying to do JOHN WILLIAMS STAR WARS, with nowhere near enough time, or money. Also for no apparent reason, there is another soundtrack added to the CD from some horror film.
0	This makes no sense. Note to God is not an original song from Charice. The song is from JoJo's album The Highroad that came out in 2006. For Charice to say this is her song and not expect people to know its not makes no sense. I am a very big fan of Jojo but not so much of Charice anymore.
0	Wow. This isn't a song. I could make this song in 5 or so mins. Its all just using the program called reason. Its just so annoying! Im sick of hearing it everywhere! Shouldnt even get one star!
0	Some really choice nugs, some very boring tracks.
0	Where did Jewel go?  This isn't her.  Sounds more like Madonna in the 80's but this is 2004!  No wonder I hadn't heard of this CD until browsing Amazon.  I just hope Jewel comes back as herself sometime soon.  Yuck, Yuck, Yuck!
0	I tried to download "Forever" by Little Steven & the Disciples of Soul, and through a very deceptive listing accidentally downloaded this very substandard cover version. It's not the .99 cents that was stolen from me that I am worried about. It's a local bar band cheating people by listing the original artist as the performer when they know perfectly well they've never been in a studio with Little Steven.
0	I can't seem to get it onto my phone, which is my music player. So, this is useless to me.
0	I know the song is great but I have not been able to get it to work yet from Amazon Not too happy
0	This cd was poor quality and I could not send it back fast enough.  It skipped and had blank spots.  It was an import. I did get my money back with no hassle.
0	The review for the music is spectacular. The bad thing is my computer virus software said it contained a Trojan virus.  Should I delete it?
0	I had originally thought I had purchased the full length remixes of this song. Lo and behold when I got it,it was only 2 songs and short versions! Needless to say,I'm VERY disappointed with this purchase.
0	This is a beautiful piece of classical music. YoYo Ma's does a beautiful job of playing the piece on his cello. I would have given it five stars, but Amazon's MP3 file is truncated near the end. I have downloaded the file more than once and both copies were truncated. Not having ever heard this piece before, I can't say whether this abrupt ending is intentional or not. If any one else is familiar with this piece let me know and I will correct this review.  As a side note, Amazon does not make it very easy to report a defective MP3 download. In the case of this tune I believe the copy on their server is defective. I have submitted a complaint to their help desk. We shall see what happens. I have asked Amazon to either offer a corrected full version, or refund my 99 cents.
0	I thought this was the ORIGINAL Flock of Seagulls song "I Ran" but instead this track was from some other imposter. Are fake tracks like these running rampant on Amazon?
0	You have heard this stuff already if you listen to radio friendly garbage over the last 10 years.  Don't touch this trash with a ten foot pole. you have been warned.
0	Sorry, I love music and I love different stuff.  I don't even mind cursing in an album that is not Christian, I just delete the song. However, I do have trouble if it IS a Christian dude.  He has many followers that are Christian and I was just bummed.  The naked lady drawing in the liner notes too was not in my taste.  I am sure many will like this.  I am not trying to comment on the music or anything.  I just know others will be bummed too.
0	Lisa, PLEASE go back to doing adult albums. There's tons of mediocre artists for children, but only one of you!
0	There is no question when it has came down to Katy Perry, she has definitely been known more for trying to be a pussycat in music, than trying to ignite with sex appeal in voice. She shown that shallowing down with her marriage Russell Brand ending late last year. But her trying to get back into music with her next album, doesn't seem like a far cry, it feels more like a waste to the ears with her lead single from the upcoming record Prism is definitely a waste upon the ears. Katy has definitely lost her talent in her voice, as she tries to make her own version of the Sara Bareilles song Brave. She sounds more like a whimper of herself than someone who can ignite, like she did to her fans with California Gurls. I think Katy should go back to square one with her voice, than ignite something new.  Song: D-
0	I'm the uncle that buys. and then, has to listen to all of these songs over and over. Who ever picked this song, in her own words, "every body makes mistakes. nobody's perfect."
0	Not the original PBS recording. I traded phones, and lost the ringtone I used for Mom.  Now, I don't have Mom, the phone, or the ringtone I paid Sprint for. GRRRRRR!
0	Album is great, but the record itself arrived extremely warped and felt very cheap.
0	It has a hook for sure but this is not the Zac Brown Band I fell in love with. The entire album is terrible and it pains me to say that :(
0	Love this song but buyer beware - this is not the recording that was originally released.
0	This is NOT a piece of music.  It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.  Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
0	This album is nothing short of a pop laden, sadness parade.  I remember the days when Jewel was an artist deserving of respect.  Now she looks more like a thirty year old Spears wanna-be.  What a sad desension for such a talent.  Lets hope some day Jewel will rediscover the joys of Folk and return again to her former glory.  In the mean time at least we still have the Greats (Townes VanZandt, Gillian Welch, Linda Thompson, The Jayhawks, John Gorka, Joni Mitchel, Tom Paxton, Phil Oches, Nick Drake ect.) Long live Folk.
0	This CD harkens back to Bavarian "volksmusik."  Think of "Mack the Knife" or "Komm Mein Schatz" sped up to a techno beat, with an annoying singer who can do nothing but brag about how  all the girls love him. This is currently is hit in Europe, and I  really can understand why.  It's perfect "Eurotrash," and it's  really fun; if you don't listen to it too much.  That said, it's pretty  banal.  Anton should stay in Tirol.
0	Classics are called that for a reason and this album tries to redo them and sell to whomever.  I want the tracks I heard growing up not these with a different vocalist.  I don't know the history of Foreigner but the difference in sound makes these hard to listen to.
0	I thought this was for the full song. Very disappointed
0	Quite disappointed.  Not up to Maroon 5's usually greatness. Pretty boring songs
0	I hear this music in church, and am not particularly "sold" on this type of music for church. Please not here on my Kindle too.
0	Would never by again I deleated it, it not worth it at all save your money, it the worst ever
0	I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?  To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.  After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.  On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.  A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!):  I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.  If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as "You're just jealous!" or "I'd like to see you do better!" or "How is it in your parents' basement?" or "You must jerk off to your computer!" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:  "Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!"  FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!  If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.  To those of you who would call me "pretentious" or "music snob" or "self-righteous" or "self-absorbed," you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is "simple," (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:  "Devil's Night Out" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones "Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols" by The Sex Pistols "The Essential Heart" by Heart "Highway To Hell" by AC/DC "Meat Is Murder" by The Smiths "The Strange Case Of." by Halestorm "Greatest Hits" by Tom Petty "Complete Greatest Hits" by The Cars "Ugly" by Life of Agony "Remain In Light" by Talking Heads  As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!  I also wish to point out that arguments such as "Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!" or "You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)
0	I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.
0	Stone Sour really surprised me when they did their own version for this song.it just doesn't feel like stone sour,because they are a hard rock band and this is a pop song. Its a decent cover,but wicked game doesn't need to be redone by stone sour. Stone sour isn't good with acoustic songs in my opinion.they should stick to their guns and make good hard rock. I wouldn't waste my money on this single.it really has nothing to offer to fans of stone sour.
0	This is not the version I wanted. This has some rap insertions that I really not like, but it was missing from the sample. How do I get the normal version?
0	Already had the song but had to buy it here for a flipagram
0	It doesn't sound anything like what I heard on the radio.  Maybe the Hearts of Space playlist was out of order, but I'm very unhappy with this disc.
0	This has to be the worst holiday song ever made.  I can't believe anyone would actually pay for this.  I would not even download it for free.
0	Most of the songs get really annoying after about three times. If you can get it for $5.00 or under, buy it . if not save your money!
0	This recording is NOT the recording from which Kix enjoyed uber play time during the hair days. I'd go so far to sayNot the version is just OK. I'm on the hunt for the "real" version of this tune. Disappointing and distracting to my ear, so I'm off to find the other. You've been warned. :-/  \m/
0	I won't say I hate this album because, taken for what it is - a tribute to the songs of Foreigner, its not bad. But labeling FOREIGNER across the top in giant all caps, is at BEST an outright lie.  This is NOT foreigner. Anyone who compares even a single track can hear it instantly. I did. I compared the 'real' track of "Waiting for a girl like you" with the version on this album right here in Amazon, not on CDs, or whatnot. They come up right under one another when you search for Foreigner songs so I could hear them literally back to back. Its night and day and the songs on this album don't come out in a good light at all.  The greatest failing of this album is the utter lack of honesty it displays in trying to label its self a true Foreigner album. Its not. Its anything but. So if you want a REAL collection of Foreigner hits LOOK ELSEWHERE! Even at 5 bucks, its more than this collection of covers is worth.
0	This was just not his usual fare. It's too hard for my tastes. I'd recommend his albums but I couldn't get into this song as I'd hoped.
0	the download cut on me and now i only have half of the song just lik`e the last one. I demand a new download and on the proyile.
0	I've listened to this album several times trying to find something to like. I give up! This album is a stinker! Here are the reasons I hate this album.  1.) It's not up to the level of her previous work. (Car Wheels on A Gravel Road, Sweet Old World, etc.) This isn't in the same league!  2.) It sounds like poetry which was written and then forced to be songs. The lyrics don't work as songs! The music sounds like it was an afterthought.  3.) The lyrics are lame! The song "What If" is an embarrassment! It's elementary school level writing. Example lyrics: "what if cats walked on water and birds had bank accounts"  or "if the president wore pink!" What was she smoking? "I love you mama you're sweet. I love you mama you're sweet, I love you mama you're sweet." MY GOD! We get it already! It's so monotonous! The song "Wrap My Head Around That" is nine minutes of pure hell! Sample lyrics: "What I thought you thought I thought was actually in  your head." That song could be used to torture terrorists at Abu Ghraib!  4.) There are no hooks. Nothing memorable.  5.) It's depressing. Each cd should come with a sample of Paxil!  I'm shocked at some people who say "if it were any other artist I'd give this 3 stars, but since it's Lucinda I'll give it 5." This album doesn't even deserve 3 stars if you're being honest. I know Time magazine called her America's best songwriter, but I think they may change their opinion after hearing this album! This is the most disappointing cd I've ever bought!
0	I absolutely love EmmyLou but it sounds like this CD was recorded under water and it sounds like she's not opening her mouth when she sings. Six White Cadillacs is really nice but as much as I like it most of the time I don't have a clue of what she is singing. This is really bad.
0	This is one CRAP soundtrack. I would rather have a pencil rammed into my ear than hear any of this again. Sendak must be roiling and seething in hell over this atrocity.  IT IS STILL CRAP. (And who told this febrile effete fatuous biddy she can sing?) ps- lil girlz relax i did not say she was fat
0	First of all, the composition itself (Petite Messe Solennelle) may not be for everyone.  There are some fine moments, but I find many of the choral movements to be sprawling and unfocused.  The martial-sounding tenor aria is a little goofy and operatic for it's sacred text, but if you really like Rossini, you might get some guilty pleasure out of it.  The soloists are uneven (I find the bass and mezzo to be especially disappointing).  In general, there are some terrifying intonation moments, especially during the treacherous (a cappella) Sanctus.  Wish I could recommend a better recording, but this is my first acquaintence with the piece.  All things considered, I plan on dumping my copy.  I haven't even listened to the Stabat Mater, which of course is much more widely recorded work.
0	What a piece of trash! All the good musicians out there that barely get a chance to record and then this egotistical clown trots into the studio. Don't waste your money. probably the worst album in the history of music.
0	I just bought this from another site which DID not have reviews: if I had just researched on amazon I would have seen that this  is NOT THE ORIGINAL Soundtrack. It is a sterile re recording of the melodies with very bad female vocals. DO NOT BUY
0	Let me preface this review by saying I love the song Lowdown By Boz Scaggs. However three minutes and 28 seconds into the song there is a beep. It is distracting and ruined the song for me. I am (for the first time) very unhappy with my digital purchase!
0	I love the song, but the recording level on this is insanely low.  It's the definition of irony, trying to "turn up the radio" so that you can even hear it in the first place, for a song titled "turn up the radio."
0	A friend on facbook suggested this "singer". wish he hadn't.  Totally weak voice, pure pop crap songs that are overdone and sound like Dannii Minogue throw-away songs. and throw away is what I would do if anyone gave me a cd by this "singer"  Learn to sing and not over-produce the material.  And get some better material while you're at it.
0	I have enjoyed listening to Mario for years with his rich, stirring voice but the only word for this CD is "S-A-P-P-Y." The songs were indistinguishable from one another, each sickenly sweet and trite. I need a Mario-realignment and listen to "Sometimes I Dream.
0	I saw these guys live in 2010 and quickly realized that these guys had a lot of talent.  Their first CD was stellar - not one bad song on it.  I let others listen to it and everyone loved it.  Enter their second CD.  it's awful.  It's nothing like the first CD: not the guitars, not the vocals, not the vibe.  It's as if the band went back in time to 1963 and recorded it as if reverb was the newest thing and should be used as much as possible.  Every song has this.  It reminded me of that "Dawning of the Age of Aquarius" crap.  I wasn't even sure if the singer was the same until the very last song where you can finally hear some of Brewer's trademark vocals.  I wanted to cry because I waited 2 years for this CD and it was such a disappointment.  I mean, this is like finding out Santa Claus isn't real kind of disappointment.
0	could not even finish listening to this did not recognize a lot of the artists di dnot care for the music deleted it from kindle
0	disappointing - not as good as the usual radio version
0	I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves. They'd do anything for "Kurdt" and are easily-lead. Just look at the how they say "listening to it makes me like it". If you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day, would you enjoy THAT? Same concept with these songs. People like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment. Just because you've heard something before isn't necessarily grounds for you to like it.
0	Whoever put together the streaming managed to leave out several movements of several symphonies. i.e. the title of the set is misleading.
0	What song?, very short prelude is all. Deleting  99 cents wasted!
0	I was highly pissed that "Beg For It" was not on this album. it's on the "Reclassified" album
0	A long time fan of Daft Punk, I had been waiting years for a new release from this group, and after all that wait, THIS is what they release?  A boring, wanna-be disco track that is utterly repetitive and  completely anti-climactic?  After Justin Timberlake's album, this track (and the entire album) is easily the second biggest disappointment of the 2013.  The weakest material Daft Punk ever recorded and a complete musical misfire.
0	I love the writing of both of these artists ,together and seperately; i just think the production is really crappy, especially for the credits, sorry no tall, deep, or wide, and no one seems to have fugured out where their vocals belong, cant listen to it anymore, sounds flat, kick drum, bass ,no seperation, no dimension, i guess different strokes,! Compare, to Steve Earle, and Lucinda Williams on "Feelin Alright" then tell me im wrong!
0	this cd has a scratch on track ,1 and 2 and 3, i played it once, i want to return it, i did not do it, i want to swap it for another cd classic country great story songsII
0	Terrible ~ Not funny. typically, ugly pear-shaped guys are funny
0	Listen - I believe Terrance is a talented actor but com'on now. a singer?  Yes - Hustle and Flow was entertaining. I even thought some of his lyrical execution was pretty good!  When it comes to singing though?  Terrance sounds like a washed up wannabe Seal.  He tries to weave some deep tales in his songs but most of the time it just does not make sense.  I want to be there with him but most of the time I just get lost in a bunch of mumbo jumbo.  The background music is absolutely fantastic.  His voice is absolutely terrible.  He is trying to push the limits and he figures by producing his own album he can do just that.  I think I saw in the video here on Amazon that he was seeking feedback and many people he was talking to said he was breaking all the rules and doing it with great success.  As much as I'd like to agree he pretty much is breaking my ear drums with his irritating voice.  Sure being different is okay - I think it's great.  There are plenty of artists that I really love and enjoy who are different from D'Angelo to Maxwell to Andre 3 stacks.  All of these artists are talented. I mean very talented in a artistic kind of gifted nature.  The album is missing any type of geniuine soulfulness - I guess that's what I was looking for. some type of soulful depth.  No interesting lyrics can take the place of a soulful command of your content.  Terrance is just not soulful.  He comes off as cocky with a false sense of reaching for something greater than what he is able to give.  I commend him for doing something different but I do not find his execution graceful.  All the fantastic background music cannot mask it either.  Sorry - this album just doesn't cut it.
0	I guess it was not what I thought it would be from the description.  I was disappointed and the music was not relaxing to me.
0	Could not add it to a class slideshow presentation. Only streamed.  Boo
0	This is another case where less is more.  I found the sound of rain to be very heavy and unrelenting.  Instead of a sound of a refreshing spring shower I felt I was caught in a deluge.
0	This song is not as great as I expected. If Wynonna is indeed singing I couldn't tell you where her part was. I should have downloaded the Kenny Rogers version.
0	As I already commented in one of the reviewer's posts, this is very amateurish sounding. It's kind of like when we would record things on a cassette player years ago. The audience noises are so loud, it is difficult to dismiss. VERY DISTRACTING! Wish I had read the reviews before buying! The songs are gorgeous, just hard to hear for all the noise!
0	They're trying too hard to sound different and that diminishes what they had already built. Too much synth, too much drums. However, I like all of the lyrics and Marcus' voice is still soothing, I just want an acoustic version of this album.
0	I would not write this artist off completely- but this is not exactly what I had in mind.   Not a lot of thunder in this cd.  Anyone considering this for de-sensitization on dogs afraid of thunderstorms pass on this one.  It is a relaxation cd but some people preferred more thunder - and  while this is *not* promoted for helping dogs over come thunder, I don't think it had enough thunder to be effective if someone has chosen the product for this purpose.
0	It is a misprint. Same as the last one.
0	Did not like: just drunk men singing coal songs.
0	This course is just awful and like the other reviewers, I have had to look everything up elsewhere to begin to understand.  Last time I'm taking an online course like this.
0	If you ever go to a country music bar, you'll probably hear this song, a real classic!  Love this song!
0	Not as good as I thought it would be. To soft voice music to loud disappointed. Would not order it agaim
0	I remember this from back in the day, so I bought it here.  It is a good tune, but after a few plays gets old .
0	This product may be great but it was not what I wanted. I don't like re-mixes. Next time I will read it better.
0	I've had difficulty sleeping since my husband passed away and had typically used just a soothing, quiet music type cd to fall asleep to. After reading the description, and in Time Magazine no less, I felt confident that this was going to be a better option than just plain old soothing music. Boy was I wrong. The voice and words Prince uses are lame and the second cd that I choose to purchase with the first, was even more disappointing. It was suppose to be for Health and Fitness. What a "crock" it is identical, I mean identical to the first, only Prince may say a word or two about how you should eat healthy and exercise. Give me a break,I feel like I was totally deceived and ripped off. I will surely not recommend this to my friends! I will continue to listen to my 7 dollar soothing music cd and toss Prince's.
0	I love Barb, but this duet is not a good as the first one. Her partners did very little to enhance any of the songs, in my opinion.
0	I really get tired of hearing this pop-dance piece all day on the radio.  It's nothing special.  PS:  Jagger has no moves.
0	On the bright side of things, at least you can listen to samples of this cd prior to purchasing. I highly recommend they listen to "A Brief Tutorial On Dubstep Production (Original)" by Dubba Johhnny before even attempting another "dubstep" cd.
0	It wasn't the radio version I thought it was.  I wish I could return to download and get a refund.
0	I have been a HUGE, I mean HUGE Josh Groban fan since day one with "To Where You Are" on his first album.  I've even seen him in concert a few times.  But this is JUNK!  His voice is lovely as always, but his song choices are terrible this go round.  I love the non-english ones.  They tend to be my favorite.  Dig deeper and be more patient to find better songs next time guys!  Still love ya!  Erin Denver
0	If you like Christian Science reading materials, you will like this. I believe in faith and positive thinking, and even miracles from the power of God's divine healing, but his mind over matter teaching doesn't cure everything and can do more harm to those in desperate need of medical intervention. His teaching has a critical tone for those suffering with illness, chronic pain, disability, or disease, like somehow it is all your fault for your lack of faith, negative speaking or thinking. If your leg is broken, or if you child has spinal meningitus, don't stand in front of the mirror making positive affirmations. get to an emergency room ASAP. You can still exercise your faith in Gods healing power or positive thinking while doing all these things. Going to the doctor or taking medicine does not mean you have no faith. Believe God for a positive outcome and let everything work together toward your recovery. Don't blame yourself because your happy thoughts didn't make your cancer disappear.
0	Alas this was not the original recording. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be.
0	This is not music this is junk. this guy will talk you to death.
0	I bought this for my friend but after opening it I found there is a big crack on the plastic cover. It made me so embarrassing.
0	I guess when they call it "noise" you can't really complaint that it sounds like noise. It is not really a relaxing sound, which is my goal with sleep aids.
0	Why re-recorded?  Is this the original "A Flock of Seagulls"?  It's very close to the original but I can tell it's not.  There simply is no reason to re-record this.
0	Well, I must first of all say that I am not a Mayer fan. I bought this download for a friends birthday card. which by the way I haven't sent yet! Anyway, I listen to allot of music, and I like alot of differnt kinds of music. but this cd was just boring. I have other Mayer music, and honestly. older is better as far as I can see for John Mayer. it lost something somewhere . can't  say that I liked it much at all. not that the playing or singing wasn't good, it just didn't have any 'life' to it. felt like he recorded the whole CD while he was laying down. Just MHO folks. that's all! Guess I'd best sent that CD on to the friend I bought it for, she's probably waiting for it, and most likely will love it!
0	Cd is nice, except most of the songs have clapping at the start or end.  Would be amazing if the clapping wasn't there!
0	I gave it time.  I gave it chances.  Because they're ARCADE FIRE. they who came out of nowhere with Funeral, debuting with an already fully-formed aesthetic, and the sheer confidence of a stadium-packing triumphant band.  And then Neon Bible with an even HUGER sound (an impossible thought on the heels of something like Wake Up from Funeral).  And now this.  Watered down, tepid, and approaching dull in the shadow of those albums that came before it.  In a way, I envy those who came to Arcade Fire with this album and found it eye-opening, for what they'll get to experience going back through the previous releases.  At the same time, I fear that this will define their sound for new listeners who simply won't bother with their earlier masterpieces.  So to those who haven't heard Wake Up, Intervention, (Antichrist Television Blues), and what used to be the enormously impressive - awesome in the literal sense of the word - sound of what preceded this near-throwaway set, DO IT NOW.  You will think very differently about The Suburbs after.  I should note, however, that there was another reviewer who suggested that the shoddy engineering and production may be the culprit with its unimpressive sound.  Their live shows apparently haven't lost the energy, so maybe it will be remastered and improved upon in the future.
0	very bad album, i didn't not like it at all
0	This says "clean" but most definitely has explicit lyrics.  I downloaded it because my 5-year-old daughter likes dancing to the radio version, but now I can't even play it for her. fail!
0	This is the first and only Rihanna song I have ever purchased.  I'm pretty sure it will be my last.
0	This is literally awful. A friend gave it to me as some kind of joke. His joke wasn't funny and neither was David Tanny.  Also, most of his stuff can be found for free on YouTube, so there really is no reason to buy it.
0	I was very, very excited to get this CD when it first came out, about a year ago.  It was very well hyped, and for weeks in the Delaware Valley, you couldn't go anywhere without hearing "Hands Clean."  I was happy, and I was ignorant.  After listening to this CD just a few times, though, I shoved it back into its case and more or less forgot about it. Last night, I pulled it out, wondering why it wasn't in heavier rotation with my other Alanis CDs.  Well, it only took one more listening to remember why: Problem #1:  Alanis's voice here is more nasal and shrill here than on any of her other releases.  On "Jagged Little Pill," she spent half her time screaming, so her voice didn't really matter. and on "Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie" she was just a few inflections away from the spoken-word.  Here, on "Under Rug Swept," we find out the terrible truth- Alanis isn't a very good singer.  She has a great grunge-voice, and a nice growly whisper, but she isn't particularly suited to the pop-style singing heard here. Problem #2:  There's no growth here.  None.  She's whining about the same things here that she was whining about eight years ago.  The difference is that she was edgy and innovative then.  She *snarled* on "Jagged Little Pill," with unforgettable lines like "And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it."  Here, she writes a cutesy narcissistic song (from her "You Oughtta Know" lover's point of view) with a sweet, if grating melody, and off-kilter mainstream singing.  She wailed to ethnic beats with mournful songs like "I Was Hoping" and quirky tunes like "So Pure."  On this, we have the bizarre and irrelevant "A Man" and the utterly obnoxious patronizing "21 Things I Want In A Lover." Problem #3:  As mentioned by one of the reviewers above, Morisette's syntax has gotten so strange as to be nearly incomprehensible.  She adds and drops syllables to force the lyrics to match the tunes, and the end result is a mess. (I am a Tori Amos fan.  I know what I am talking about.) From "Precious Illusions": "This ring will me yet as will you knight in shining armor/ This pill will help me yet as will these boys gone through like water" Say what? Overall, it just seems like Alanis, for all her spiritual posturing, has just found herself a cozy little niche in teen angst, and will ride this pony for all it's worth.  I, for one, will hold out for something new and different.
0	The ocean sound never changes, just a constant roar, never breaks the shore, got on my nerves after a while.
0	This CD was extraordinarily difficult for me to find, and was a disappointment when I found it. The late great Mark Heard was playing around in his basement studio while drinking too much coffee or something. This is a blemish on an otherwise wonderful string of CDs.
0	It's okay, not one of my favorite songs of all time. But still pretty cool. Worth the few cents wasted on it.
0	Bought Tame Impala for a buddy. He received Mumford and Sons. How embarrassing. Now I have to figure out how to return it for him from 1000 miles away.
0	Granted the original wasn't a musical masterpiece, but this cover is just terrible, want to pierce my own ear drums kind of terrible.
0	There is no reason for this. It's actually insulting when you factor in his other hits collections. He has 3 volumes, so why is it compressed to one disc? You know how many hits are missing. A lot. The remastering is nice though, but still, this is not necessary. He deserves a 3 disc best of. Nothing less
0	I liked everything over all but dude I didn't get my poster nor the "extra" photo card I was so mad, and I honestly don't wanna go through all the trouble of returning it back and blah blah blah. I'm so disappointed.
0	I think maybe there is 1 song on this CD that I would listen to over but was dissappointed by it as a whole.
0	I wanted the Santa Maria Tango and did not have it and seller seems to do nothing about this althoigh I just went through the cd to see if it was on it.
0	Wow, this is so weird.  It talks and has this bizzare music that is supposed to be motivating.  But all it really motivates me to do is tip my head like my labrador and say, "huh"?
0	Not enough music, too many testimonials.
0	I have been a Bob Dylan fan since about 1964. I own every album he ever made. I cherish nearly all of them, and there are many from each decade of his career that I think are great and STILL listen to with some regularity. I consider him to be one of the greatest songwriters and rock artists of the 20th century. I believe he long ago should have won a Pulitzer and/or Nobel Prize.  And, I should add, I generally enjoy Christmas music - the old chestnuts, the rock-pop Christmas tunes, and so on.  That being said, this album is atrocious. It should never have been conceived. Having been conceived, it should have never been recorded. Having been recorded, it should never have been issued. Having been issued, it should never have been bought.  Many of the twists and turns in Dylan's career have been misunderstood or misconstrued by his fans and the general public. In this case, the misunderstanding and misconstruing is on Dylan's part - and attempts by critics and listeners to "get it" are misguided.
0	When this 2CD Alternative Versions album was released through his fanclub, I decided to read fan reviews first to find out what Jagged Edge was all about. Personally, I did not like 'Jagged' (2006) so why pay attention to remixed versions? Numan stated that when he started working on Jagged, several producers created a different sound, each worthy of an individual release, so he gave us 'Jagged Edge' and we could all hear different versions by Sulpher, Ade Fenton and others. It is now March 2010 and I was offered a copy of Jagged Edge. Curiosity got the better of me so I accepted the CD and decided to give it a try. I can honestly say that if you are one of those die-hard Numan fans, who believe his music is perfect all the time, or anything he releases should be in your collection, you will buy this album. If you are more open minded, objective and subjective to arts and listen to many different bands, you will agree that this is without doubt the WORST NUMAN RELEASE EVER! These alternative versions of an already poor album, is only of interest to those 'Numanoids', but if you are not (or no longer a die-hard) you have nothing positive to say about this collection of over-long, badly written songs. On the 'Jagged' (2006) album I could find maybe 3 songs that I would describe as good - but 3 good songs was not enough for me to like that album -  but this album is just so bad, so unnecessary, if leaves you speechless. Jagged Edge ruined what ever appreciation I had for (3 songs on) Jagged. The front cover of Jagged Edge should already be a good indication of what to expect, because it shows no attempt at designing anything - just Numan sticking his nose up. I tried to listen to Jagged Edge twice, but this is the first time in my entire life that I could not finish an album and took a nail to the CDs, so that when someone finds it in my garbage can, they will be spared major disappointment in an otherwise outstanding musician, who recorded some of the most memorable music in history. Like I said before - for die-hard fans only, which is probably why he released it in the first place, because as an album to gain new fans, it fails miserably. Avoid
0	Grace goes Pop and Dance.  Yes, it's still her signature voice; sounds like her, but she's veered off in the Pop and Dance music direction.  Maybe it's an attempt to gain a wider audience.  Many lead singers have done it before (Gwen Stephanie?).  This album has the pretty typical Pop and Dance sound, arrangements, and the lyrical depth you'd expect.  That is, not much.  To each his own.  I'll pass.
0	Doesn't sound good for some reason.  No deep sounds.  Sounds tinny
0	I bought this mp3 thinking the sound quality would be good.  Boy was I wrong - you can barely hear  the tune unless you crank up the volume.
0	this album really suck! i mean she doesn't have the country voice in any of her songs, nothing but pop. her voice sounds really weak and all the high notes she is trying to sing sound like she is straining her vocals just to be impressive. why couldn't she find something that she is talented of.
0	Can I give this Group 0 stars?  I paid a $1.98 for this CD and I feel ripped off.  I'm absolutely serious folks, this is one of the worst bands I've ever heard.  I got the CD, was a bit excited to hear a Celtic rock band who used bagpipes, so I put it in my car stereo.  It wasn't too bad other than every song starts exactly the same.  I mean the musicians can play their instruments.  IT"S HORRIBLE!  I actually left this CD on the counter of the pizza place I went for lunch.  I left it there because I never wanted to hear anything like it again.  If you truely like Celtic Rock, Traditional Irish Folk/Punk; The Pogues, Dropkick Murphy's, Flogging Molly, even The Real McKenzies, do yourself a favor - Stay clear of this unbelievable crap.  I don't know how they ever got this recorded.  There must be some absolutely crazy recording artists out there.  I'm out.  I'm getting nautious just talking about them.
0	Can't get it on my Echo and am very unhappy!
0	I have been a fan of Josh Groban from the very beginning.  His exquisite voice has helped me through some very difficult times and has driven me to tears by it's sheer beauty.  This cd also made me cry, but for an entirely different reason.  It is bad.  Really bad.  The songs, the arrangements and yes even his vocals don't come close to meeting the standard that Josh has established in his career.  It pains me deeply to say that.  I don't profess to know what is inside Josh's head, but I have a strong feeling that he was trying to go more "mainstream" with this album.  He once said that he realizes that sometimes he will lose fans on one end and pick new ones up on the other.  I think he is sadly mistaken.  I would be very shocked if he garners any new fans based on this mediocre cd.  And what is sadder yet is the fact that these are the songs we will be hearing him perform over the next couple of years, on tour, on tv appearances and yes perhaps even on the radio.  Josh has said that he is proud of his fans and the fact that they are "along for the ride".  Sorry, but that ride has come to a screeching halt and a number of us may be leaping off.  Wait, I think I may cry again.
0	Do not download this album. The sound is terrible. The CD sounds horrible as well. Wait for the the re-masters
0	It is a download that I can't retrieve; so I can't listen to it.
0	This is the worst Dream Theater album I've ever heard. Been a huge fan for years but this is slow, uninspired and boring. If I have to hear James Labrie sing over a piano again, I'm going to jump head first into a woodchipper.
0	If you're looking for the version of Stand or Fall that you listened to on the radio way back when, from the album Shuttered Room, this is not it. It's a live recording. The Amazon sample doesn't make that clear.
0	A lot of her music is catchy and fun, but NO to this song.
0	This is NOT a piece of music.  It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.  Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
0	When I first read all of the glowing reviews here, I thought that I would instantly fall in love with this album. A hardcore guitarist, a DJ, and an acoustic musician. what's not to love? Unfortunately, the album is a drivelling mess. Maybe if they never wrote any lyrics, it may have turned out a bit more solid and interesting. Instead, you get an album that, while 'precise' and well-produced, lacks any edge you might expect from such a combo. Not every song is an utter disataster but most are, and the lyrics just about ruin the album. Be careful of the hype (or contact me to get a used copy that was only played three times. ;)
0	Not so hot. Listened twice and erased it. Formula writing at its worst. There are many better tunes with much better attention to lyrics and riffs.
0	This is a good example of the type of knock-offs that rode the tide of Beatlemania. Unfortunately it's not nearly as good an album as it is an historical artifact. The Buggs were an Omaha band who recorded this album in Minneapolis, the album's proclamation of having been waxed in England notwithstanding. The ten tracks include two Lennon-McCartney covers ("I Want to Hold Your Hand" and "She Loves You"), a cover of "Just One Look" retitled "Soho Mash," and seven originals whose attempts to ape British Invasion beat pop are at best tepid. On "East Mash" the Buggs sing more like the Four Freshmen than the four mop-tops. The musicians are competent but mostly uninspired as they try and wrap their heads around mid-60s British pop. The group's vocal harmonies sound more like the Everly Brothers, early Beau Brummels and Peter & Gordon than the Beatles, and their best song, "London Town Swing," sounds more like the Brill Building than the river Mersey. This is a nice curiosity, but not the best Beatles-inspired pop of its era (check out The Shakers, for example). The Master Classics label seems to have re-mastered this CD from vinyl as there are a few stray pops and clicks. [2009 hyperbolium dot com]
0	Sorry stevie fans. I cannot agree with your breathless bowing at the feet of stevie. I was hoping it would be good. . but it's weak. enough of the tortured breakup songs, some of the lyrics are really awkward. hardly any memorable melodies. the title track is good. the rest should have been left in the vault.
0	I wasn't aware that this was the UNTOUCHED original recording. The quality sucked and so did the song. I can't believe I just wrote those words about LYNYRD SKYNYRD but I was dissapointed.
0	Not one review is for the Erato/Conlon version if La Boheme.
0	It may not be what he's saying, but it sounds like he's saying sex at one point in the song.
0	Horrible!  Listen to Randy Graff, then listen to this version. "Raw" is not beautiful. It is a lovely passionate score, but not in this movie.  Please enjoy the real music elsewhere.
0	I love Barbara Streisand but the renditions are soooooo off and different that I didn't really enjoy it like I thought.
0	This album is a morass of songs that are airlessly produced and virtually indistinguishable from each other.  The production is so pristine that it removes the spontaneity, joy and acoustic touches of her previous releases.  That hermetically-sealed quality does no favors to songs that plod by characterlessly.  I say all of this as a huge fan of "Speak Now", which offered personality and singalong hooks even when the songs weren't great.  This album is totally resistible. It seems to go on forever, and with the sole exceptions of "Sad, Tragic, Beautiful" and "Begin Again," no songs seem to warrant the lavish production or running time expended on them.
0	For the most part, amazon includes the samples to listen to the product. Why are there no samples for the Afterglow cd's? So disappointing. Is there any chance at all to find the samples later on to listen to them, please?
0	After amazing albuns "OPERATION MINDCRIME" and "EMPIRE", this was a disapointment for me. Boring at the extreme, overproduced, it clearly show that the band was already losing their creativity vein.
0	The sound quality is good.  BUT probably the best piano solo, winged by Jess Stacy, was not included!  Benny said that Jess' solo was what made the Carnegie hall performance work.  That it was deleted on the remastering is a crime!
0	Sorry, what I would really like is a new release from Mr. Bungle!
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your privates chopped off. thats all i have to say, no 50 cent, it isn't my birthday, and we're not gonna party like its my birthday, especially not to your crappy music. have a nice day
0	A disappointment she a much better singer.
0	I selected  this rating because I wanted to be fair. The music is off don't sound like the original beat. These are good song but the beat to these songs are off. No; I would not recommend this to my friend.
0	Sounded like it was playing thru a broken speaker. 99%  of the music I buy from  Amazon is great,  but not this one
0	I have to disagree with the other two reviews. I have waited a few years for this latest effort from Eric, we were teased a couple of years ago by Eric into believing we were going to be given a live cd/dvd, (which is LONG overdue), listening to this release is dissapointing, only a couple of good tracks, hence two stars. Please do not buy this before any of his other CD's, and if you do decide to buy it, then sorry, I did warn you. I bought it blind and thought Eric would have put some of his magic on it, sadly, it is poor and had I bought this before seeing him, then I would not have attended any of his very rare gigs over here in the UK. A live cd would have kept the ball rolling, this release has slowed it down.
0	Steve Harris is and always will be the God of Bass; I'm a huge Iron Maiden fan. However, I truly hate this album on multiple levels. The lead singer is just awful. I mean no offense to him, but he can't sing (in my opinion) and I also hate his singing voice (really really hate it). I was constantly in shock at how much I truly disliked his voice and vocal style. Putting that aside, the album is more of a rock album than anything metal or hard rock. Polar opposite of Maiden, which is fine; I just hate it. The songs don't go anywhere or do anything for me, even ignoring my hatred of the singer's voice. To be totally honest here, I actually ejected it from my tray around song 7. I normally never do that and I never would write reviews on half listened to albums, except for this one. I mean nothing against Harris or the band, but for God's sake stay far away from this effort.  Way cool album cover and title though.
0	At least Bon can rest in peace knowing that if Brian cant sing, that Wing can just jump in and take over.
0	A song about clueless people for those who are not old enough to remember Moon Unit. The difference is that Valley Girl was entertaining. This is plain annoying.
0	This is worth the price of purchase for the Nutcracker and Messiah tracks alone, but the rest is really junk. A lot of it isn't even Christmas music.
0	Prior to purchasing this song, I listened to the link and really liked it, but upon purchasing it and trying to play it on my Kindle Fire and it would not load at all and now it stops up the rest of my cloud player.  I tried to return it so I could purchase another version and it won't allow me.  Very disappointed.
0	PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE! The recording has background noise (baby crying and people talking).
0	Re-recorded songs are lame. I can't get the image of a skeleton, propped up by computer-aided vocals, singing this version. Don't waste your pennies. The original has all the emotion.
0	OK, who kidnaped Crossfade and replaced them with this band? This is clearly not the group that gave us "Cold" and "Disco". Like many of the other reviews posted, I loved their debut album and was anxious for new material. Well. I guess you could say I'm STILL anxious for new material from Crossfade. Because clearly that's not who showed up in the studio to record this poor collection of material.  After just a couple weeks of listening to it, trying my darndest to like it, I've pulled it from my iPod "new music" playlist. What a waste of money.
0	The quality of the product is great and the delivery service is outstanding.  However, Susan Boyle needs to improve her style with songs, she has a beautiful voice and is best enjoyed watching her, she looses quality when you only listen to her.
0	Can't put in my Galaxy S6 library. Can only hear on cloud. Amazon can't help!
0	So disappointed would have loved this but would not work on American system so had to send back
0	This CD does not include the instrumental version of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" that was featured in the movie trailers.  The Regina Spektor version is nice, too, but I prefer the other version.  The rest of the soundtrack is just ok, with some songs that stand out better than others.
0	I would have given it a 2, but since you have to pay $6 something to return it I gave it a 1.  The songs are fine, but in the same voice so it sort of sound like you're listening to the same song throughout.  I accidently purchased 2 & that's why I wanted to return 1.
0	This is a beautiful song, but a very poor recording. Sounds like it came from a worn out cassette tape.
0	This did not download onto my cloud player app on my computer nor did it download in my music folder nor did it download in my mp3player?  I would like a refund please.
0	Love Jimmy and the song but like google it didn't download into my music files.  I have never found it.  Waste of money!
0	Not at all this is the second one that skips on every song. I will be returning it very soon and will not be getting another. I am very disappointed.
0	Just flash some chick on a trailer with some robots and explosions and any song will be number 1. What happened to the nerdy anime rejects I knew and loved?
0	Sorry, even Glambert cannot pull this song for me. Worse AI song ever. I downloaded every single AI tracks sung by AL from iTunes, but not this song. Also, shoot whoever designed this single cover.  AL looks horrible and . F A T in this photo. Yeah, you need to loose some weight, dude. :)
0	I really wanted to like the first release in 10 years from one of my favorite bands. Everything seemed to be there. except for good lyrics and any sense of melody. I listened to the CD three times yesterday and I STILL do not remember a single chorus or verse. So sad.  The new singer does a decent job but I miss Jon Anderson. Many people have compared this recording to Drama. Not as good. not even close.
0	This CD drags along from song to song, sometimes sounding like it's going to die.  The singing is so far off key, at times, that it sends chills up my spine- not in a way I like.  The musicianship is amateurish; I'd be embarrassed to stand in front of a paying audience and do what they do here.  Stoners may like it, and that's ok, but it isn't for me.
0	Just another example how Hip-Hop has lost touch. I cannot believe all the five stars for this song. RHQ mumble's half his lyrics and couldn't carry a tune even with the help of autotune. Cliche and sounds the same as hundreds of other songs on the radio.  Boring with a decent beat.
0	Stay away. These are some of Berlin's best songs, but re-recorded by original lead singer Teri Nunn and a band of youngsters that had nothing to do with the original releases.  Teri's in pretty good voice and the the sound alikes that the band puts together aren't incompetent. But the whole this is pointless. Nothing here is as good as the original release, and the original best of is still available relatively cheaply.  Get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Best-Of-Berlin-1979-1988/dp/B003EST3D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Best Of Berlin 1979-1988</a>, which features the originals.
0	Too much profanity for my virgin ears. I wish there was a warning on the single song. But there were not warnings. Loved the beat though.
0	There was a time when you could feel reasonably assured that a remastered piece of old music would sound better than the original cd release.  Sadly, this is no longer the case.  I have lots of remastered CDs; led zeppelin, aerosmith, bob Dylan, Judas Priest, frank Sinatra, rod Stewart, The Beatles, and on and on.  They all sound great.  Lately even old timers like Springsteen here and the Rolling Stones are falling prey to the dangers of over compression during the mastering process.  I have been waiting years for Bruce to remaster his catalog, especially The River.  As soon as it arrived I played that album and immediately knew something was wrong.  It was way too loud!  I listened to the whole first disc wishing I was wrong, but I wasn't.  Then I played BITUSA, same thing.  Very loud and harsh, unpleasant.  I don't listen loud to begin with, but I had to lower the volume.  My ears were literally hurting.  This is very disappointing for me because I had been waiting so long for this.  I've already processed my return as I can't afford to jut have this sitting on my shelf unused.
0	There really isn't anything here worth buying. The song is pretty much just a boring waste of time. It isn't the worst song ever, but the music is pretty lame, the vocals uninspired, the lyrics repetitive and passe. Nothing here i would go out of my way to listen to, and would definitely never pay money for it.
0	i don't know why this is on my account. i never ordered this. this is a mistake. im sure its nice but i don't know
0	Redundant. Nothing like her playing with Tommy
0	Not even enough here to rate! It cuts out and off before you can distinguish anything on it. Don't like it.
0	A couple of good songs.  If You Could See Me Now the Hit. Rest mediocre
0	Third track has very irritating distortion  in the male soloist part vocals, and also on other vocal parts; overall recording is on the bright side. Also, had varying levels of tracking difficulty depending on which one of 3 CD players in the house I used, and upon looking closer at the cd, noticed it is a "CD-R" or a burned on demand disk - not a pressed disk. Performance is good and spirited. Recording distortion and tracking problems a let down.
0	Take a bunch of songs that were already extremely annoying, add stupid little kids singing the choruses, and what do you have? Kidz Bop. These songs were bad enough when sung by the original artists, but they are just torture to listen to after hearing them come from a bunch of annoying kids. Don't get this album for ANYONE, not even kids.
0	This is a crapy download unless you want to hear the music only. THERE IS NO SINGING! Now i have to go download the mono version because it does have singing in it. This download is like Obama & Hillary, you hear the music but they don't say anything.
0	A song I like, but with a jarring edit midway to remove a vulgar word.  I'm an adult, I want to listen to this song in my car, and the clumsy radio edit is a killjoy. There was no indication that this song was edited unless I had read the reviews, which I must do from now on.
0	I bought this for a friend.  I would not have purchased it for myself.
0	Not what I expected. I was so upset that I even purchase this. Did not keep me interested. I tried to keep an open mind.
0	I hate it when good bands go bad. I heard the 1st track on the radio a few days ago and said to myself is that Crossfade? Then sure enough it was I was like cool they have a new cd out. It's been out sence August ('06) and I didn't even know that should've clued me in but I figured it was Crossfade their last cd rocked this one should too, boy was I wrong. Washing the world away is the only song that kind of sounds like the pervious cd which I'm sure is why it was on the air. I'm majorly dissapointed the song Colors on the last cd was really awesome then they go and ruin it with some wussy crap, the air waves are already full of that. Maybe the next cd they'll go back to what made them and stop trying to be like everyone else.
0	when I downloaded this song I tried it with my regular player and it stopped playing at 1:14 its terrible.
0	Tired theme, annoying as hell, horrid ear gouging vocals and vomit inducing twillight propaganda. Complete gutter polish trash!  Avoid if you have any taste in music whatsoever!
0	Even though it is labeled as "Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul" this is not the version that was on the album nor is it even them.  This is a NJ area band doing their version of the Little Steven song - Not sure why it shows as Little Steven.  If you google the group - you find that they are from Asbury Park, which is to say they are about as much like Springsteen and Little Steven as John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown band was. Which is to say that they are both from NJ.
0	This is an absolute waste of money if you want a good tribute to the bad boys of rock then pick up Down At The Whiskey. Its much better and still different but with actual talent unlike this piece of crap. http:/ www.amazon.com/Down-At-Whiskey-Millennium-1981-2013/dp/B00ERH142K/ref=sr_1_25?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1429367854&sr=1-25&keywords=motley+crue
0	I do not mean to sound like a Jani Lane loyalist (RIP Jani), but this is not even close to a true "Warrant" album.  The music is poorly produced, the songs are sub par.  I think Trixter made better music, and if you even know who they are then you know this album blows.  I met the band and saw them the the M3 2011 festival in Maryland with the new singer.  He has a strong voice, but he does not have a pleasant voice, sorry Robert. you are a nice guy, but I will never buy anything else you make.  This album was such a waste of money that if I though I could get my money back I would.  Trust me, I gave this album a chance, I listened to it several times to give the music a chance to grow on me. it did not!  I would tell you as Warrant fan, which I swear I am. spend your money on something else.  This album is garbage.
0	maybe I just haven't listened to it enough times, but after a couple of go 'rounds, I just didn't want to hear it any more. Too bad, because I love me some Jimmy Cliff songs.
0	Whatever happened to music? These bands are killing music. The world of music is so sad today. This garbage is shovelling music as we know it in it's grave.
0	wow this is the absolute worst thing ive ever heard in my life. while i was listening i thought i was going into a seizure it was so bad. some how the sounds cause your brain to go into a craze like state its so bad. for your own safety i advise you to not buy this
0	I ordered this CD collection hoping that it would have some songs from La Fea Mas Bella.  What this consisted of was Angelica Vale singing songs when she was probably a teenager.  I love Angelica and have been watching her novela for the second time.  I do not plan on ever listening to her CD again. It was a waste of money.  I would love to buy a mature CD if she ever records one.
0	I'm a huge Demi fan, but this album is just awful. There's only three songs on the album that are any good. Most of the songs it sounds like she's straining to sing. I understand she's trying to be more emotional with these songs, but it just doesn't work. I expected a lot better.
0	I cannot like it even less.  It is not a good rendition of the beautiful song that we are used to.  Awful
0	I've made a few poor choices in selecting MP3's to make up a portable classical library.  This version seems only fair.  The fidelity is lacking in sharp or crispness, but then it is an older recording - Robert Shaw hasn't been around for years or even decades? Having been a musician most of my life I should have developed or learned about the better and poorer artists and recordings, and at least should have better researched what others had to say.  Taking note that I am the first to review this ought to tell the reader something.  I love this piece of music and was overly eager to purchase and listen - these pieces pop into my head and I tend to jump at the first offering. Take a lesson from me.  Shop around and read what the truly informed have to say.
0	I'm sad to disagree with most of the reviewers here, but I hated it. I didn't even finish listening to it.
0	I do not now how this got on my list. I have no memory of  this what so ever. Let alone if I ever heard it.
0	Great song, but the download version is only 128kbps. Why is no higher quality version available?
0	When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice. I definitely think Rihanna needs to take more time into her songs, and not rush into making album after album, year after year. It really has put a strain on her talent. Talk That Talk was awful, and Unapologetic is the same way.  Song: D-
0	Aptly named album. I've never heard an artist change his sound this much from one album to another. It's not even recognizable as the same artist. I'm still holding out that this is a joke, and that the real new M83 album is right around the corner.
0	I'm a long time Crows fan, but I wish I had listened to this one before buying it.  Would have saved me a few bucks, as I would have never bought it.  I find this album a very weak effort.  However, I saw them in concert a month or so ago, and the live show is still great.  For the CD, I suggest listening to it first.  If you like it, buy it.
0	The review above is a total lie, this is some white supremacy propaganda. I burned it, as in set it on fire. Worst review driven impulse buy ever.
0	I'm a big fan of kasabians previous work. They're first album and their last one (velociraptor ). I'm not feeling this one.
0	I really was expecting more from Jordan.  He knocked it out of the park when he covered Queen on The Voice, but this album is 8 cover songs which have all been painfully slowed way down.  The originals, or those we think are original, sound great and I would recommend just buying those songs on iTunes or individually through Amazon Music.  I do not recommend buying the album.
0	do not buy this it is a mix cd that someone made
0	This is really a misleading title.  My husband is convinced its made by some amateur who has no clue about music.  Just because you play a tune using a piano, doesn't mean it is MOZART!  It really amazes me that someone has the nerve to put this together and sell it as Mozart.  It has "Oh Donny Boy" and "Itzy bitzy spider" and such songs along with some classical music.  How is that Mozart?!?!?  Its really awful!
0	Well in short, not good at all, not my chemical romance style, if they felt like getting back to the basic's at least go back to decent music like three cheers.
0	I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS SONG FOR QUITE A WHILE. THE DOWNLOAD I GUESS WAS O.K. BUT THE SONG DID NOT COME OUT CLEAR. THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT OF SKIPPING IN THE SONG. OVERALL WHAT I HEARD WAS ALRIGHT. THANKS
0	The singing sounds OK, maybe good. However the totally annoying scratching sound which is very loud was so distracting I couldn't wait for the song to end. It added NOTHING to the song.
0	John Lennon kind of sucked at this point
0	i got a box of 100 of this cd for free from a radio station in ny due to it flop! i was flip to see them for $15 each due to i go 100 unopen cd free thay is the same cd! wooo good luck sale it, it sold so bad in the shops thay gave them away! woo no joke love to see if this sales so high if so ill post the total box one by one for 15$ each! killer mark up ! very cool
0	Although I was never a big fan of Jewel, I was suprised that Jewel, of all people, would sell herself out to commericalism. I never thought I would see the day that Jewel would turn herself into a Britney Spears knockoff just to get airplay on top 40 radio.  What's next?  Torn (Remix) by Natalie Imbruglia feat. 50 Cent? This album is worth borrowing from a friend.  Not because of the talent, but so you can understand what commericalism can do to a once talented artist.  The album is interesting only the way a car wreck is interesting.  0304 is the kind of album I'd expect from a debut artist, not someone like Jewel.  0304 is what happens when artists listen to executives in the boardroom instead of their fans.
0	Je n'avais pas opt pour ce que j'ai reu mais bien pour la photo ici prsente et le programme qui n'est pas le mme que celui que j'ai reu. On appelle a de la tromperie sur la marchandise. Par contre, cet artiste est un des plus gnials.
0	Vulgar language in song writing is just laziness and lack of talent.
0	Very disappointed in the quality of the CD.
0	Insipid versions of holiday classics that never deserved to be released.  Dylan's voice, an acquired taste even in its' finest moments, sounds as if he's been gargling with old razor blades.  Throughout my first (and only) listen to this mess-terpiece, I couldn't help but think that even Wild Man Fischer would have had more self-respect than to issue such drek.  Absolutely dreadful and should be avoided at all costs.
0	Great song but TERRIBLE sounding mp3.  Very low bit rate, only 48kbps!  Amazon should start listing the bit rate.  I will try to get refund for this one.
0	I do not care for the kidz bop franchise.  They play pop music with inappropriate lyrics encouraging sex and provocation. The only thing they have edited are the curse words but not the innuendo in the message.  You cant justify this being kids music simply because you've removed bathroom banter. Please reconsider the music you endorse kidz bop because clean may not be sexy for your bank statements but well-meaning, pure hearted lyrics are what I would appreciate most as a mom.
0	Would not suggest getting a song just because it is free.
0	This sucks! My mp3 conversion.that they recommed did not work! No music! No DL! No refund! Don't waste ur time! I rather go to iTunes!
0	My ears and brain cannot possibly listen as fast as the Caller calls!  You're doing one move and -  literally in two seconds or less - he calls ANOTHER move!  Seriously!  And the Caller sprinkles in little expressions but they get in the way of my frantic brain trying to pick out an actual call.  I attended a terrific square dance about five years ago and I had no trouble understanding and keeping up.  This cd is for EXPERIENCED, fast-comprehending-brains ONLY!  Cannot recommend.  I'm soooo bummed!  Got this for a Thanksgiving dance and now there's no time to replace.
0	very dark, and angry about his own love life
0	I'm not writing to complain about this single, I'm writing to complain about Amazon.  I accidentally ordered this CD instead of Prism so I went to my orders and canceled it.  It said that the cancellation couldn't be guaranteed so I immediately had Amazon call me so that I could explain the situation and they could cancel it for me.  The woman on the phone told me she couldn't cancel even though I had just ordered it within 5 minutes.  She said it was because it was already in the shipping process.  So now I have to go through the return process.  This is an inconvenience that I believe Amazon could of taken care of by just canceling the order.  I've been an Amazon customer since 2006 and Amazon has always provided good service but I don't appreciate the service I got involving this CD.
0	The song is longer. I thought i paid for the whole thing and was given only a single verse. Disappointed to say the least.
0	Love Groban's voice.  Very disappointed that it is one verse with the chorus repeated 4 times.  This song was written with 2 verses.  You'd do better to get the version by Selah.
0	I love the music,  But at the moment I can's seem to listen to ANY of my downloaded songs on my computer and I do not know why.
0	This cd didn't do much for me.  It has an interesting mix of performers but only a few songs really stood out.  Rachael Yamagata's "The River" is probably my favorite song on the album.  This up and coming singer really provided a beautiful version of this less familiar Christmas song.  Dido's "Christmas Day" is another beautiful song.  This seems to be the "go to" song for her when it comes to Christmas compilation albums, as I've heard it on other compilation albums.  Jerry Camp gives a nice rendition of "O Come All Ye Faithful."  He does justice to this Christmas Classic.  All in all this is not a bad album, it's just not that great either.  I wouldn't expect anyone to waste time hunting this album down but if you happen to come across it at a decent price I doubt you will regret purchasing it.
0	I really don't know what to say about this album. I wasn't expecting much, and for that I'm glad. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and I'll take David Gilmour over Roger Waters anyday. And I know it must have been hard working around the pre-recorded tracks from Rick Wright. But this album just doesn't offer or deliver anything. It's just bits and pieces, nothing coherent, no focus. No songs. There's just nothing to come back to. I think most folks will listen to it once and forget about it. I know thats what I'm going to do. To be honest, I'd rename it "Scraps of 20-Year-Old Leftovers" because in all honestly, that's what it is. Rather disappointing. I'm gonna go and listen to DSOTM now.
0	How can anyone be funny that doesn't like Lego, what a horrible stain on humanity, Spit.
0	If you're looking to purchase this to play at a party, don't bother. These are awful versions of the originals. Save yourself the embarrassment of being the joke of the party. You've been officially warned.
0	IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE THIS LP, OR LP COVER, I DIDN'T LIKE THE CONDITIONS THE ITEM WAS! SIMPLY! NOT AS DESCRIBE!
0	Gorgeous and performed with such feeling until it stops suddenly and ruins the whole thing for you. SO disappointing!
0	I can hear the audience noise better than the entertainer.  Sung in Hawaiian, not what I expected at all.
0	I like most Bob Rivers songs but I guess this one is over my head because I just don't get it.  It's not over the top funny like most of the other songs. I'm not really sure what the point of it is.  Definitely look up the lyrics before you buy it and make sure it's a song you want.  I would stick to the Bob Rivers Twisted Christmas songs personally.
0	I did not like this song the first time, by the hundredth (slight hyperbole) I hated it. It's annoying, monotonous, and unimagative. And here I thought you couldn't get worse than elevator music.
0	Edited version. It did not notify me that it was edited, nor can I find where to download the original version. I purchased this through the Amazon MP3 app
0	with no doubt in my mind this is the worst unplugged album I've seen. Katty Perry simply is a studio artist. Does not worth to see her live singing.  BAD BAD BAD
0	How do I return this?  It is a repetitive noise representing rain, sounded made up and  but as a music major of the past, I can tell the pattern is recycled, and some of the rain-pattern  ends with a tinny sound. tink tink. it went over that way three times. I had settled down for some sleep, I got more and more awake waiting for the "tink tink" and finally got irritated enough to jump out of bed and put the other one on (Music for Deep Sleep)and then I went to sleep.  Can someone tell me how to return this thing?  Thanks.
0	Not sure how, but the download of this album totally messed up my iPod touch. I had Apple personnel working on it, and nothing showed up when they reviewed the file, however, when I deleted the album from my library, I was able to partially correct some of the problems it caused.  I wish I had never downloaded this album.
0	The narrative was a bit too obscure for me and instead of relaxing, I spent my energy trying to figure out what he was talking about.
0	Very disappointed, I did not receive the photocards that are supposed to be included. I bought this for my daughter's birthday. She was so excited, but as I wached her open it I could tell she was crushed as she looked through the photo book and it became obvious that the promised photocards were not included. I would have given this 5 stars if not for that.
0	P!ATD really disappointed me with this album. the lyrics were mediocre and the music was bland. I know they're better than this genari
0	Is this a joke? Sounds like somebody sitting in the back corner of the dormitory lobby with her Yamaha acoustic. Ick!
0	Tried two different copies, both had numerous, small light scratches that caused clicks on more than one track. Both are going back.  In comparison I just bought 5 Black Sabbath albums - all were perfect.
0	I agree with some of the reviews, this CD is not up to parr for Susan Boyle and way over use of mixers and other electrical means to enhance what is not there. Can hardly hear Susan Boyle for all the noise. Really a bad CD and in my opinion will flop and do nothing to help Susan. Bad, Bad , Bad
0	is not the right cde do not order this crap
0	I thought I would like it but it is Just not my kinda music! Although I am sure others will enjoy it immensely.
0	Listening to this CD, all the way through, was neither easy nor enjoyable.  If you like beat-driven "pop" with repetitious lyrical hooks, you might like '0304'.  If you are expecting to be touched by another excellent Jewel collection, prepare to have your heart broken.  This CD truly disappointed everyone I know who has heard it.  It is pure "pop" drivel.
0	What we have here is a group who call themselves Unlimited beat and who have taken some of the best pop songs ever produced and moulded them into dance doo doo.  First of all folks, george michael is no where to be found on this CD.  In fact, if I were him I would scream bloody murder for waht these dolts did with my songs.  The whole Cd has three tracks, a short medley of michael's hits both WHAM! and without, a long version of the same songs and an instrumental track that sounds remotely like Donna Sommer's "I Feel Love" That's it!  Waht really got to me though is the exposition of the songs.  The spin they put on them was one of their own and a bit mocking style.  Noteably "I Want your Sex" which they leave out the suttle refrrences to bisexuality; can't have singing about that after all.  I think it was very homophobic of them to do so.  Second, last Christmas is stripped down to a dumb dance ditty and why on earth did they start the medley with "Jesus to a child?" Finally, what was the third track for?  It has nothing to do with George michael.  Trust me people don't buy this garbage
0	Sounds old. Needs clearing some of the background noise.
0	It's OK to be a pretender when you're acting, but not when making music. Stick to acting.
0	Dierks career continues to be highjacked by subpar songs.  The guy is incredibly talented but the song selection continues to lag.  At least my kids know what the popo is now.
0	I was expecting this new album to sound a bit more "softer" than Bionic, but most of all I was hoping that this loudness war would be over, instead this album, just like Bionic, sounds really horrible. The levels have been raised to the max, the sounds is often distorted and really detracts from the listening pleasure. It is almost shocking when I play Back To Basics, her last album to sound NORMAL, and really let her powerful voice shine through. Lotus, besides sounding horrible for the reason I just mentioned, is one out of hundreds of generic pop albums published in the last years. There seems to be nothing special about it to make it stand out, it is actually worse and less imaginative than album released by unknown artists. I expected more, and better. Again, congratulations to RCA for lowering the bar on music quality once more. This album is aimed at audiences who usually download illegally and don't care about the quality of the music. But why would someone spend 14 USD on an album of music whose quality is the same as bad downloads?
0	Armani Exchange (stores) present DJ Frankie Knuckles in this 2003 release which previously and originally was released in England during 2002 by Freetown Records of London. So, these are 2001 - 2002 beats and unfortunately  far from contemporary "house" sound, which Frankie pioneered during the 1970s. None of the eleven tracks are noteworthy unless you are a superfan of Kerri Chandler. But, the basic problem is that Frankie never arcs the BPMs and so this album monotonously moves from track one to eleven without taking you higher. I guess Frankie Knuckles fans will want this historic memento but house fans should save their money for better albums.
0	This record is not what it claims to be. According to the excerpts on the listing, this is not the 1812 Overture. The record was clearly mislabeled by the manufacturer. With this in mind, it should be withdrawn from sale.
0	I can't get my purchase into my iTunes library. Frustrated.
0	Never received download. Again. Unable to rate.
0	uninstalled this one. I thought this was my comments  but this thing requires a certain amount of words (20) to give feedback. Stupid! what do you think?
0	I can't really review this CD, because it was a Christmas gift for my daughter
0	Not a fan of this one at all. The music overpowered the vocals and when i could hear the lyrics, they sounded like she was mumbling.
0	skimpy music. see my other review of Mr. Anderson album.
0	Love Barbra not a great album at all
0	This is a crock. The Roundhouse 1978, with Overkill and Breaking the Law. don't make me laugh.  Overkill wasn't released until 79, and Breaking the law wasn't released until 1980.  Go buy the original live albums.
0	Sound balance and recording quality appalling.
0	the performance of he 'Badenweiler March' is not really bad, but the sound-quality of the recording is very poor. Sounds like it has been duplicated over and over.  Not much dynamic, esp low tones are missing
0	Not the explicit version. Turns songs by Nick Jonas in to Jonas Brothers quality.
0	There are long gaps with little if any sound in this recording, and other spots that have repetitive, harsh, loud insect-type noises.  Might be good if you want to actually feel like you're in the desert; not so good for me just trying to block out the sounds of others' conversations and get on with my work.  I find the insect noises very distracting, and only found about 25 minutes of this track that suit my needs.
0	I have all Chris Isaak's records. This isn't the worst (that would have to be Always Got Tonight) but it's not one of his best either. There are some mediocre songs and some good songs, but even the good songs are marred by lackluster arrangements. Down in Flames is a perfect example. That could have been a real stomper! Instead it sounds like elevator music. If you're new to Isaak please don't start with this one. Get your hands on Forever Blue and Heart Shaped World. If you're a long-time fan you probably already bought it, so why are you reading reviews anyway?
0	After a couple of days, song refused to play. Had to download from another server.
0	Ok track, but nothing special and no where near Rihanna's best work!
0	Amazon seriously should not be selling anything of this nature
0	It's a night in a forest of crickets.  There are no other sounds - just crickets with no variation for the entire CD.
0	Honestly, I am very upset at how very poor many girl groups have came together and lagged on the chemistry their voices have shown at the soul overall. It is just too sad that they haven't shown enough chemistry in regards to a song being more everlasting at the soul, and just sounds more like a fad eventually going away. That has honestly happened so often with a lot of girl groups from the Pussycat Dolls and others losing their career focus, and will only have maybe at least one song to stand the test of time alone. Unfortunately for Fifth Harmony, they have been really lagging in regards to better songs, and not showing individual harmonies and chemistry at the soul. They did barely show it with Write On Me from their 7/27 album. Work From Home though isn't actually a driven song that ignites from the heart, and the song just drags down overall. I didn't like the song at the very end, and the gals definitely haven't really been able to learn from their first set of songs like Worth It & Sledgehammer. Hopefully, there will be much better from them down the road.  Song: D+
0	This is not the good version that I thought it was! I am sorry I bought it, wasted my .99 :-(
0	I heard nothing compelling on the samples, so I didn't download anything. I would rather sit quietly in my garage than listen to this garage and garbage montage. Another reviewer noted that Indy sets such as this have a tendency to contain Dylanesque wannabees. Well, you don't need a weatherman to know the way this set blows.
0	I love toccata and fugue but when I purchased this particular one, the little preview clip they let you listen too was deceiving: not only is the song a lot shorter than I remember, it's also REALLY fast. That was my problem with it; if only you could slow it down do that one could actually hear the song and recognize its distinctive and often pretty parts. This version goes so fast that the song is utterly ruined and almost all enjoyment of it is destroyed. I gave it a 2 star rating becsuse it isn't complete garbage:; and I'll still listen to it, but I'll also hate looking at that ugly cover art that's for sure.
0	Everyone say that Ride The Lightning is Metallica's flawless album and that it was their best.  Well, I think that Ride The Lightning is totally over rated, because it has the worst songs that Metallica ever made put into one CD.  The only good song that is on this album is Fight Fire With Fire and Ride the Lightning.  Everything else is terrible to the max.
0	I do not like movies like this.  Therefore I would have never ordered this. I am not sure what was going on when this came on my account.  I do not have a kindle.
0	Bad rip. The first few seconds of this piece, at the first choral entrance, are cut off.  Amazon needs to re-rip this track and replace the current defective version.  The recording itself is wonderful - just a bad MP3 rip from Amazon.
0	These are okay knock-offs - but keep in mind that these are NOT the original hit versions of these recordings.
0	I owned this record back in the day when it came out.  I loved it and got it to get the version of Bluebird that can't be found elsewhere.  The issue is - while the seller states that the product is "Very Good" and that the Vinyl is "Basically Unplayed"  Well - we definitely have two opinions of "Basically Unplayed"  the dust scratches were so plentiful that you could barely hear the music.  Would not buy from this dealer again
0	Not really sold on it I  guess. It was a little annoying actually after the second time I listened to it.
0	Disappointed. not what I expected.  Just doen't sound celtic to me.
0	Simply put, this is Monster Magnet's weakest album to date. The songs don't stand up to anything that came before it. If you are new to Monster Magnet get any of their earlier albums and leave this one on the shelf.
0	I thought this item would be a little better than what it was. But it's. Okay.
0	they don't pay me to lie / i am a wayne fan  but not a fan of this  album ? what happen
0	9 songs under 2 minuets, 5 songs 3 minuets or less, and only 4 songs that are 4 minuets or more. They should be ashamed of themselves for putting such a high price on this CD. Do yourself a favor and listen to it before you spend your hard earned cash on it. Vary disappointed after seeing that there was 18 songs on the back cover to find out a lot of it is not really songs at all.
0	I ordered Back to Black D01-6965081-0833057 and D01-3975423-5268261 Tainted Love and can't open either item on my I Tunes.  These do not show up anywhere. Please credit my account .99cents and 7.99 Mary Imre
0	Well seeing as the review and band information all refers to Emery the hardcore/emo band and this CD is by emery pike Id say Im not pleased. I feel missled and gyped.
0	No music involved.  All tracks consist of a couple of long tones. I removed it from my computer.
0	I never got the song to download in any condition that could be played. I'd like to think I'm an optimist because I keep trying to download music from Amazon. Actually I am beginning to believe that it is more stupidity than optimism.
0	I don't think this song is great, just not really my taste. I thought it would be good for blues dancing to, but it isn't particularly.
0	Cd plays nothing. Want my money back asap
0	Was not the whole track, just a snippet
0	The other reviewer is right. This seems to be the wrong CD. The cover art here shows Funky Chicken not Big Youth.  The mp3 downloads are correct. The CD is not! I looked at some of the sellers. It appears to be Funky Chicken not Hit the Road Jack.
0	This isn't the radio version; the one where the intro goes "Shana-na-na. the re-flex."  This version has an instrumental as the intro.
0	while i consider his first album a masterpiece, this one i can hardly listen to. only 2 songs work for me, those being "so strong" and "rock stone". everything else is an instant skip.
0	Minimalist music, boring, repetitive rhythm.  She has a decent voice, but the vehicle was poor for the showcase of her talent.
0	Received a "sealed" copy of this as a Christmas gift, and Disc 1 was missing.  You ought to be more careful when you re-seal used merchandise and try to pass it off as new.  Also, the outer slipcase was missing.
0	I downloaded this because it gets stuck in my head all the time. Its not good. If you haven't heard it, don't start now. Its a pop classic, with breathy vocals and lame creepy lyrics.
0	Generic and uninspired. I listed to a number of the tracks they were awful at best. At worst, the music was nearly as disgusting as Leslie Rasmussen's letter in support of her friend, rapist Brock Turner. She blamed an innocent woman for being drunk while violently raped, but won't take responsibility for putting such bad music out into the world?
0	This mp3 song is not the same song I remember. This edition is not as good either. I had sampled the other mp3 in Amazon and the samples all sounded the same.
0	The pressing is terrible. i had to return it 2 times.  Both times the albums were defective straight from the factory. stay away from the vinyl pressing of this.
0	I could do without the anti-Trump sentiment. I am disappolnted. I returned it.
0	I should have looked closer, this is a live song. I don't like live songs. It was my fault, but I bought it so I will review it, hopefully it helps people from making the same mistake I did.
0	Jonathan Black, you disgust me.  This song sucked, was stupid, and is plain wack.  0 stars.
0	I'm a big fan of avant-garde composers, but this is an absolutely horrid piece of music. A sort of "opera" based on a fictional story of a woman who almost singlehandedly bankrupts the world before dying mysteriously in prison, all of the tracks on the 62-minute CD (all segued together) are built around repetitive electronic ostanati backing up tuneless and almost unintelligible "singing". Although Robert Ashley's notes say that the work is lighthearted, it sounds very ominous and almost demonic. Anyone with a synthesizer could have composed this piece, and as for singing the libretto, being able to carry a tune is not a prerequisite. Not all of the tracks are in the same key, but there are no chord progressions to speak of. Each "movement" stays on one chord in the same pulsating triple meter. Listening to the 30-second samples of each track will tell you everything you need to know about it. Don't waste your money or a single moment of your life on this. Just say Goodbye without saying Hello.
0	The song isn't complete - terminates early.
0	one star for having the guts to record a song that is that bad. I could do better by farting in a microphone and enhancing it with the same software.
0	It was not what I expected and thank you for returning my money.
0	I love the song but unhappy to the fact that I had to purchase the song in order to add it to my playlist.
0	Straight off the heels of such socially and spiritually enriched songs such as "Prayer of a Common Man" and "This Crazy Life," it's understandable that Vassar needs to re-invent himself.  But does he have to stoop this low to sing about a brutish truck driver who dolls himself up as a woman and calls himself "Bobbi" at night? Most grating about this song is what's the point?  If this song is to make a social statement about homosexuality, then it fails terribly.  This is because all Vassar has to say in response to "Bobbi" is: "we live and let live, that's how it is/nobody gives a second thought these days."  If the purpose of the song is for its shock value, then again it panders. There's nothing really engaging about its melody or message that put a new spin on this issue.  Nevertheless, it makes one wonder: is this the same Vassar who penned such richly textured tunes such as the aforementioned "Prayer of a Common Man" and "In a Real Love"?
0	These guys are done bit if you are into progressive romantic ballads this is the album for you.
0	Awful message, offensive song, divisive, intolerant.  In a word, all the things she would call those with a different point of view.  Glad I heard this before I picked up the album. One fan down. in search of more introspective and enlightened voices.
0	So, if I "steal" a song by ripping a CD from the library, that's theft, and I'm a terrible person. When FOX (a member of the RIAA) does it, JoCo should get down on his knees and thank them for the exposure of the resulting controversy. And people say you can't buy justice these days. Then again, maybe JoCo should read Cracked's explaination of why he should thank Fox ([.])
0	When Steve Earle dubbed Shania Twain "America's best paid lap dancer," one wonders whether even he could have anticipated the music industry's latest conversion. As if there weren't enough "singers" on the scene turning pop music into a boozy night at Hooters, here comes Jewel, the once quasi-sincere folk artist turned "rock's sexiest poet," as the current issue of Blender Magazine tags her. Anyone unaware of the bottomless depths to which the pop music machine is willing to sink for an extra few bucks might consider that particular rag's cover, showcasing Jewel's celebrity makeover as she smirks and leans against a wall in as lascivious a pose as the Alaskan-born "songwriter" could conjure, clad from head to toe in leather and sleezy lingerie. If that isn't enough of an education, then the leather glove on her right hand exposing a few bare, tan fingers is sure to strike you as oh-so-irresistible. If you do actually pick up a copy of the magazine, don't blame yourself for expecting a story on Jewel's favorite S & M maneuvers. And, just in case you were wondering, each photo accompanying the article itself is captioned by a list of all the fancy fashion designers whose fishnets and high heels she's wearing. Some of the brand names, such as New York's "Trashy Lingerie,"  and L.A.'s "Retail Slut," seem hysterically appropriate. Apparently, Jewel's 11-million selling debut album of refreshingly understated and heartfelt folk tunes, followed by a few more platinum collections of largely similar material, wasn't providing enough of a financial cushion. After all, if you think you've got problems footing that mortgage bill and car payment, try keeping up with a mansion and insatiable wardrobe. It's tough being Jewel. Really. Indeed, this is only the latest of several conspicuous leaps taken by talented artists into the surely profitable realm of pop trash and veritable prostitution, Sheryl Crow's abysmal C'mon, C'mon being the most notable example in recent years. Panicking at comparatively "weak" record sales as of late, Jewel's entourage  put together a recipe for renewal. It goes something like this: extract any semblance of intelligence or tact, dumb down the lyrics because, you know, most people are just morons anyway, and, oh yeah,  take her clothes off, and voila! You've got sales! One wonders whether Jewel's billed persona as a once-homeless songwriter risen improbably to the top of the world with no more assistance than a guitar, a voice, and a few good lines, has ever really been much more than a pose. The wistful and phenomenally successful Pieces of You offered some reason to believe that Jewel was indeed representative of the proverbial starving poet gone from rags to riches, but creative efforts that followed did little to further that image. In the introduction to her million-selling book of verse, the poetically titled A Night Without Armor, Jewel cites increasingly legendary American poet, Charles Bukowski, as an influence on her own work, but is it any wonder, really, that Bukowski's name appeared misspelled? Universally panned in countless reviews, A Night Without Armor serves as poetry's equivalent to Daniel Steele and is the butt of many a joke in classrooms of MFA programs around the country. "I miss you miserably, dear / and I can't quite manage / to face this unbearably / large bed / alone," Jewel writes in one of the book's many prosaic self-indulgences. Surely, this is no Patti Smith. Now, though, we have 0304 to consider, a fabulously mindless foray into precisely the kind of soupy production and mindlessness to which Jewel's former repute seemed the ultimate antithesis. Apparently impressed by fellow pop product Avril Lavinge's knack for clever song titles, i.e., "Sk8er Boi," Jewel serves up one hell of a track listing, with songs like "Run 2 U," "2 Find U," "Yes U Can," 2 Become 1" and the award-winning "U & Me =Love," the mathematical spelling for "sell out." To cap it off, the album's title, reminiscent of Billy Idol's 1993 bomb, Cyberpunk, is a rather less than subtle nod to the "simple girl in a digital world" (uh, Madonna, is that you?!) about whom Jewel sings throughout the album. Just as Idol attempted to capture in music the early-90's cultural phenomenon coined by William Gibson, Jewel's newfound gig is an utterly hip internet age image being sold to an exclusively teeny bopper audience. It is likely to sell far better than Idol's tragic swansong, but if it does, the success will be attributable to nothing more than keen marketing. The writing here demonstrates no interest whatever in disputing the ill reception with which A Night Without Armor was greeted. Granted, lots of boys will be drooling for Jewel while reaching for the Vaseline jar before long, but even they are unlikely to mistake the monotonous and desperate single, "Intuition," for the work of a "poet." Lines such as "just follow your heart baby" and "If you want my love, you can try my love, you can buy my love, just take my hand" aren't exactly Shakespeare. Amid Jewel's newfound cloak of sex and glitter, attempts at political observation like the opening track, "Stand," seem as incongruous as they are stale, turning in clich&eacute;s for cash. "Together we can make a stand," she reminds us. One can almost envision David Crosby heaving into his coffee. Suddenly, it seems so long ago that the charming rookie songster, Tracy Chapman, was Takin' `Bout A Revolution. "Kate Moss can't find a job," Jewel croons on "Stand." Well, here is an "intuition" of my own: any self-respecting listener who makes it beyond the first half of this album will likely be wishing something worse than unemployment on Jewel, America's most literate lingerie model.
0	Unfortunately, this is another product which I never ordered and wonder how it got into my music.  This is a great disappointment.
0	Some people just sing flat you know.  There are winners and there are losers.  That is just life and whoever doles out the talent, you just gotta ask him why?
0	no way to return this, it is worthless to me and not what I ordered which was Organ Sonata #8 by Felix Guilmont
0	It wasn't squeaky clean (ahh s*%$), when Biggie comes in.
0	Beging desperate for new music,  this album was written up in some magazine as being good.  I had never owned any thing by Bob Dylan so I gambled and ordered it.  I will NEVER buy anything by Dylan and probable will just junk this one.
0	Rip off, this isn't an album just a remixed song or two.
0	Does not even sound like the song I know he wrote! It sounds like they tried to jazz it up.
0	Disappointed that the CD case was cracked but thankfully the CD was not damaged.
0	Had a picture of the Manhattans with Gerald Alston, yet he  was no where to be found on the album.
0	The original "Knockin Boots" was a direct sample of Betty Wright's "Tonight is the Night".  This is not the same beat, it has no bassline or real rhythm.
0	Not nearly as good as the newest release.  Sorry I ordered it, but I still adore the group and will continue seeing them live.
0	I really loved Ry's work but to throw Mitt under the bus and quote Sharpton (racial ambulance chaser) with a quote about a dog is really funny. Just what we need another muscian who turns politician, worked really well for John Kerry.  hopefully the O man gets beat so we can get the country back to normal and ry putting out good music again.  oh, by the way this CD sounds like he mailed it in. too bad.
0	This is a babyish song. It's also annoying. BUT it is VERY good for children Dutch as todlers. That's why I gave it a two and not an one.
0	. but this is sub par in comparison to the first two albums, especially the first.  I waited 4 weeks for the first album to arrive, and was so pleased.  When this came out, I burnt it and forced myself to try and like it.  Instead, I found I can tolerate it only as background music.  I knew this would happen.  Although Chris Corner is an amazing musician and lyricist, it is the rest of the Sneaker Pimps that keep him balanced, and Ian Pickering's help with lyrics that solidifies the songs.  The first IAMX album had warm, dark synths with a tasteful minimalist complexity.  I understand that doesn't make much sense, but that is exactly why it was so good.  I am sure all of Chris's militant offspring will mark this review down, but just go and listen to the differences yourself.  By the time you get done you will feel like you got mugged in an alley by the overused compress drums and that lead synth I've come to hate so much.  I am not even saying Kingdom of Welcome Addiction is generally that bad, it just is for an IAMX album
0	This is NOT a piece of music.  It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.  Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
0	This naive pig has hired LILO Brancato to perform in her music video.  He was responsible for the death on NYPD Officer Daniel Enchautegui.  [.]
0	I still have not had time to hear what I bought yet. So my rating is for song titles only. got a go some one needs me.
0	First of all, I love the Flaming Lips, or the Lips as us hardcore fans call them.  I've been listening to them ever since their early days when they debuted with "Yoshirmi Versus the Pink Robots".  That album combined all the things I loved about anime and having a short attention-span into one great disc (a burnt disc, since record stores like Best Buy are too xxxpensive, GAW!).  Anyways, I also loooove the Beatles.  After I got their album "1", I decided to check out some of their older stuff too.  One of those was the iTunes deluxe version of "Sergeant Peppers Lone Hearts Club Band Army".  At first when I heard it I was all like, "Whuh?" I was all like, "Huh?"  "Wheres that clapping coming from".  It definitely made me know what it was like to be on hard drugs.  It wasn't packed full of great hits like "1" or "Across the Universe" but it grew on me, cause I was growing as a music fan, what with going to see cool bands at festivals.  Anyways, you can imagined how thrilled I was to hear the Lips were coming out with a Beatles "Sgt. Peppers" tribute.  I mean, what next?!?! A tour together!?!?  Well, my hopes were dashed because this album is straight up NOIZE! I mean, GAW! I wish it sounded exactly like the original! That's what I wanted! GAW!  I can't believe the Beatles aren't suing!?!?!?! And, to make matters worse, it has POP music stars like MILEY CYRUS on it! GAW! I hate pop music! I'm into real musicians, and Miley is NOT a real musician.  In fact, bands like the Lips and the Beatles are supposed to be the opposite of pop music cause they are so much better.  Anyways, this album sounds nothing like the original masterpeace Sgt. Peppers.  And if you are going to do a tribute, it shoudl sound like the original.  I guess my main issue with this album is, other than it's waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to wieeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrd for listening, is that it doesn't sound like the original.  GAW!
0	at  first i was checking to see what they might go as they have been pretty cool with their folk brand of pop music.  however this album feels are odinary for radio play. sorted like they are settling for being a rascal flats of folk pop.  it  gets  real watered down and plan in a hurry. Mumford and Sons needs some  Sanford and Son in their lives in that they need to switch up lanes and get a new groove going.
0	I could not play it so I an not happy with it
0	H3H3 criticized his work and got sued for it, grade A piece of s* here.
0	The artists listed for this album, Monster New Wave Hits, is identified as A Flock of Seagulls online. But when playing the selection it does NOT sound like the original artists, and the media player identifies them as "various artists". I believe it's a knockoff imitation, and probably the other "hits" are as well. BEWARE.
0	Long dreary. Similiar sounds.  Looking for more of him. I'll try again.
0	heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping. it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review. i guess it's perfect for a furniture store: bland, generic, and soporific
0	nothing special of course. just like her other songs it sucks as usual. Isn't your 15 mins up by now?
0	I ordered this CD from BMV here on Amazon, paid much more than the downloadable files (something like $14.95), and when it arrived and played it on my computer, the file clearly stated "Subliminal Spanish".  Not saying that they don't really have an actual subliminal Tlingit recording available, but just be careful about what you order.  And check out what the files on the CDs or mp3 say they are.
0	I have no idea how I got this. I didn't order it and am a loss why anyone would give it to me.
0	I have a ton of respect for Joan Jeanrenaud, but I found very little to like in this lengthy droning, chirping work.  I guess I expected more "cello" in the mix. There are plenty of birds - not the soothing tweets of an ambient "forest sounds" type track, but relatively aggressive-sounding chirps and squawks. There are also planes - jets and propeller planes drowning out the soundscape every few minutes as they fly by.  But there is little cello that is easily recognizable as such. Don't be fooled by the sample, which from the earlier, more musical minutes of the track. The cello soon settles into a very deep drone, such that you can't tell whether it's a musical instrument or some kind of industrial machinery run through studio effects. There are also some higher-pitched grating and wheezing notes that I assume are from the cello that come more to the foreground at times.  I was expecting something more musical. Avant-garde, to be sure, but musical. If you laugh in the face of musical convention and regard the need for music to contain notes that go beyond droning and wheezing as bourgeois and/or peasant-like, this is for you.  I do feel I came to this work with an open mind and sense of adventure. I give it two stars for its spirit in defying convention, but I know I won't be listening again.
0	I have been a fan of the Innocence Mission since their first album . Karen has one of the most hauntingly beautiful voices I have ever heard.  Umbrella is one of my top ten albums.  When Karen's brother began the production duties the quality of the recordings became abysmal. Her voice, and song writing have become beaten down by 3rd rate production.  I have tried of so hard to like these albums, but I am unable to get past the "sound" that has dwarfed her.  I lament the loss of a truly great talent and can only imagine what could have been
0	One of the worst pieces of garbage I ever purchased, Love The Stones but this particular recording was SOOO BAD you can barely make out the music. Whoever recorded it must have been sitting in the audience with a portable cassette recorder. I put that cd where it belongs, in the trash!
0	got billed for the music but it never downloaded.
0	People still use Holosync? You can literally make your own "Holosync" with Neuro Programmer 3. Just go to [.] "Holosync" is not a technology, it's just a brand name. The only thing Holosync does is lower the binaural beat pitch and you can do that using Neuro Programmer 3. Holosync is a complete rip-off. Don't be fooled. I find it amazing that people take offense to this revelation. You tell them that they're getting scammed and they get upset with you. Don't be one of "those" person's. Educate yourself and be smart.
0	Amy's music is far from my taste. Waist of  money. Another overinflated star. A very good voice but she did  not use it for better level songs. The reviews induced me in error.
0	Downloads ask for last disk.  Unworkable.
0	The description says this song is performed by Eric Carmen, but it's not.  If you are looking for the Eric Carmen version, don't purchase this.
0	This album wouldn't irritate quite as much as it does now if it didn't seem like everybody but me enjoyes it. Not only are they unoriginal, the lyrics and versitality have reached an all time low. Sum 41 sings to pleasant pop tunes that they like making fun of people, they don't want to wake up, they have no motivation, and they are mad at their parents for making them do homework. This is good music for all the early teenagers who are in "rebellion" against their parents. Furthermore this album is about 40 minutes long. all the songs sound the same and the longest song is 3:02 minutes and there is nary a guitar solo in the entire Cd. Oh Well. I'm sure that they will fade into obscurity within the decade. Anyways. I'm not a complete pop-punk hater. the self titled Blink 182 album wasn't that bad.
0	Great version of this tune. This and Dread Zeppelin's version are both very cool for different reasons. However, it is fuzzy sounding, and doesn't quite play through to the end chopping off about 5 seconds. I will try to get a refund. It is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credits of the movie. The visuals add more than you can know.
0	Unfortunately, only 2 songs here are worth listening too. the first and last, "I Think We're Alone Now", and "Could've Been".  I guess this is what happens when you don't compose your own songs like  Debbie does. Kinda' a disappointment.
0	This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!
0	Great Song that's ruined by Ms Aguilera
0	For some reason my mom wants to learn to yodel. She LOVES this cd. I only gave it one star because now she won't stop yodeling. She even had my niece and nephew doing it. I am irritated.
0	Well this album rejuvenated rock and destroyed it as fast as it appeared. Kurt Cobain was not a tortured soul as many believe, he was a druggy who could not get his life together, did not want to be mainstream, yet he became. He killed himself to take the cowards way out, or maybe he was so high, he used his shotgun as a pipe and accidentally ignited the bullet that killed them. He was not a guitar hero, he barely played it in this album, the bass was only audiblw because Kurt could not play that well, yet the bass was boring and subpar. And the songs were written by a crack addict with inaudible singing and awful writing.  The only positive thing about Nirvana was Dave Grohl, his drumming was that made the band, quick, exploding drumming. At least he had the real talent in the band.
0	I wanted the clean version and it's not clean at all.
0	This is actually just a boring 2 star album, but I just placed it as 1-star because it is a complete copycat of The Band Perry's first record (album cover). If you actually look at The Band Perry's first album cover and this, they look EXACTLY the same, which often makes the album boring and very hard to like. The Band Perry may not be so bright with "If I Die Young", but at least they actually have what it takes to make redeeming songs. This is a complete copycat. If that doesn't make you think "WHY IS THIS EVEN A CD", listen to the music. It's all just crummy bluegrass-influenced country and NO interesting country pop like songs, and actually (like i said) copys the descent bluegrass of The Band Perry. So, it's not that hard to say that the Janedear Girls aren't the only ones to pull this copycat and ripoff nonsense. This is a warning to PREFER THE BAND PERRY OVER THIS.
0	My husband likes this band, but did not enjoy this CD.  I will have to find a better selection of their songs.
0	A double cd ,Disc one made up from old radio airchecks Disc two. a much later recording of Helen Forrest without Artie Shaw Not at all what was advertised
0	This is a sweet and fun show with a sweet and fun score - it plays beautifully. Unfortunately, this recording is so bad that it actually does a disservice to the author and the material. Instead of recording the Cabrini College (?) cast, the producers would have been wiser to get professional performers in a studio for an afternoon. The vocals are under rehearsed and off-key much of the time. This effort is amateurish at best. If you are considering doing a production of this musical, please don't let this recording dissuade you.
0	I only liked one song.  Don't buy it if you only like Need You Now.  Not worth it.
0	I love Lizz Wright- have seen her live six times.  She has this presence on stage that is all emcompassing- she is the spiritual force that wraps her soul around your heart and won't let go. She doesn't perform the music- she radiates it.  Not to mention her superior contralto talent that will send you through the ceiling- and oh those soft higher notes too.  With that said, "Salt" is the vibe I love-"Dreaming Wide Awake" is a close second.  I love "Orchard" for the variety even though it is different from the first two mentioned.  "Fellowship", I can't even listen to it.  What a huge let down.  Something is missing. I am open to all types of music, but it is hard to find the groove on this one.  Lizz pls come home to your earlier vibes.
0	Sounds like the original Beatles or Byrds got together and wrote another late 60's ballad. Truly terrible. Also, Amazon's audio quality of this recording (which we are FORCED to listen to while on customer support hold) makes the song truly un-listenable. If I were this artist, I'd demand Amazon fix their audio garbling issue before allowing them to play my song on hold. AND IT REPEATS FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER AND EVER.
0	Unintelligible lyrics at excessive volume
0	I would not even download it for free.  This is another example of why "country" music is so horrible today.  It is no longer "country" music, it is just pop with slide guitars.  Johny Cash is rolling over in his grave, Willie Nelson is smoking more and more to drown out this junk, and Hank Williams is yodeling louder and louder to not have to hear this.
0	Incredibly disappointed.  Similar to Periphery's new albums, this one has me scratching my head and wondering what is happening to metal.  Short of a couple songs, this entire album feels geared towards pop radio.  "No knock" and "Tru-kvlt-metal" are decent, but the rest were not just meh, but bad.  I wasn't expecting another 'The Fall of Ideals' from a metal standpoint, but wow, even AWYCW had more flare and energy than this album.  Really disappointed with this entire album.  Grab "No knock" and "Tru-kvlt-metal" as MP3s.  The rest aren't worth your time or money.
0	There is a guttural harshness to Byzantine chant, as compared to Roman.
0	one of my favorites,  me and one of my trucks was in smokey and the bandit 2 with jerry reed so I knew him personally.
0	this cd is awful. Production is lousy, music is dull and boring. there is no point to this whole undertaking. it's just not good.
0	Agreed - this is a con.  I know the music extremely well and these cuts were pulled off of other RELEASED albums.
0	Play it when you're down, play it when you want to encourage someone else.  PLAY  IT!  This is well-done, and lyrics are easily understood.  Don't miss the encouragement you can receive.
0	This "song" is the worst that I have ever heard. And for Sam Hunt, that's impressive.  He doesn't even sing the majority of the song!  It's him talking for a little bit while strumming disinterestedly, follow by a few words that he sings.  Honestly this song sucks
0	The Endless River, the "new" Pink Floyd album seems more like a bonus disc that would accompany a rerelease of "The Division Bell" than it does a brand new Floyd record.  Usually I listen to a bonus disc, as I did with Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall once or twice than put it back in it's case and forget about it while still enjoying the original content.  The first side of the record struck me as a discount version of "Shine on You Crazy Diamond" before morphing into a discount version of "Welcome to the Machine".  C'mon, you can't tell me those chords don't sound familiar.  Sound effects from previous Floyd recordings are recycled throughout making it seem less new.  Finally, the last song on the album is the only one to contain lyrics.  It's called "Louder than Words" and is perhaps the worse song Pink Floyd has ever released.  The lyrics are juvenile and the intro guitar but sounds as if it were lifted from a Queensryche track called "Waiting For 22".  Peace.
0	Love the album but every side was damaged and does not play well.
0	Not, as good as their latest album.  However, if you prefer more emo or punkish rock than this my be up your alley.  simply because the intonation of the singer(he's to whiney).
0	Kind of an industrial-electronic vibe.  Scarier than half the specially-made Halloween tracks that come out this time of year, but I don't think that was their intent.  Not my cup of tea, good I suppose if you want to know what it would be like to live inside a bunch of factory machinery or be in the mind of a psycho-killer.
0	First class conducting from the late Hans Vonk in excellent live sound, marred by very ordinary, mediocre solo singing. There are many better sung versions of this masterpiece, performed by singers of real character and distinction. This is enjoyable as a provincial live performance but never as a recording to be repeatedly played, Mr Wobble is no Ochs alongside Moll, Edelmann, Jungwirth or Berry and the sopranos are merely competent. The tenor is poor, too.
0	Awful.  Could do so much better.  Though she can sing, she sounds are too repetitive and unoriginal.  She needs to look for ways to mature
0	I don't even know what this is.  I didn't order anything that looks like this.  I did not receive anything that looks like this,  and a far as I know, I never paid for anything that looks like this.  Maybe you can let me know what it is and I May give it a better rating.
0	My Blu-Ray edition arrived this afternoon and I just listened to/watched it, including the "bonus" audio and video tracks.  I am definitely a fan of Dark Side of the Moon, all the post-Waters Floyd, and David Gilmour's solo efforts,  That said, the Endless River left me flat and bored.  I like "ambient" music but this is just a bunch of crud strung together with no theme and no developing or evolving structure.  I wasted my time listening to it and definitely wasted my money buying it.  YMMV.  Postscript: The Blu-Ray version specs the stereo output at 96kHz both on the packaging and in the on-screen setup options.  My PerfectWave MKII DAC is displaying 48kHz which is the spec for the DVD version. I double-checked my Oppo player and the output is correctly set to 96kHz LPCM.  I purchased the Blu-Ray version specifically for the higher resolution and I didn't even get that!
0	The one song on it sounded quite tinny.  Not good.  Poor quality.  I wouldn't buy this and neither should you.
0	A very contemplative score. Quite haunting.  Beautifully played.  After listening to this work, the music keeps playing in your mind.
0	This is NOT the song we all grew to know and love.  The real version CAN be found here on Amazon.  This one is not it.
0	The music is wonderful. Good quality. What I did not like was the condition of the the CD when it arrived. The outside plastic part (the holder) was in pieces when I opened it. Fortunately, the actual CD was in good condition, but not the holder.
0	The problem with this CD is all the songs sounded very similar.  Not enough variety.  The songs were not very relaxing or soothing.
0	love this recording however the file plays a such a low  volume its unlistenable no matter how much you turn it up. very disappointing, there is no way of knowing when you by it
0	"stink  `roid"  have  released  a  disappointing  overpriced snooze  fest  of a  2 x  LP set Much  of the  vinyl consists  of large  blank  run out  grooves .In fact those are the best tracks!. It  could have all fit  onto one LP! .Even then it  would have  been  a case of  "careful with  that elevator  Eugene".   If you  love Pink Floyd  records  such  as ' Wish  you were here', 'Meddle', 'The  Final Cut', 'Atom Heart Mother'  and  'Animals'  then  avoid this  stinker  at all costs. Whispering  Dave and the Floyd tones  have one  vocal tune  on this  release and  it  is a  dud.  Roger  Waters'  solo stuff  has  aged  very  well  compared with  the  Water-less  'Pink Floyd as  a  brand name '  releases.
0	Needless to say, the guy who said the title was Mis-leading was a huge understatement. it has nothing to do with Relaxing Music. It's a complete waste of money even though it was not that much for 99 so called songs. I listened for 30 minutes, threw the Mp3 CD in the garbage. I only got 96 songs on a Mp3 formatted disc.
0	Why does every rapper want to be the devil?  Did you know:  he is responsible for the deaths of your homies.  he hates you too.  he's afraid of the mere mentioning of the name JESUS.  will inevitably die, no chance in rewriting the prophecies.  lost in the fight against GOD, have fun following a loser, ha!  the album is average.
0	The Amazon cloud player is a piece of crap.  Don't buy MP3s from Amazon - it's not worth it. It crashed several times trying to get the file to 'download'.  I eventually quit trying after working at it about 30 minutes.
0	I absolutley hate Black eyed Peas.  Without their autotune they wouldnt be able to stay in key.  They don't write their music!  What do they do besides stand on stage and dance around like a bunch of jackwaggits.  Really. this is what they are calling music these days?  This band is some joke. unbelievable that people actually purchase this crap.
0	It worked well  Sound realistic. Disappointed it only repeated once.
0	Disappointing.  With so much collaboration, I thought there would be better music.  I really only like the 21 Pilots song.
0	I've never really thought that Christina Aguilera has ever been able to generate any decent albums, despite being very vocally talented, her albums always seem to come out bloated and filler-laden. Even "Stripped" was a mess in many ways, despite producing some very outstanding pop music. It certainly doesn't help that she often seems overly confident in her musical output and songwriting either. Her 2010 effort, "Bionic" failed to garner much interest or critical acclaim, and didn't have any noticeable hits or hints of quality or respectable pop music. "Lotus" may even be worse, if that's even plausible. It begins with another useless intro, and throughout contains awkward collaborations ("Make the World Move" and "Just a Fool"), and not to mention, trite and useless ballads ("Sing for Me" and "Blank Page). The album does have some redeeming qualities, there are quite a few catchy tunes on it, but then you start to realize that many of them are quite generic and run-of-the-mill, and ultimately exhausting ("Let There Be Love," "Cease Fire," and "Around the World"). Other gripes I have with this album are the ridiculous and gaudy album cover, and the lack of great deluxe edition bonus tracks; I at least thought that "Bionic" had fantastic bonus material, "Lotus" just adds some B-quality dirge tacked on for a charge of a few extra measly dollars. It's not a surprise other popstars have and continue to outperform Aguilera in sales and quality musical output; talent does not necessarily equal great music. Bottom line, this album just isn't all too thrilling or outstanding, there are quite a few earworms throughout, but nothing that really makes you go "Wow!" or "This is timeless material that I'll treasure and that will entertain me for a lifetime." It's not at all shocking that Aguilera is continuing to suffer from low sales, and I seriously doubt she'll be able to dig herself out of this musical rut and lack of success, because her musical content was never all that strong to begin with.  Standout Tracks: "Army of Me," "Red Hot Kinda Love," "Your Body," and "Circles."
0	Totally worthless.  I could not open download.  Complete waste of money.
0	This isn't the version you are used to. It's a lame version. My 9 year old son loves the original version from the video, and I bought this without listening to it. A waste of a dollar, and my son is kind of sad about it.
0	How could anyone be expected tp buy this CD without a track listing?
0	I can't get my purchase into my iTunes library. Frustrated.
0	Thought it was just guitar music -  but it has ocean waves and talking - which is not what I expected (or wanted).
0	Looked for a long time for some of Jim Glaser's old songs and found this.  Unfortunately this version cuts off about a minute of the original version from Jim's album.  Disappointing!
0	Buy Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen instead.  This recording does not include the jam section many recognize from the radio.  Buy this version instead.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Black-Magic-Woman-Gypsy-Queen-Album-Version/dp/B00136QB1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen (Album Version)</a>
0	i cant watch it because of the different reagion thing on the blue ray players
0	just your typical selena gomez song. Like the energy though. I do not regret buying it. It is not that bad
0	I loved the first album. It was a pastiche of new and old sounds, rearranged with care into a beautiful and melodic otherness. This album feels more a tone poem, a Brian Eno style set of soundscapes, than the last album. Some of these soundscapes are quite evocative and beautiful, but feel more like an endless descent into another world with the driver asleep at the wheel than coherent musical ideas. Hunger of the Pine, the single, seems masturbatory and contrived, with all the bad influences of psychedelic drugs and none of the good ones. I can't imagine what its like to receive the plaudits these guys have, and they deserve them. They're excellent musicians and highly creative souls. But with success comes the consciousness of an audience, and then an attempt to play to and please that audience. This destroys many artists (see David Bowie after he put out "Let's Dance"), who either lose themselves in their own ego fortresses or spend their time trying to please all and end up pleasing none. If you enjoy long, saccharine sweet trips into nowhere, then this is for you.  Buy the album and see for yourself.
0	This is an Ok album in Incognito discography though not their best. Why do I rate it at 2-stars if it is an Ok music? Because I tend to beleive that we should not only listen to music but also try to understand it. Poor sound engineering can hardly allow to enjoy the spectrum of small bits of sound that add greatly to overall impression and invlovment. And the sound quality of this CD is awfull not to say more. It is flat, with no details and lacking life. It is not first time I noticed that Incognito releases are not mastered very well while their great music is all about soul and detail.  So, good music, bad sound.
0	Received a warped vinyl! Won't play-
0	Playing is really good, overall sound and production is same as everything since Youthanasia which makes this just blend with most metal albums these days. Chris Adler on drums is awesome but they seemed to kill his sound too, fills are signature though.
0	I love this artist. Smooth sounds, makes you enjoy music.  This song was downloaded to my phone . It still sounds very nice.
0	This Album seemed rushed, Lacked substance and showed little growth as a artist in my opinion. To me it was very boring and a lot of songs sounded the same. Waiting for another Phenomenal Album like her very first. Disappointed.
0	All these songs sound the same. The only good songs are "Fire" and "I Wouldn't Change a Thing." Sorry, I'm not trying to be rude. Oh and in case you're not aware I'm not David Archuleta. I'm just a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge fan:D
0	I did not especially care for the music, but it was very appropriate for our occasion, a family reunion.  I purchased this song for another that really likes it.
0	Chordiac Arrest was a great experience in person. They were hilarious, and sang well. Unfortunately, little of this recording captures that live experience. There are funny bits that do come across, but others are hard to hear because the audio levels are inconsistent. And at times the audience is laughing uproariously at the action onstage while the listener doesn't have a clue what's going on. You're better off getting the DVD or checking them out on YouTube
0	Bad. can I get my money back please?
0	Please give credit to the ACTUAL songwriter for this song.  This song (word and melody) was written and recorded by the songwriter Gordon Lightfoot in 1967 a year BEFORE Sarah McLachlan was even born.  From everything I've seen online there has been no proper credit given to the person that actually did the work of creating this song to begin with and that is just wrong!  I have lost any and all respect for this artist because of this blatant theft of another artist's work
0	Far too cloying. The original Fleetwood Mac version was sweet without being cloying and is far, far superior. Unfortunately, that version is not available as a legal MP3 download. I'm left with the option of buying the CD of Bare Trees for this song.
0	Not since CANIBUS' first release "CAN-I-BUS" have I been as disappointed in a long awaited release by a emcee(s) that I felt was DOPE. Been a fan of JOE BUDDEN since the DEF JAM/DJ CLUE days, a fan of JOELL ORTIZ since the "BRICK BODEGA CHRONICLES", like various songs by ROYCE and CROOKED. Been a fan of the various mixtapes they released as a group and their first two releases as SLAUGHTERHOUSE. But when someone releases a FREE mixtape "ON THE HOUSE" a week before the OFFICAL release, and the FREE MIXTAPE IS BETTER THAN THE ALBUM THAT YOU PAID FOR. THERE'S A PROBLEM. LYRICALLY, the album is on point, some of the subject matter isn't to my liking but can't deny the lyricism. The HOOKS and MUSIC however?  I'm sorry. but it's TERRIBLE! Almost EVERY SONG has singing on the hook. I don't want to hear SKYLAR GREY again for a while. it seems as if SHADY RECORDS gave them the formula that EMINEM used on his last couple of albums when it came to RADIO FRIENDLY songs. THIS is NOT the SLAUGHTERHOUSE that fans since 2008 have come to love. "HAMMER DANCE" gave me some hope as a single that they could release a song for radio that's dope. but it seems like it was hardly out before they went and put out "MY LIFE" w/CEE-LO  This song sounds like it should be playing in the background on some MTV reality show or ESPN during FIRST TAKE. and the rest of the album is the same formula with the exception of about 3-4 songs. Im shocked and hurt more than anything because I purchased the DELUXE edition of "WELCOME TO OUR HOUSE" but it seems as if the house is condemned.
0	This is simply 1.5min tracks thrown onto s disc. More could have been done. It's under developed and simply lazy for such a great band. If it's a nod to Richard why was it not exalted up and grandly injected with more flesh on the bones to honour him? Without Roger this band leaves itself appearing as lost and rudderless. I am such a big fan of all their earlier stuff and it's calibre for greatness. This appears a mish mash for the masses. I can't and won't listen to it again. 7 attempts is more than enough. No theme and soulless. I like the album cover.
0	you cannot transfer this to your ipod. you find that out after you purchase it. they want you to buy it. but they don't want you to listen to it.
0	great and unusual classical recording. it makes one think while it is playing.  an unusual  classical rendition and scoring .
0	This CD was disappointing.  Most of the partners were overshadowed by Barbra's powerful voice. The attempt to update the vocals fell short.
0	I've been a skillet fan ever since I first heard Comatose and was immediately addicted. I'm a Christian as well so the songs really stuck with me. Whether it was John's voice or Jen's great percussion, their songs had such great meaning and most of all, they were creative and fun to listen to. Skip to the release of Rise. I really enjoyed that album for the most part, but I felt like maybe it was a step back musically. Skip to when I first heard Invincible. I wanted to like it but. I could not. I was so afraid that they had really gone to mainstream and generic sounding music. So to my horror. I was correct. Unleashed is Skillet's worst album. Everything is so mainstream and generic sounding. Every song has almost house music in it? What?!?! Skillet using electronica?! Plus the lyrics are so. medicore at best. What happened to them? This is what selling out sounds like. Remember RED's album Release the Panic and how they got rid of their unique sound? Well that's this album. Wow. this is really depressing. The only song that kept me interested was Back From The Dead. It's probably the best song on the album. Anyway, I really REALLY hope Skillet returns to their core music and ditches this electronic sound as fast as possible.
0	I've been looking for the correct version of "Who Knows Where The Time Goes" so that I can have it on a CD.  Every version I've come across is one that I've never heard before.  This track sounds like they took the first half (the original version) and sloppily spliced in a different track that sounds horrible and completely unlike the original - different time, twangy, country-western-like.  I know for a fact that this is NOT the original track that's on the Colors Of The Day album, because I HAVE the album.  So, I paid for a download that was not as advertised. I read in some other place on the internet that the original version of "Who Knows Where The Time Goes" was only on a 45 record Side B that had "Both Sides Now" on Side A. That is incorrect.
0	Did not load in its entirety and for whatever reason it won't let me load it again. Not quite sure what the problem is.
0	so extremely disappointed!  I didn't realize that we wouldn't receive the mp3 version as well - as that is how it is listed on the initial "The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973-1984" Bruce Springsteen.
0	Never downloaded must be in a damp cloud somewhere was meant for my computer never found a thing in my search maybe on smartphone never any notification? Amazon.com new download procedure is really bad compared to going into their Downloader now u never even see any sign it went there so I can't evaluate album
0	Have know idea what this sounds like. Doesn't work @ all. Will update if changes occur.
0	I'm new to Los Lonely Boys, so my ears were virgin to their rock/latin fusion sound.  I immediately was drawn to their unique combination of english and spanish lyrics.  Their instrumentation is very tight and their rhythms and melodies give you the feeling of early Sublime.  The only reason I can't keep listening to the album is a few of the songs have really platitudinous lyrics.  I could have written this stuff in 9th grade.  If i were them, I would have focused more on the non vocal elements of the music which are really quite good.
0	The album is great. It grows on you, like most CD's that one gives the chance to. The only thing that I have to say against the album is that the CD artwork totally ruins the experience for the few minutes. It's as if no effort went into the CD artwork. I buy physical CD's for the experience; to get to know the project on a more personal level. This was a project I gave the chance to- to get to know. However, a simple jewel case with a solid black background for everything except the cover and no art at all except on the cover makes me feel like I got ripped off. I mean, I've never seen anything like this: it's a cover, and the name of the artist, album, and song orders repeated three times. -_-  DON'T GET THIS. Get the MP3 download for sure, or maybe what looks like a digipak at his Shopbenchmark page. DEFINITELY do not get this.
0	Yuck.  It's a re-recorded CD of music that's for some reason not available in digital.  Buy the CD "Candi Staton" and not this awful CD "Candi Staton - The Album."  Different things, though similar names.  The first one is great, and the latter is awful.
0	Perhaps it was just me but this album wasn't nearly as good as their first which was very good. I will listen to it again and see if I like it more.
0	Even "Supposed Former." had more of an edge on it than this. Gone is the rage. Gone is the energy.  Gone is my interest. Only the title track even comes close, and that's a distant close, to Jagged-Little-Pill-worthy. Alanis seems to have reinvented herself as cut-rate Enya. Alanis, if you're out there, go out, have a bad relationship, start a bar fight with Ani Difranco - get [mad]. The brilliant woman who gave us Jagged Little Pill is in there. Let her out!
0	I was disappointed in his renditions of the songs.
0	Unfortunately, I did not sample this before ordering. It is not the Benny Goodman Orchestra or anything sounding like a modern incarnation of Benny Goodman. I don't even know who the performing artists are and they are not part of the description. Avoid this album.
0	Don't bother with this. I'm sure Mike would rather it be buried. get the much superior "Greatest Hits Remixed" or "Light at the End of the World" if you don't already have it.!<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Greatest-Hits-Remixed/dp/B000S96ESK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Greatest Hits Remixed</a>
0	no inner sleeve on album, needed a fair amount of cleaning!
0	The vocals are terrible. sorry, but DLR has morphed into a terribly bad singer. for that reason, I would not recommend purchasing this album. VH should consider getting a trully professional singer who can make magic with their great catalog of songs. as a side note, Eddie sounds GREAT!
0	I had heard some negative things said about this soundtrack and believed untrue and bought the CD without any previous hearing. Very sadly I was mistaken. I am a fan of both Sparks and Houston but there is nothing absolutely nothing standout about this soundtrack. The songs are not engaging or memorable in the least. I know that might sound like I'm hating as some are just negative for negative sake but honestly I was expecting to love it. I also was a fan of Houston's last CD though many were not . with the heart wrenching I Look To You song. But I hate and truly hate to say that Houston's vocal majesty has even drastically changed from that last album. Which is purely sad and it makes me even more sad because this was her last recording.  I was expecting the songs to have a show stopping element or even a classic Motown feel. It does not. I am just surprised that considering the immense talent behind this product that the song choices were not stellar. I am truly disappointed and feel that I should have saved my money. Hopefully the film is better,  but what is a good musical with bad songs? My Mother who loves Sparks from American Idol and Houston,  who we both had seen her predominantly live,  thought this CD was a dud. I am still a fan of Houston and I will always love you Whitney.  Just a follow up review, just recently listened to I look to You CD, with some friends and everyone who had listened to Sparkle cd, even commented that by this time, meaning the recording of Sparkle, Houston had completely lost her voice, and for a fan, like myself that is heartbreaking. Buy one of Houston's early recordings, and enjoy some more stellar songs and an amazing voice. That is what music is supposed to sound like.
0	Horrible! Plastic and very very child like.
0	Was supposed to be a clean CD. Was anything but clean. Had a sticker that said it was clean. Also had parental advisory on it.
0	I am absolutely in love with this book, but I thought I'd save money and not purchase the album. However, last night (on day 17), I decided that I would really enjoy a guided meditation for the Spark of Light meditation. So, without hesitation, I bought it here on Amazon. Then I had to download the Amazon Mp3 app, install it and wait for the mp3's to download. It was a process needless to say, haha. Anyways, imagine my disappointment when the meditation wasn't even on there! Then I went to her website where the cd is almost $15 and it doesn't even list what's on there. Then I went on iTunes and read the 2 comments that say there's 4 meditations missing :( Then I went on her FB and asked her where it was. I know she's a busy and successful women, but she did not respond yet and she's been posting on her page (or her publicist is).  I am not so naive as to think that Gabreille is controlling every detail of her book and album promotion, BUT how did this slip through the cracks? I'm almost sad now because it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth about the intention behind this album.  I really hope that they do some guest recovery on this.  *update ~ Gabrielle has yet to address any of the concerns that have been posted on her FB by me and other people. She answers all the positive comments that people post and totally ignores or deletes comments in reference the the missing meditations. It's so rude.
0	Ok now this album is one of my favourites and after finally getting a new turntable this was the first new album I bought. I had seen there were some complaints about the quality of the vinyl but I crossed my fingers and hoped.  Well I didn't cross them hard enough. The set was still shrink wrapped and arrived without any delivery damage I could see but all 6 sides have marks and track 2 on side 3 is so scratched it looks unplayable (Haven't got it home yet). Time will tell how damaged the complete set is. Very disappointing. Also the sleeves are all torn on the sides where the records have moved within them. Not a real problem but.  Now having bagged the production values of Apple/EMI or whoever pressed them I couldn't be happier with Amazon. I had sent in a complaint within 10 minutes of opening the box and had the whole thing sorted within 30 minutes.  As unhappy as I am with the vinyl I couldn't be happier with Amazon and their staff.
0	I'm a fan of soul and neo-soul. I can even appreciate- of all people- Macy Gray. This girl right here I just don't get. I mean, there isn't one song on this album I like. I have Erika's new album, it's good. I have Kem's new album, it's good. This. well all I can say is: Buy it if you're into tone deaf singers.
0	When I listen to this album, and then listen to their debut songs like "No Giving Up", "Starless", "Cold" "Death Trend Setta" I just cannot embrace this album at all.  No, I personally don't believe its because the band lost a member.  I think Crossfade is obviously one of those bands who without a record label breathing down their necks, makes this great debut album when just getting signed before they come in and tell them what to do.  However, Crossfade to be is one of those bands who after getting popular and making some money, becomes lazy and puts this pitiful effort into their follow-up album. There is just something missing in this album, and I don't think I can think of the words to describe it but this album just isn't as catchy as the first one.  "Falling Away", what an appropriate title for this album because if they keep this up, they will be "falling away."
0	the only reason it got 2 stars was because it says I but i got it to give to someone else and they only said thanks
0	He's absolutely stopped trying. The most forgettable single yet. He's now just an oldies act putting out occasional single to feel relevant.
0	This is a no no. I got the wrong one. Maybe they need to try again and that may work.
0	alot of stolen jokes here . made me mad
0	I gave 2 stars out of respect to an excellent band. Has prosperity gotten to them? Hope their next one is better than this .
0	Hip Hop is the art of creative reinvention. This song is plain stealing from Bingo Players,  the artists of the original song. Compare both, and see for yourself.  When you remix a song, you but ' remix' at the end of it. It's admitting that you don't own the song, you just made some changes to it-usually dramatic changes that turn it almost into another song. Flo Rida's attempt at remixing was zero effort, the making of the song couldn't have taken more than a month (once again, compare the song to the original and you'll see what I mean). Their is only one part that is actually remixed, otherwise the pitch and every component of the song remains untouched.  Other artists have done this before, but not to this length of extreme laziness and stealing. Harder Better Faster Stronger had a top40 remix that actually changed the song from French house to 2000's hip Hop. That's great and totally acceptable, as the song was totally revamped in a creative way. Ice Cube's Check yo self rips the beat directly from grand master flash's ' the message', much like Flo Rida, but unlike Flo Rida, Ice Cube's tight handle on rapping turns it into a new song: the rapping lasts the whole song, the rapping is more than one repeated chorus unlike Flo Rida's pathetic attempt, and Ice Cube does not rely on autotune to carry his song.  I realize this is something silly to be upset about, but as a DJ, Bingo Player's ' Cry just a Little' was formative to my career, and it's upsetting to see it go unaccredited when it hit top40, and for Flo Rida to change practically nothing about the song then call it his.  As consumers we have a responsibility to purchase products that we find high quality and original, so then the industry will make high quality and original products. If we buy this song, we are saying that it is okay to rip off a small Dutch band's hit, put one layer of track over it, and then call it our own. Your dollar is your voice, spend it wisely.
0	If Rob put 10% of his efforts on his horror films into his music. it would only then be decent. Rob is starting to sound like a crappy version of PRIMUS. Make movies Rob, not music!
0	great overview of Sweat's career, including the LSG gem "my body". the songs can't overcome the brickwalled mastering, listen to this if you want to induce a headache in 20 minutes time.
0	DJ Khaled is terrible, and can't even eat hot wings. Drake cries all the time. Pass.
0	Maybe if you're a musician. or if you just like weird, experimental, totally non-commercial music, you will like this.  I loved "Graceland" and so many other things that Simon has done, but so much of this new album just sounds like practice sessions or studio outtakes!  In some instances the musicians sounded out of synch to me; maybe that's part of being "edgy" and avant-garde these days.  There were maybe two songs that were bearable, but not particularly memorable.  The rest were downright wretched and I could hardly bear to listen to them all the way through.  It's the usual case of the critics loving something merely because it's "difficult."
0	A couple of great tracks but otherwise too kitsch.
0	just a bunch of crappy  noisy. It is not recommended at all. Don't buy it. Does not worth the money.
0	This is the worst piece of vinyl I've ever purchased, making it really hard to know how to rate this since I love the album. I ended on a 1-star so hopefully anyone reading this will stick to digital/cd.  Vinyl is extremely thin, and so light I have to use a weight to keep it from slipping on a felt mat. The vinyl was slightly warped, and the hole for the spindle on both records had so much flashing that I had to use a knife to cut out the excess vinyl just so it could fit on the spindle. This is literally the worst quality record I own, and that's including old garage sale vinyl that was siting in the sun priced at 5 bucks for a crate.
0	Hide your wallets so you can make her go away. gosh this is so replusive. not even worth 1 star. Not worth the hype folks move along.
0	I'm a huge Dylan fan but listening him sing Sinatra songs is painful. I give him points for trying but really he is not a crooner.
0	Listen, I'm a huge dead prez fan, but this album is weak.  the beats are boring and repetitive and rhyme schemes are simplistic and the subject matter has been done 13 years ago on lets get free and RBG.  I was hoping for more from M1 and the Stic.  I personally would rather remember them for their first two albums than this.  Its not trash, but its not good either.  Do what I wish I did and Preview the songs and you'll see what I mean.
0	i really don't appreciate amazon not allowing us to use our reward dollars available on our credit cards when we buy MP3s. i don't accrue that many reward credits on my credit cards, it would be much more fair if we could use those towards MP3 purchases.
0	None of these songs, except "Swayin' to the Music (Slow Dancin') are the original radio versions. They are re-records. Buyer Beware!
0	What's this? A speed reading contest? Moreover, sentences got cut at the end of each track.
0	very disappointed in her music and voice
0	I can't even be kind on this review.  with the exception of "only you" and "Whatever Lola Wants" quite frankly Lola wants never to  have bought this pathetic CD.  To say it is boring (there must be a better word than boring) but at the moment I can't come up with one.  There is so little orchestra music out there that is worth listening too anymore and Pourcel is one of the better ones.  However, this CD misses the mark in every selection in every direction.  To say that it's elevator music would cause the person in the elevator to go to sleep and forget to get off.  This is my last effort with Franck Pourcel, I think I've had quite enough of his sleepy time music.
0	It wasn't what I was expecting. Didn't care for it.
0	Not the sequel she promised as part of a trio of annual Christmas.
0	Would have received more stars but I could not download it directly to my phone. I don't want multiple music apps on my device. One location for music period.
0	a BAD!BAD!BET! we have every elling out there. like/love most. you cant really beat the "this time its love" CD. but this one sounds made for a buffet-over-eating, non-musical vegas' audiance. BAD! went to see/hear elling at his recent NYC Brill Building concert. what goes on in vegas should STAY there. save your chips. and yes our name is BRILL.
0	This song is a blatant ripoff of U2's "With or Without You." If you don't believe me, then listen to them back to back.
0	Some remixes shouldn't be made. That is all
0	Best is nice words and singing are Crap
0	Why ruin art in this fashion? This entire album sucks now, because the entire album is basically brickwalled. Look up Loudness wars and you will understand. Watch this too. [.]
0	this was not the song i was wanting or pulled up , i feel like i was trick into buying it.
0	Terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer Leslie Rasmussen blames a rape victim
0	It sounds like she is singing through her nose. I want my .99 cents back!
0	After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So. with Amazon, always read the fine print.
0	As a Guy listening to this is a bit like cats scratching your face. Listen to my sage advice: Boyfriends and girlfriends just need common sense and communication, but this song is for those "Mangina's" who hate themselves, and guys who never are able to disagree with their leader, the Gal in their life. AS far as the song, it's a better country cong, all country and oldtime music can wax a bit satirical and humorous.
0	gotta love beyonce she's still desirable regardless of the fact that she makes songs to her demon other self or ancient goddesses like ishtar, isis or any other deities she choose to simulate like metropolis go b do a remake of queen of the damned why don't do tell em who you really serve along with rihanna.
0	These are not the original versions of these classic songs.  A later edition of Rare Earth rerecorded these songs for this collection.  Not bad, but the originals are much better.
0	I have been looking for a good oldies instrumental cd for some time. When I saw this one and looked at the songs on it, bingo it was the one. This one had just about everything I had wanted! So, I ordered it. When I received it I played it right away. Something didn't sound right. These instrumentals are by various artists, not the originals. I have to admit that I did not notice this when ordering. Instead of returning I gave the cd to Goodwill!
0	There isn't a word in the English language to describe just how absolutely terrible this album is.  I don't know which is funnier - this so-called attempt at music, or the artist's shameless self-promotion on this website by obviously having friends post "good" reviews of it.
0	This is my second Philip Glass album.  I honestly tried to stick with it. It's like listening to a washing machine hoping that the dryer will contribute something interesting.
0	This is a waste of money. only one track and it is a crappy remix of a great song. I thought it was the actual cd "Decades" because from the mp3 version of the actual cd amazon directed me to this album.  Does anyone know how to give less than one star?  James Egbert should go to bed every night knowing that he is a douche just like i do for buying this cd.
0	I think Lady Gaga will probably do best when seen live . she's fun to watch.  But her music, like this song, is just rehashed dance/techno/mixing-board stuff.  You've heard it a million times.  And it's not exactly a new technique to put suggestive lyrics on top of a Christmas song.  Rate this one "Z" for "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz .".
0	Buyer beware.  These are all re-recorded versions of their classic hits, but this time recorded with the current line-ups.  Not live - just re-recordings.  Unnecessary re-recordings.  C'mon guys.
0	I thought this product was the Thank you CD which has several songs.  But instead it was a sound track for the song Thank You.
0	This cd is a bootleg CD-R recording made from the vinyl lp's. How much more money do The Osmonds need to lose to pirates, before Curb gets off their butts and releases The Osmonds back catalog on cd? H-E-L-L-O.$ being lost here. fans waiting here. WAKE UP CURB.
0	Unable to download to my device. Purchased it 5 times and still didn't download. Music app is HORRIBLE.
0	I ordered AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW  and received something else. There was a issue that is being looked into.
0	Very little instrument use. Cappella is good but not for all songs. Some voices were stronger than others. Adding verses to old songs like How great Thou Art is a good way to destroy a good song. Wasn't impressed at all.
0	Drake has a standard style to all his songs.  It usually involves him trying to be soft-spoken ladies man trying to woo his next conquest.  He often incorporates an atypical music component and, sometimes, has a featured female singer.  "One Dance" has all those 'Drake-ian' elements to it and the result is uninspiring.  The heavy-duty Drake fans won't listen to such blasphemy (after all, they did push it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100), but an objective analysis has to be honest.    Drake's chosen musical component is an odd, auto-tuned series of exotic horns that seem over-produced.  While this part is mediocre, the real shortcoming is featured singer, Kyla.  While Kyla appears to have been around for several years and has had some success in the industry, her contribution to "One Dance" is just bad.  Her 'verses' simply do not match the flow of the song.  They are slow and disjointed and she is also trying too hard to be sexy.
0	I have looked at two pages here side by side and I can't for the life of me figure out why this version of 'Help' put out by Toshiba EMI in 2004 is priced at $41.49, while what looks to be the exact same CD put out by Capitol in 1990 is priced at a much more reasonable $13.49.  Unless you can find something I am missing, I'd suggest you head over to  http:/ www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002UAL/ref=m_art_li_59/102-3455281-6122531?v=glance&s=music  and buy that one.
0	I haven't been able to listen to this song. Even though I paid for it, your pathetically worthless cloud player won't allow me to download it to my laptop or my Android. So ya know what? I don't need you people Amazon is not the only place to buy music, so if you bunch of overpaid morons are too stupid to get your cloud system to work right then you obviously no longer need me as a customer.
0	Like this old one hit wonder, but didn't realize I wasn't really getting the song, I can only listen to it tru amazon cloud music service; LAME
0	Not the version I've heard on the radio.
0	Dull as dishwater.  What is wrong with so much of Christian music these days, no melody hooks to draw you in and lyrics written by a five year old.
0	I am sure he has other good CDs, but I haven't found it yet.
0	I love Michael's work generally, but this recording was not what I expected.  He says different feeling words, and we're to sense them in our bodies.  He only goes through HALF of them (in alphabetical order)- the other half is on the second recording.  As a result, I left the experience feeling incomplete. Plus, I'd rather not bring words like "crushed" and "agitated" into my consciousness just for the heck of it.  I'll bring them in to clear whatever experience.  Still, it didn't click at all with my being more expressive.  This one's a miss for me.
0	Only 183 kbps file?  Very disappointing, Amazon. And I don't want your installer program, and I don't want the file automatically imported into iTunes. If you want me to buy more music from you, Amazon, I want a 320 kbps that I can download to where I choose. Also disappointed that the file size is not known until AFTER the purchase. Bad form. If you are going to sell low quality files, offer them at half price. Be transparent about what you are offering, and let the consumer decide where the file is stored.
0	this is overproduced garbage. i cannot even tell if i'm listening to iggy, katy perry, or rihanna anymore. all this stuff sounds the same, overproduced and generic
0	I loved the first 2 albums by these guys, and while some reviewers might call this record more "mature", it is a departure and less inspired. The best songs on the album are the ones that sound like they belong on the first two albums; frenetic, interesting, and evocative of 8-bit adventures that never were. It seems to me these guys are running out of ideas and their music is becoming dependent on current club track production trends. This awful change is being disguised as an "evolution" for the quartet. Lots of side-chaining and 4/4 beefy kick drums. Gone are the ever-present chip basslines in favor of cleaner and much more common higher quality fat basses. Once I heard the vocals on the second track the image on the cover made sense to me. They've departed from the mile-a-minute cartridge game rollercoaster style of music to give us what sounds like an awful amateur-sung anime intro meets teletubby backpack wearing candy raver drivel. The only thing keeping this record from being a complete name-besmirching piece of trash are the few songs that harken back to their earlier style, though none of them demonstrating the freshness of the tracks on the Scott Pilgrim VG OST. These tracks show they still have it, somewhat. I am astounded by the amount of 5 star ratings and glowing reviews coming from people who must've heard their earlier works, none of whom appear disappointed in the least.
0	Crappy music, stuff like this should't be on Amazon
0	Awful - sounds like he's croaking though the broken end of a Coke bottle! Why did he do it, he must be worth a billion bucks by now? Guess there are limits to genius after all.
0	21 Pilots is by far the worst band i have ever had the displeasure to listen to. The Singer cant sing, the writer cant write, and i feel like stabbing out my eardrums every tim i hear this come on the radio. Please, Dont encourage them. invest in quality, not quantity.
0	you have to buy this 2 cd set, there is only 1 other song on this 2 cd set that is good, but its an old song on another release. looks like i will have to hear si te perderias on youtube. but what a song! wow! but i'll skip buying a  2 cd just for 1 song. me  entiende?
0	I downloded this song to listen to new music, but it is not my preference. It is a very experimental music for my preference.
0	No, I wanted to download one song, not buy two albums
0	I have a sonos system for playing music and I have had problems using it on that system.  Apparently purchases of music on download are limited to the computer it is downloaded to. I want to transfer that to my cel phone and cannot. I love the song
0	I'm a huge fan of Stephen Marley, but to  call this part II of Revelation is an insult to part I. This album is much more poppy with songs that were obviously created to cross over into other markets and be played in nightclubs. I usually end up skipping over most of the songs when they come up on my playlist.
0	This is the most horrible thing I have ever heard. I hope that future prospective buyers read these reviews first and decide not to! My worst impulse buy ever - that will teach me, LOL!
0	Disappointing. I didn't find many songs that I like listening to on this album.
0	Chrisette Michelle is a very talented singer! I thoroughly enjoyed her 1st Album, jammed to the 2nd Album, and this one not so much. I'm having a hard time just trying to enjoy it. Let Freedom Reign is not her best work. Almost every song sounds alike. I've seen her in concert and can testify that she has a true talent and gift; however, I'm just not moved by this album. Which I think every person expects when listening to an artist; to be moved, changed, or just to vibe. I'M NOT FEELING IT! But I will continue to support her as an artist and peacefully respect her right to express herself (even though I am not feeling this album).
0	"Golden Voices Sing Golden Favorites" is my least favorite of so many enjoyable Reader's Digest CD compilations.  The singers will sound strident and unattractive to those who have not grown up listening to classically trained voices singing "semi-classical" music.  Mario Lanza sounds lovely, But most of the "great voices", for one reason or another, sound out of their element: Pavarotti, Leontyne Price, Migenes, Milnes, Eileen Farrell, Domingo, Sills, Te Kanawa, Battle, Moffo, et al. Perhaps, this "digitally remastered" CD needs more current remastering?
0	Streisand has already recorded the majority of these songs (some of them enduring standards she has performed to death!) featured here which are also included on her studio and live albums.  While it is mildly interesting to hear songs such as 'evergreen', 'people' and 'the way we were' sung as duets, did we really need to hear them again even though altered and reinterpreted? let's face it. all these remakes of songs sound inferior to their original versions. In my opinion it would have been far more thrilling to hear Streisand perform material she has never sung before. All of Streisand's partners on this album (except for her son) have extensive and fantastic work they have produced during their careers why didn't she choose to perform their songs instead or totally new material especially written for this album? Yes she does sing Billy Joel's `New York State of Mind' with him yet she has already covered this song which is included on one of her albums!  While there is much to say about the varying quality of interpretation of each song, I am not too sure about the awfull beyond-the-grave duet with Elvis (these virtual duets where already cheesy back in the 90's can we now just move on!); instead a duet with someone else such as George Michael for instance (amongst many others) would have been far more welcome. I am not too keen on `What kind of fool' either (the second biggest dud here!), already a fantastic classic duet unnecessarily remade here. The new arrangements don't feel right (it was originally produced as a pop song with a tempo and works better that way) and while I have great respect for John Legend, he can't compare to Barry Gibbs! And there is also something rather odd with `How deep is the ocean' being sung between mother and son or is it just me?. On the positive side, the duet with Bocelli is awesome!  I hear rumours of a duet album featuring only females which is already in progress, if so, I hope it will be better than this. Take notes Barbra!  Overall: an ok easy listening album that will appeal to most and will call for the `wow factor' only because of the famous names associated to it, Andrea Bocelli and Stevie Wonder being the highlights,(reminds me of these bad movies starring major A list actors everyone goes and see) but also a sadly missed opportunity in many ways!
0	This was really lousy. It felt like a soft core porno rather than a motivating workout session. Don't do it.
0	It is impossible to rate this as the 1st CD was split in 1/2 when it was opened by my daughter as a Christmas gift.  I will report this to customer service.
0	It says explicit but it is clearly censored in some parts. It actually has very little differences from the clean version.
0	Not what I was expecting, not a good recording.
0	Poor - very poor. I want my money back!
0	Right CD label, wrong songs were burned to the disk second time ordering the classics volume 1 from two steps from hell.
0	It made me cringe.  This is a beautiful piece not played to its true potential.  Reordered the same song played by Isaac Stern. much better.
0	Those aren't crickets.  They're tree frogs.  I happen to like frogs, but their call isn't quite as relaxing as what I was expecting.
0	Wow, this is bad. What's up with the fingers scraping on the guitar strings? Makes me wonder how did this chick got any record deal, even an indie. Thanks, Amazon, but no thanks.
0	I am an old-guard Matisyahu lover. His voice, his lyrical mastery, and the pure soul he imbibes into his work is what has made me a loyal follower since the beginning.  This album completely lacks that beautiful spiritual vibe that made him famous, and instead it relies on heavy production gimmicks that overpower his singing. While it's not all that different from his other albums (aside from the tongue-in-cheek Tel Aviv'n, which, honestly, when my husband and I heard it start, made us gag, the background beat is just far too distracting from his own work.  To put this in context, I do like Top 40 and dance mixes, so I wondered if I was just shocked by Mati's new sound or if it really was that bad. We found a Lady Gaga song, played it, and yup, the production is really that bad. I feel like he's gone backward in so many ways and I'm honestly sad that he feels this album reflects his work in a freer sense - perhaps being a poster child for Hassidism kept him reigned in, and while I support whatever changes he makes ideologically as a person, don't let "freedom" equate with "giving everything a try" in the name of it.  I was so glad this album only cost me five bucks. I have listened to it twice, trying to learn to enjoy it, and I won't.
0	So disappointed by this CD.  Alex & Sierra - this was horrible. Stay true to yourselves.  What the heck was that Euroclub track all about?  This was a crazy jumble of styles.  Almost none of the Alex & Sierra we loved on the show.
0	Yeah, no. I only sampled the songs and now I'm glad I didn't purchase it when I was trying to find it in stores to purchase it. The hell happened to all the great music that was on the Divergent OST? I usually am a fan of movie soundtracks, but unfortunately, I will not be adding this one to the collection.
0	was not enjoyable sounded like a weekend basement DJ lust layered a piano tune over a fireplace sample. not relaxing at all.
0	This is a terrible CD.  Aweful music and completely misguided lyrics.  This CD makes me question the fate of our great country if people actually review this music as good.  If you even consider buying this CD, stop and rent the movie Farenhype 9/11.  The creators of this god-aweful CD and those who embrace it should stop now because your going to be pretty embarrased in the years to come.
0	Meghan Trainor is trying to cash in on the "empowerment" movement but actually listening to the music quickly shows the songs are full of misogynistic rhetoric better suited to the actual 1950's.  The songs are bubblegum cute but center on being attractive for men & what men prefer.  There's nothing of real substance here.
0	Its says clean, but it isn't. it is in no way edited. Know the song by heart and it in no way different from the original version because it is the original version  Purchased to play for my students as part of a lesson on the riots and luckily I listened to it before playing it. I have the unedited version on multiple CDs and didn't need to pay for the song. The label "Clean" is a false advertisement.  Great song and personally I prefer the unedited version but not when buying for my students.
0	Let me first say that I would love to like this CD.  The music is certainly fantastic.  But. this is one of the single worst recordings I have ever heard.  The engineer responsible for this atrocity should be drawn and quartered.  Though, perhaps that is a bit harsh; after all, I ought to give him or her the benefit of the doubt, because perhaps this misguided person was simply trying to hide the fantastically sub-par singing of the ensemble.  I'm not sure if they were going for an "authentic" sound, and don't quite get how the tuning system used in Monteverdi's time worked, but this CD abounds with moments that make nails on a blackboard sound positively angelic.  Which is unfortunate, because most of the ensemble does fairly well most of the time.  But we all know that a vocal ensemble is only as strong as its weakest member, and there seem to be a couple of singers among this group who consistently end a full 25 cents flat or sharp on key notes.  And I've decided not to give the engineer the benefit of the doubt, because the instruments actually seem decent, in the few moments when you can actually hear them.  Final verdict - unless you're some sort of auditory masochist, or you have some compulsive need to purchase every CD ever made of Monteverdi's music, avoid this.  Because there's nothing more offensive to a musical enthusiast than hearing beautiful music made to sound ugly.
0	This is a prime example of a band hanging around (like the Stones & Springsteen), because they can.  Put out an album & they think it will work.  NOT SO HERE.  I have seen these guys numerous times with the Beach Boys & a long time fan (CTA days).  This album has maybe 2 songs worth putting on my IPOD - Where Are You?  and Already Gone.  The rest you can put out to pasture.  Please, some weird stuff here - 90 Degrees and freezing & Come To Me, Do.  What the heck was Lamm thinking about.  Better yet, what was RHINO thinking about.  Time to hang up the horns boys.
0	Most of the music starts out okay but then in the middle it gets loud and takes on a jazzy type sound which doesn't do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep.  Of course the samples that are given don't let you know that.  Worst 1.99 I have spent.  May not seem like a lot to Amazon but for me it was like throwing it out the window.  Amazon can do that with it's own money.  I won't purchase another music from them.
0	Very poor quality. Both the cd and DVD are messed up.  The DVD skips and stops during play and the cd skips and sounds distorted. What a waste of money.
0	This version of the song I downloaded before I realized how it sounded, and it was different than the one I grew up loving.  The sound is more "tinny" than the other version I love, which can be found on an album called Popular Classics Vol. 2.  I subsequently downloaded the latter version which has a richer, more visceral production quality.
0	the music industry really sucks in the sense it really sucks. there is no reason mor me to listen to music it just sucks. rea
0	I got the cd days after purchasing it. Bravo for that! But it wouldn't play. I was excited about it arriving and am angry at this catastrophe.
0	is it april 1st?  I wish it was and on april 2nd the real taddy porter is coming out, are these the same guys?  and the recording style is akin to the 60s, I saw them twice in hollywood and they kicked ass,  this style i will have to avoid.  the bass player probably has a crew cut now,  whats the world coming too?
0	30 second sample did not give opportunity to determine if it was a instrumental or not. Its explicit, but the title doesnt tell you that nor does the sample.
0	If you love Stevie Nicks this may be for you.  Otherwise, I can hear that these are not her best tunes.  They apparently come from a time when she wanted all her music to sound the same.  Maybe I'm getting old, but these just do not reach me like many of her other songs did.  Sorry Stevie.
0	Yeah, it's ok. but just barely. As a band, they sound great. The production, musicianship, cohesion etc. is really top notch, a carry over effect from the far superior effort, "The Connection". Here Papa Roach is simply treading water. The lyrics are as empty and unforgivably bland. Jacoby Shaddix has absolutely nothing new or remotely interesting to say here. As soon as the songs end, it evaporates from memory. What a let down from the previous album.
0	Dull, boring i downloaded it when it first came out with the usual expectations. I haven't listened to a complete track yet.
0	This is  a third party seller,that is selling my brothers songs,1 at a time. Don't buy it! Amazon will be handled. I'm shocked amazon will not pull this item.
0	DID THIS GO TO MY KINDLE?  I LIKE DAVE BUT I DON'T NO HOW TO ACCESS IT.  LOVE TO LISTEN TO IT,  SAW HM IN '75.
0	This was bought for my mothers wedding when her DJ bailed last minute.  Paid for it twice and it didn't work.  Bust.  Wish I could give it one Star.
0	Adding my voice to the chorus. This is not the original theme song!
0	You know that feeling moment before you are about to vomit? Do you enjoy that sensation? Then this album is for you!
0	I think it should clearly state that this is a cover of the song. It is NOT Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram. In fact I could not find a version of the original that I was sure was the version with James Ingram and Linda Ronstadt.
0	I like upbeat positive music.  Katy had just divorced that nut ball, so all or most songs are about break up and waaaaahhhhhh me.  I don't like it.
0	While this song is fantastically epic, this particular version blowsssss. The first 30 seconds of the song is just applauding. LAAAAMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
0	Too much water sounds.  Its on every track. Dissapointed.
0	While I may not like Taylor Swift in entertainment news, her songs are still absolutely wonderful. More grown up on this CD!
0	The music is very uplifting and the lyrics are inspiring. I ordered this because my sons wife is going through some very stressful health issues and though they are being very hopeful I can still understand the fear they are feeling. Everytime I hear this song I think of them and how it can be an inspiration to them.
0	For more years than it should have taken me, I have been meaning to buy this album. All these years later it does not disappoint.
0	This talented newcomer offers a catchy tune with meaningful words, sung with heart.  I can't wait for his full debut album in 2013!
0	My son loves watching the DVD. He cracks up whenever the Okee Dokee Brothers are being silly, and then he listens and follows along with his own instruments when the brother starts singing songs. The CD is constantly playing in our car! We love the OkeeDokee Brothers!
0	I can not wait to hear some original songs from her. in some cases her singing is better than the original vocalist. I like to hear Jasmine do a vocaloid song. (thinks it would be amazing)
0	Amazing voice, exquisite expression, a must hear.  Find your sweet reality with the help of this exceptionally talented artist.
0	Though I don't understand a single word, except what I've read in the English translation of it, this has always been a favorite of mine. I remember riding around listening to Wolfman Jack on the radio, and the all request oldies show on Saturday nights, this song was almost always requested at some point! I loved it then, and love it now!  I was watching "Born In East L.A." and this song is played in the background within the first 5 minutes or so of the movie. I never did find a Soundtrack recording for Born In East L.A., so I don't know if this song is on it. But I am glad I found it here on Amazon to add to my all-time personal favorites!  Sadly, Kyu Sakamoto, the great singer of this song died in a plane crash at just 43 years old. He really did have a very smooth unique sounding voice.
0	It reminds me of how special my relationship is between my daughter and I.  Amazing, beautiful.
0	It's been quite a while since Roger Waters has done an album.  Any political leanings aside, I suppose this album might be one of the positive outcomes of the Trump administration so far.  Is this The Life We Really Want? is a very politicized album.  Completely missing are Waters' usual cryptic metaphors and symbolism.  This album is very blunt about what Waters' views are on the current state of affairs here on Earth.  I'm going to ignore this polarizing topic and note why I really love this album.  It sounds very much like it came out of the mid-70s Pink Floyd era.  There are glimmers of Animals, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and the Wall all wrapped up in these songs.  I have to say it is a welcome feeling although it's also a very dark, moody feeling album as well.  Oddly the feel of it also reminds me of David Bowie's Aladdin Sane album.  I think it's the sparse syncopated drumming.  Roger's voice is sounding a bit more frail when he's screaming in his typical fashion but it's also deeper adding to the moody darkness of these songs.  The album is produced by Nigel Godrich who normally likes the voice front and center on his work but Roger's seems a little quiet in the mix of all the music.  Still it's a somber but pleasing album at the same time, mostly for it's nostalgic Pink Floyd feel to it.
0	I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
0	For everone who needs to feel loved and held. This is a healing song. Be Blessed Natalie Grant is one of the greatest Gospel Artist around now!
0	Great vinyl! Great band! Side 2 seems to drag a bit but it may just be my record player, other than that love it!
0	the cd : il volo, was packaged very carefully. the music is awsome, and the singers voices are divine.  well, well done, worth 100% buing it thank you
0	Long time Waters fan here, I have almost every floyd and all of his solo material. I played a lot of the sample songs from this new cd before I bought it, and i was not too impressed. But when I heard it on my system all the way through, I liked it a lot better. And I can not remember the last time I sat through a whole cd. I'm sure with more plays it will grow on me. The only gripe I have is that I wish there were a little more lead guitars and more of his usual female background singers. I do not think that this CD is as good as Amused to death but I can't think of any CD that is. Amused to Death was Waters very best, done at the height of his creativity. After a couple of spins of this disk I have to say that Nigel Godrich did an excellent job at producing and mixing this recording. I like how some of the notes just seem to linger and slowly decay into the next note. Excellent recording
0	As the other reviewers have said, only a few are true Tangos but all are very Latin. That said, the thought that crossed my mind in listening to these songs was that if Enya or Medwynn Goodall did Latin instead of Celtic influenced music, this is what it would sound like. A kind of new age feel on the slower instrumental tracks, especially. That's not a put-down from my point of view. Would be great as a background to a quiet party, or candle lit dinner, to read to, or just to mellow out and veg. Two or three up-tempo tracks are dance-able. Excellent production quality. Well worth downloading.
0	All I can say about this album is. EXCELLENT!. Been waiting for this album since March, and let me tell you, they defiantly didn't disappoint.  Still not as good as their first album though. This album had great production, and good mixing by Eminem, and me saying this album is great is strange for me, cause I'm a strictly underground hip hop fan, but the lyrics on this album is why its soo great, they really brought their ammunition. they are four lyricist, and it should stay like that, no matter how big they get, or how mainstream they get. they kept it 100 all through this album.  It does sound at first listen as poppy, but thats not the case, just listen to their lyrics, how well they structured each song. That mixtape was hot too, doing 30+ bars, thats crazy. BEST MAINSTREAM RAPPERS OUT! SUPPORT REAL HIP HOP!
0	Perhaps the best album as he has had since Graceland. An album full of invention, melodic, innovative and entertaining. Great to see a new classic from Paul Simon. The more you listen to it, the better it becomes. Let it sink in like the complex piece that it is.
0	I heard Ryksopp first several years ago, and as a massive EDM fan I loved them right away for their unique take on the electronic music scene, with their much warmer and rounded rhythms and full-bodied tone. but this song somehow eluded me until recently.  And it's their best one ever.  I will put this on 1-track repeat and let it just go over and over.  The warm bass, that full symphony, the swankin' beats and just fantastic groove Ryksopp assembled for this song synergize to create something epic, like your own personal montage song for life.
0	Warm lush brilliant songs by a master not yet at the top of his game
0	LOVE THIS SONG TOO! JESUS YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF MY HEART AND EVERYTHING AROUND ME!
0	This cd is fun, every song on it is good, it is make you smile, laugh and just fell good.  great music for all.
0	I like the eclectic style of Jonathan.  I've listened to it every day for several days and it's not getting old.  Definitely worth the money spent on it.
0	R. Kelly is a musical genius but the 5 stars all I can give. this is definitely the jam to have.
0	For me, this album constitutes one of the best compilations of Callas' art, culling some of her best moments ever in the recording studio, bar none.
0	If you like this type of music this album is one of the best. And frankly I like this type of music.
0	A sountrack to very different moments. An interesting record, specially Ghosts III and IV. Very good, but the instrumentals from The Fragile are way better.
0	David Byrne has always been an important musical thinker as far as I'm concerned anyway. Always very strongly attuned to rhythms he was one of the few people of his era able to see the possibilities in the African concept of polyrhythms in music and finding new ways to expand on that. He not only did that as a founding member of Talking Heads but also through a couple decades of creatively groundbreaking solo recordings. Now there are a number of artists taking up his league such as Annie Clarke,better known as St. Vincent,who is in her way seeking to expand on the perceived foundations of "pop" music. So the two combined in 2010 to begin recording this project that would not only combine her songwriting with his rhythmic sensibilities,but also add to that an enormous brass section arranged by people like Lenny Pickett but also electronic beats from John Congleton. With all these cooks in the kitchen,would it be possible for the duo's talents to be able to express their musical points coherently. The results are more surprising than one might think.    One can dress it up any way they want,but the foundation of the music is here is still very much on funk. You can here that on songs such as the opening songs "Who","Weekend In The Dust","Dinner For Two","Ice Age" and "I Am An Ape". Not only are Byrne and Clarke's musical outlooks both highly compatible but on these five numbers the groove is laid on thick for some uniquely produced funk/pop epics. "The Forest Awakes" and "I Should Watch TV" showcase a more prominant Afro-latin rhythm. Nothing new for Byrne of course but the mixture of them with some of the orchestral horn arrangements and creative use of melody again creates a potent groove based set up. On the former song,in fact the influence of the Minneapolis/Prince style use of the drum machine,prominent in hip-hop in years to come,is firmly in play. The only real full on orchestral/progressive pop song on here is "Optimist" with Clarke on lead vocals. Towards the end of the album Byrne takes over heavy on the chunky,soulful groove of "Lightening" and the afro funk explosion of "The One Who Broke Your Heart" with the Dap Kings and the like minded afropop band Antibalas. The album ends with the slower,epic groove of "Outside Of Space And Time" with the swelling and romantic lyrical imagery suiting the music to a tee.    For many people who've considered the innovation of funk in dance music during the 70's as a passing fad usually indelibly linked with the still sometimes controversial disco era,Byrne has consistently proved critics and musical scholars wrong on that regard with his creative way with funk rhythms and his promotion of the original talents who produced them. Funny thing is,only on rare occasions has this ever attracted a wide audience. And for that mostly earlier on in his career. Since he left Talking Heads in the late 1980's,most innovations in pop music have been based in some variation on the dour end of the alternative rock scene. The funk end of it only seemed to crop up occasionally and even then pushed far into the backround with other things. Even if his solo work was hit or miss affairs commercially,he stuck to his guns that the 70's funk/soul era provided the pop world with an excellent base for expansion in it's future. By blending that aesthetic with the musical and songwriting talents of St. Vincent he was again able to fashion yet another successful hybrid from this. An excellent instrumental and melodic epic that should be enough for even the most jaded musical cynic to realize,in terms of music,it hasn't "all been done".
0	Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since. The refrain is something that will stay with you always if you hear it. I still find myself singing that refrain in the back of my head. The album is worth it for just these two songs. The art on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of Christ- drawn by a mutual friend.
0	Awesome song for the movie . Lana Del Rey is the perfect person for the song. Loved the original and love this one more!
0	Great for around the house cleaning or in the evening, or just trying to unwind. Here's my five more words.
0	Relaxing, mood setter and office acceptable. Selection of music for all ocassions.
0	Underrated Wierd Al song. It's dated but a Dead on parody.
0	What I said about the hymns applies to all the ones that I got.  I like it very much just wish I could have received all the songs.,
0	I absolutely love this song and am so glad it had so many downloadable options to listen too!  Thank you!
0	what can i say this is new from Bruno Mars love how he does his music now and especially him and B.O.B. on Nothin' on you
0	I am not a big country fan, but, after hearing the female on a cut from Maroon 5's Hands All Over (Out of Goodbyes), I purchased the single, then decided to buy the CD. I find them all to have very soulful voices, and, suspect this will not be my only purchase.
0	The Latest Leon. More Interesting Music from this Unique Singer
0	Love this CD.  Darius Rucker has such a smooth delivery.  Great follow-up to his previous work.  I hear he did a blues CD as well.  I need to get that.
0	My son LOVES this CD and DVD! When we get in the car he asks for Choo Choo songs and we can jam out together. The songs are longer than what is on the little blurbs on tv which is wonderful.
0	First I want to address some comments about the length of the songs/album.  I can understand what people mean about the songs "feeling" shorter than in the first album, so I looked up the song lengths:  https:/ en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbomb_%28album%29 https:/ en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Select_%28Starbomb_album%29  It turns out, the songs are about equal length.  "Player Select" has one more song and is one minute less than "Starbomb".  I think it's because both Danny's singing and Egoraptor's rapping are significantly faster in this album.  I guess the speed can give it a "rushed" feeling.  Now that THAT is out of the way. THIS IS AWESOME!  Still hilarious!  "Toad Joins the Band", "Glass Joe's Title Fight" and "Inky's Lament"  are just some great examples.  The language is better this album as far as the amount of cursing and sexual references(still- warning to parents).  The lyrics and music are still impressively creative.  I CAN NOT WAIT for the third album!  "You will never catch me.  I am like the Eiffel Tower"  "That doesn't move!"
0	I usually don't like hip-hop, but I love Kellee Maize. Her music is a breath of fresh air, and she is one of the most generous artists I have ever heard! Highly recommended!
0	This song by Blake Sheldon is one of many great songs that he soothes the senses, he is among many who make a living giving use what we want. I like this song very much, but I will not recommend  this song everyone is different you will have to judge for them selfs.
0	A great track from a great artist. Be sure to check out rollingbaby.com for baby stroller related topics.
0	It was a good song then and still is.  Every once and a while I need to be reminded of the past.
0	When I need energy, this tune just gets me going.  Happy sound with toe tapping beat that just makes me happy.
0	Sarah Brightman's voice, showmanship and polished songs are evident in this Cd. This is her Greatest Hits amd it is worth listening to. Brightman will take you to Eden. then to space. then to a land far away with her voice.
0	Steve has another banger,his music never disappoints, I love the collabos and the overall feel  and message of the album. The outro is straight fire and  very fitting because of the current social conditions especially in America.    I hope the people who listen take the message he is sending to look at themselves and the times and think how can I make things better, how can I treat people better.  Yeah man another major album, big up dread.
0	I was a little concerned about how I'd feel about Smoke and Mirrors. . . After an album as amazing as Night Visions, I just wasn't sure if Imagine Dragons could pull off another compilation as incredible as the first. Too often, we see sophomore albums pale in comparison to their freshman counterparts. I'm thrilled to have my concerns proven wrong. I've read a few of the smug reviews from some of the out of touch, condescending magazines panning Smoke and Mirrors but they come off sounding more annoyed than anything at the spiritual undertones in some of the songs and as if they were just waiting to publish their self important criticisms long before the album was released. Whatever the case, this is a pretty great bunch of songs put out by a truly incredible, unique band. Shots, the first song on the album feels like it goes back to their roots a bit- classic Imagine Dragons- it's got a fun, energized beat but with thoughtful lyrics. That's something that throws people off a bit but I love that they take a different approach to some of the emotions they express in their music. They handle difficult or uncomfortable subjects in so many various beats and compilations that everyone will find something that speaks to them. Shots would be my favorite song on the album if I had to choose. Some of the strongest songs (though a case could be made for all of them) are Smoke and Mirrors, Polaroid, Dream, Trouble, and The Fall. If you bought the deluxe addition, Thief and The Unknown are pretty awesome as well. Smoke and Mirrors is raw, beautiful, and offers a surprising, strong chorus even amidst its gentle tone. Polaroid is fun, really catchy, and thoughtful but is on a different vein from Imagine Dragon's other music. One of the things that has thrown people off and has made people accuse the album of being disjointed is that the band included and explored a lot of different, unique sounds in Smoke and Mirrors. Personally, this is something I've loved about this album. I can't help but think this is something more people would enjoy, particularly since there is little that disappoints more in music than when a band becomes stuck in a rut and all their music sounds the same. I love that Imagine Dragons isn't afraid to explore their sound while staying true to themselves and producing one amazing song after another. This is a gem of an album that will keep Imagine Dragons rising with well earned success and deserved recognition. These guys are incredible song writers and powerful musicians and Smoke and Mirrors has only solidified their presence in the music industry. I'm a fan for life.
0	This a beautupiful album. I am choosy about the music I listen to and this on will be listened to over and over.
0	very soulful in this song but indie sounding enough for me too
0	Love this CD.  Uplifting and great to dance to.  Gets the whole household in a good mood!
0	I think this may be Townes's best album.  Heavy country blues element, haunting lyrics, and typical Townes themes: the sad,  the silly, and the sublime.  Delta Momma and Brand New Companion are straight up country-blues tunes.  Either him or Me and the Change of Seasons are beautiful and bitter-sweet sad.  The Tower Song hits the nail on its existential head.  Townes is either the best singer-songwriter in the last 100 years or I am biased.  I recommend you find out for yourself. . .
0	I have not heard a greater song. The indigenous haunts of the guitar, the drums, the theme that resonates with the words. This a most special sound. Reaches into my heart immediately and doesn't let go. I almost don't want to be released from it, and yet I too am unbound.
0	Love it!  The explanation is not fit to print, so I do not want to upset any guidelines.  I will then of course behave myself. :)  Love You Amazon!
0	A good blast from the past for 80's and 90's country.

0	Prime Cuts:  Talkin' About You, Slow Poke, If I Had You  Some "blings" are not just your eye-catching, flashy, and ostentatious ornaments. Rather, they are so revolutionary that they make a career charting statement.  Ever since her debut CD for the now dysfunction Asylum Records, Davis has never made it a secret her penchant for western music.  Though she has made writing and recording contemporary country music her bread and butter, she has always allowed her indulgence for the west to emerge in songs such as "Lone Star Swing," "Yodel Blues" and "Summer Nights in Dixie."  This time round on "Western Bling," Davis has decided to give her pen a rest.  Instead, she has decided to dust off some of the classic gems from the 1920s and 1930s and re-dressed them with a western swing twist.  Hence, she and her co-producer Rich O'Brien have inadvertently created a new genre where fiddles and steel guitars exist conterminously with the tunes of the Gerswhins, Pee Wee Kings and Cindy Walker.  One of this CD's greatest pluses is that it has a very relaxing feel to it.  It's almost as if Davis in her languid and easy going style takes us on a sonic slow journey passed the streets of wildly cascading baskets of fuschia bougainville and pausing to enjoy the eastern sky blazes pink, purple, orange, and red above the still-silhouetted piney hills.  Case in point is the beautiful rendering of Cindy Walker's classic "Baby, That Sure Would Go Good" where her nuanced reading of this romantic ballad is picturesquely sweet.  In a high spirited mode, the ensemble offers a sprightly version of "If I Had You" originally made famous by Bing Crosby.  While she throws off her shoes for some down time with "Slow Poke."  Offering invaluable advice as to how to deal with spousal discontent, "Slow Poke" still have layers of lessons ready for us decades after it has been written.  Some frisky moments abound with Davis' jovial reading of Bob Willis "Talkin' About You," heightened by its call and response chorus by Davis and a group of male Louie Jordan-styled response.  "Nevertheless" is testimonial to how songs of yore have the ability to conjure emotions so real and engaging as this 1931 classic speaks of the first flashes of love.  The dreamy Bobby Darin classic "Beyond the Sea" is the perfect getaway one can enjoy without even leaving your chair.  Davis' delivery here is so soothing you can almost feel the breeze of the ocean blowing across your brow.  Perhaps, if there's a weakness in this otherwise stellar CD, it's that the backings are kept to such a minimalistic level that sometimes it becomes a little soporific.  If the percussion were to be more at the fore creating more of a beat, it would be more engaging.  Also, ballads seem to dominate here and it would be even more interesting if the tempo were to be more varied.  Nevertheless, despite these quibbles, "Western Bling" really strikes new turf:  for who would have thought jazzy old standards and the western music could enjoy such a satisfying marriage?
0	I have been searching for this song for awhile without knowing the title and artist. I was happy to have finally found it. I would like to caution buyers though, the lyrics are extremely disturbing, I can't even say it on this review. When I was searching for the song, I have only heard a portion and haven't heard the full version until I bought it. I just thought it had good rhythm.
0	For Mathis fans it is a good listen.  His volume is not up to Nashville standards but good background music anyway.
0	Rush Fans will tell you, "They are better to go see than to listen to."  I've been present for Rush Performances five times between 1977 and 1981.  I agree with that assessment.  I was deaf in my right Ear for six months due to a welding accident and went to Saginaw, Michigan to see Rush at the end of their Hemispheres Tour that winter.  The Rockets were the Backup Band that night.  Near the end of the show I moved from the floor up to the back center position to get the best sound.  My Ear broke open and drained out and I could here with both ears again.  I was ecstatic.  This composition was one that I could hear properly.  I love it.  They introduced Free Will, Jacob's Ladder, and The Spirit Of Radio after a final Curtain Call.  Sorry to go on so long but I also seem to remember Mr. Lee saying as the Show began, "We're going to do everything tonight", which may be what happened?  These Guys are Top Notch Entertainers.  Oh yeah; I had to wait for more than six months to finally get, Permanent Wave.  My Friends were sick of my promotions of Them by then.  Listen to this without distraction or better yet, go see Rush for yourself.
0	As usual, the Zac Brown Band shines in this album. It is full of great music with grassroots philosophical lyrics!
0	We just got this for Christmas and it's a wonderful CD! My four year old is asking great questions about the songs.

0	This is without a doubt one of the best pop records I've heard in a long time. Stop sleeping on Carly and give her a listen!
0	I made a slideshow / movie for my parents 50th wedding anniversary and this song was a must have.  After about 8 minutes of other pictures I made a nice ending with original pictures from 50 years ago of their wedding.  This song was a must have for the background music.
0	I've like this song for the longest time, a radio station that plays old songs had it on, I've decided to purchase it, and found it easily at amazon
0	Of the many recorded versions, I highly recommend this one. About half way in, the low brass thunders bringing the spirit of the bloodied plains back to life.
0	It just came and in good condition as well. I have always wanted Lauren Daigle CD because I love her songs. I love listening to GOD songs. I am very pleased with this purchase.
0	High powered swing band.  The lead singer almost sounds like Tom Waits performing swing music.  It really moves!
0	Never have I been so excited by the emergence of a new music artist. Scudieri's lyrics are of the time-honored style with a sharp cutting edge to them. His musical approach is innovative and fresh. It's like seeing the  New Millenium's Springsteen. only better! His live performance can move  you to tears and unbridled joy! This is an artist with a message. do not  miss it!
0	I start this album before going to bed and listen to before falling asleep. So, I enjoy these sounds they do relax me.  As for the Deep Sleep part of it ; I can say that I have not been awakened by any of this music while sleeping.  I don't  know which is my favorite they all sound good.

0	I saw and heard Bonamassa for the first time while watching the video of this concert on TV. I was blown away by Joe's prowess with a guitar and amazed at his talent. I had to get the CD so I could enjoy this performance again and again.
0	Classic Cat Stevens.  Wild World belongs in any collection of folk rock music.  The song is from his most prolific period off of the Tea for Tillman album.  The song is about his relationship with an American woman.  A must have for the genre.
0	Love that "I Just Want You" made it on a record of hers - finally!  Thanks Sara, you're the best.
0	This song is used in my water aerobics class.  The song has a good beat for a warm up or a casual song during the class.  We have fun with this song.  It tells you the simple steps to do and it creates a different movement in class.
0	I love this song and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.
0	My younger brother felt the same way, and it always reminds me of him.  Great song, but not typical.
0	I loooove Aural Vampire, so when I saw that Exo-Chika had a part in this, I was immediately curious about it.  I must say that I'm happily surprised! The music has a definite vampiric quality about it, with Fu~ki's drawling, mournful vocals working in perfect unison to the thin, fairy-like singing of Exo-Chika. If you're craving a bubble-gum bit of J-pop, this isn't the song you'd want. But if you're in love with the visual kei branch of Japanese rock, then spend the 99 cents to buy this song- it's well worth it! :)
0	For the session its the Best can't go wrong,  Mr. Hollens and Jackie Evancho
0	I had heard the song before but didn't pay much attention to it.  Then my daughter danced to it for her performance at summer camp in 2013.  Then I listened to it often and every time we hear it we still crank it up and say that it's "her song."  We will enjoy this one for decades. <3
0	Love this CD so much played every day now my friends and family hide it from me.
0	The single has a slow start but it's building on its strength. With the video and Oprah show coming, the single is heading to #1, much like the slow start Lady Gaga had with "Just Dance".
0	to me, the most beautiful musical rendition of this classic ever! ibrings back memories of watching the tv special every yeart
0	His head voice and perfect vowel placement makes this cover incredible.
0	Great album! She really knows how to appeal to all ages! Thank goodness for some new refreshing music that I don't have to sensor to much for my daughter.
0	Monolithic Baby! is the sixth full-length Monster Magnet studio album, it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time.  The album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.  The aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.  The fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.  Regardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'  Most Monster Magnet fans are fond of Dave's Vocals and lyrics, which are up to their usual high standard on this record, and most fans will be more than happy with this album, the songwriting is of a very high caliber and there are so many rocking songs that this is one of the most direct, focused and in your face records the band have made.  Of course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments. If that describes your feelings in similar situations then maybe give Monolithic Baby! a miss, elsewise do not hesitate to pick up a copy, it really is a very enjoyable record.
0	I heard this beautiful piece at a recent SF Symphony concert. This rendition matches what I experienced musically that evening anc captures all of the somber beauty of the piece.
0	bishop Morton has always been a inspiration to me this song gives me hope and know to wait on the lord
0	Great new direction by M83.  Love the new tunes!
0	Have had the pleasure to hear Wayne in person on more than one occasion, and always enjoy his playing.  This CD is simply an amazing one-man show, unrehearsed and with outstanding fidelity.  If you enjoy a true pick artist, this is one of the finest albums you will ever hear.  The fact that he also built the guitar that he played (hence the title) makes it even more special.
0	This is wonderful!  Laura Woodley Osman has a real heart for deep soaking worship and prayer! If you are looking to go deeper in your worship I highly recommend this!
0	I am glad I ordered this CD.  It is a great selection of songs, including Bobby Caldwell's "What You Won't Do For Love" (the song used in the most current Mitsubishi commercial on TV).  A+!
0	This was always an awesome song that brought tears to my eyes.  At the first of this year my Aunt had pastad away. This song was sang at her funeral and something come over me when that song was played at the funeral. As soon as I got home I dowloaded it and it and play it at least one time per day.
0	He wrote all kinds of music but this was my favorite . Super romantic. Having someone sing this to you. you can't help but fall in love
0	only problem is when I download . we should be able to receive the inside training booklet by mail. send it
0	I purchased this version of the song to put on my running / workout playlist and love it! Really gets you going!
0	Every song on this CD is great!  We listened to it from Austin to Dallas and back again.  Glad I bought it.
0	I've always thought Micky had the best voice in the Monkees, and this album proves that at the age of 67, he is sounding better than ever! I won't go through every song, just my favorites - but every song here is done well!  Starting with the Beatles "Good Morning, Good Morning", a wonderful rendition that makes me smile. You don't mess too much with the Beatles, and Micky didn't. Just enough to make it his own, without putzing up what the Beatles created.  "Diary" When David Gates sang and wrote this, it was a quiet, wistful, sad and beautiful tune. Micky does that part, perfectly, but also says that pain is not always quiet - the pure emotion when he goes up to the top of his range and practically screams "The love she'd waited for was someone else, not me!" shows a man who has been dragged through an emotional roller coaster. Amazing!  "Quiet Desperation" - a song that Micky wrote, proving that as a songwriter he has advanced far beyond the days of "Shorty Blackwell" and "Randy Scouse Git" (I love both of those songs, by the way) and speaking of.  "Randy Scouse Git" - Incredible. He has slowed it down, made the whole song far more emotional and put everything he has in it - magnificent!  "Do Not Ask For Love" - That jaw-dropping I mentioned in the title of this review? Here it is. This has been turned a capella, and all 30 (yes thirty) vocal parts are done by Micky! When the song ended, I realized that I had been sitting with my can of soda poised at my mouth for the entire length of the song - and had forgotten to do anything with it! Listen to the song. Once it's over, remember that you have to start breathing again!  "Remember" - Micky's long and luxurious tribute to his friend Harry Nilsson is a perfect way to end the album and a perfect choice for the album's title.  All in all, this is one of the best Monkees albums never made! BUY IT! NOW!
0	If you could sum up the entire No Limit Soldiers in 1 track, this would be it. This 7 minute posse cut is the best example of each members individual style. The beat is perfect Bounce music.
0	I like a few of their songs and this one rocks so much that when I hear it, I just get motivated.  Wonderful.  BUT, I HATED the video.  For a Christian rock band, it was somewhat inappropriate.
0	I like this song but I love Jasmine Thompson cover of the song better than the original version song by Macy Grey I don't know if you ever heard of Jasmine Thompson but you should definitely check her out on YouTube she a 16 girl with an amazing voice trust me you'll thank me later
0	I was simply amazed at how fast this shipped and arrived! I love it and I am very pleased with the whole process.
0	Air by Richard Stolzman is a very relaxing piece of music. I love putting this music on before going to sleep.
0	This is so Redman, so hip-hop that I ignored the 3 weed songs back to back to back but in a time when raw hip hop is missing, this s* made my day!
0	Yes, now we are talking good ole music.
0	Nelly Furtado completely remade herself in 2006.  Her earlier work, including hits "I'm Like a Bird" and "Powerless" were fun and entertaining songs (and Nelly is a very attractive, appealing artist), but they didn't excite the mass audiences.  They had more appeal to the Adult Contemporary chart.    2006 saw the debut of her song "Promiscuous", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take "Promiscuous" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This set the tone for the remainder of her album "Loose", which showed her new image to be genuine instead of posed.
0	Great song listen to at work and it keeps me on my toes. Beat keeps you going. Great band looking for more songs
0	After maybe three years of having this Acid Mothers collaboration CD title on my want list, I finally manage to land down a physical copy. Believe me, first time you see this German import CD - it will undoubtedly grab your (full) attention. Gig took place (as at first, I didn't realize it was a live CD) in February, 2008 somewhere in Japan. "Flexitwister" sounds very similar to at least one of the tunes on Acid Mothers Guru Guru's 'Psychedelic Navigator' disc (see my review). Certainly got a lot of damage out of the twenty-four minute ~jamming~ title track "Underdogg Express" - in the last maybe five minutes the trio gets real experimentally psych - very cool as well as the compelling thirteen-minute "In The Cave Of The Mountain Gods". Closing out all this cosmic mayhem is the typical Acid Mothers freak-out "Spirit Of Nara". Line-up: Kawabata Makoto - guitar, Atsushi Tsuyama - bass & vocals and Mani Neumeier - drums, editing & vocals. Saw that this title is also available on 2-lp vinyl with an extra Guru Guru cut of "Bo Diddley". Needless to say, most highly recommended.
0	After sweet their demo, Half Hour of Power, I didn't know if Sum41 could pull it off again with All Killer No Filler.  They did! This album is sweeet! .
0	My husband is a huge fan.  Surprised him with this.  It's all he listens to now.  Recommend for every Beach Boys fan!
0	This is a very interesting set.  You get lots of variety.  Richter, Gilels, Oistrakh, Kogan, Tretiakov, Shafran, Kremer, Kissin, Berman, Rostropovich.  It is quite a line up.  None of the recordings are the equivalent of high quality Western recordings of the same time.  The sound is generally always good enough to listen to the music with pleasure.  What you get is a window into he musical scene of classical music in Russia.  The way that the Soviet musicians play is interesting.  There is a different style than what you hard elsewhere.  The playing is often very demonstrative.  It is dynamic and kind of heavy sometimes.  It seems with the fact that most conductors now go all over the world, the sounds of orchestras have kind of melded together.  The sound from Soviet Russia is kind of "old fashioned" sounding.  The recordings are usually mono and kind of boxy.  That is just what Soviet orchestras sounded like on the recordings available to us here.  Most of the recordings here should not be anyone's first choice or even second choice, but it is interesting and after all, the cost is just approximately $1.00 per disc.  That is a very good deal.  Lastly, how frequently will you find recordings of Tretiakov, Shafran, or Berman.  It is really nice to get recordings of Kogan.  I have some others.  I think that he is frequently overlooked.  There are lots of live recordings of Richter, but it is always great to hear more concert recordings of Gilels.
0	I love this cd it has alot of really good different songs. I had a killer test today and I snuck in my cd player and when we were done I relaxed while listening to this cd! It's awsoem so go out and buy it!
0	All our favorite Johnny Cash songs.  My husband is a big fan of Johnny Cash as I am.  We both grew up with this kind of music and love the albums.
0	This cd is by far the greatest ever produced by the Gaither Vocal Band.  Bill, Guy, David and Russ have shown, through this effort, that they are tremendously talented and versatile in their style of music.  The Gospel World should be honored to claim such talent.  I am a GVB fan from way back, and have heard a lot of their music, but this cd, the choice of songs, the arrangement of each song, the blend of voices, is so touching!  I listen to it over and over again.  It is truly a God-inspired work.  My life has been spiritually enhanced by this cd.  I hope they continue to produce such works.  My prayers are with them.
0	Great alternative song, could easily be a pop song.  Very catchy and love the backing music sounds.  This band has a bunch of good tracks!
1	I paid a dollar for someone speaking nonsense about Star Wars, set to music.  And I loved it. It's really well done, and I've followed BLR for a while.  Really good job, good song, good point, fun, and funny.
1	This set of Cd's is well read and easy to follow. I would suggest it for anyone. Give it a listen
1	This is the best rock song of all time. If you disagree, sorry but you're just wrong.
1	This album has four to five great old-time rock hits from Billy Squier to Joe Walsh and Enimem adds a current rap and beat that makes these songs come alive again. Nobody does it better.
1	I am only 17 and i know good music and mary j is a great artist I will always love her music
1	My husband plays this CD often at home and in the car. The first time he heard this talented group sing he wanted the CD.
1	This is a really great song of praise! Iwould highly recommend buying the song and adding it to a worship mix!.
1	Great music for a great film.  The director completes this "Wes Anderson-esque" love story/comedy with carefully selected artists and tunes that gracefully nudge the story along as the film Gods intended.  The Phoenix Foundation shines along with the other talented musicians and songsmiths.  I can't stop listening to this soundtrack!  One thing I did though was make a disc that bypassed the snippets of dialogue that are peppered in between songs that do more to distract us from the music than they accomplish and besides, Tarantino already did it.  A+ though on a well crafted soundtrack.
1	Maksyl fan suggest this. Like it a lot
1	Loved this lively arrangement of Arirang. Nicely done!
1	this song has a great beat and good sound. Very good for two-step. It also has good instruments. I would buy it again
1	After years of grinding on the mixtape circuit, Meek finally releases his debut album. Back in 2005 he actually had a little buzz out here in South Jersey, not to mention Philly isn't far from New Jersey anyway. Alot of people in my high school was listening to him, he even did a few songs with a local artist out here years ago. I always thought he could rap, but I hated his style of rapping, my boys had a few his of mixtapes (The Real Me Pt. 1 & 2). I enjoy some of his music alot more now than I did in the past. Power 99fm, a popular radio station in my area played some of his joints in regular rotation like "Rose Red" and "In My Bag". I listened to the come Up Show by Cosmic Kev on Friday nights and he always played the latest Meek joints, as well as other Philly artist so I'm familiar with the Philly rap scene.  Now on to the album, the album starts off with a great intro track produced by Tone the Beat Bully, where he spits "I used to pray for times like this/ to rhyme like this /So I had to grind like that to shine like this" and "See my dreams unfold/ nightmares come true/ It was time to marry the game and I said Yeah I do", then on "In God We Trust" he talks about things people do for money, especially people who snitch to get rich. Meek hits the clubs for "Young & Gettin' It" featuring Kirko Bangz, its a catchy song but it would of been way better without the autotune. Things get real on the intense Boi-1da produced "Traumatized", where Meek reminisces about friends e lost and threatens to kill the dude who murdered his father with lines like "When I find the n* that killed my daddy know I'mma ride Hope you hear me, I'mma kill you n* To let you know that I don't feel you n*/ Yeah, you ripped my family apart and made my momma cry/ So when I see you n* it's gon' be a homicide/ Cuz I was only a toddler you left me traumatized". Other gems include "Maybach Curtains" featuring Nas, John Legend and Rick Ross, "Tony Story Pt. 2, "Polo & Shelltops" and "Who you Around" featuring Mary J.Blige.  With all that being said, there is some less than average joints like "Believe It", which is typical a Rick Ross type song with a trap beat and repetitive hook that we heard from him a thousand times already "I gotta a bad b* in my Chevy /Sellin Miley Cyrus in my brand new Monte Carlo/ I got that Justin Bieber please believe it!", just in case nobody understood those lines, hes making drug references. "Rich & Famous" featuring Louie V is a automatic skip, this song is talking about buying a girls love wth a atrocious hook "I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be? /I wanna buy your love, everything is on me/ Lifestyle of the rich and the famous/ Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?", "Lay Up" featuring Wale, Rick Ross and Trey Songz could be a hit, but it looks better on paper.  Overall Meek drops a solid debut, but his limited subject matter holds him back from reaching his full potential. Meek spends too much time addressing haters, and bragging about what hes got to the point it can turn listeners away. He also lacks consistency, unlike his Philly peers (Beanie Sigel, Young Gunz, Eve, and Freeway) whos debut albums were street and had replay value as well, and they didn't sound repetitive.  At the end of the day Meek is rapping what his life is about, things he seen, he really is from streets and he holds the streets down. When he raps, his aggressiveness makes you believe what hes saying. Its good to see him bring Philly hip hop back to the mainstream. One more issue I had was that it seems like he used his best tracks for his Dreamchasers mixtapes, songs like "House Party", "Lean wit It" and "Dreamchasers Featuring Beanie Sigel" could of easily replaced some of the filler on here and made it a 4 star album. On his next solo album I would like to see him grow more as an artist.
1	Fantastic new release by Lesley Gore, bunch of rare tracks such as "I Struck A Match" and many more! Just a great CD!  It was worth waiting for! Larry Marshall Meadows
1	This song takes me back to a time when music was full of innocence.  I've always loved Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and have downloaded several songs from their library.  This one is fun, upbeat, and you can't help but sing along.
1	Anybody who knows Arnold Stang was the voice of "Top Cat" (as I do), and is curious as to what some of his other work was like, will most likely enjoy these spins he gives on two classic tales. (Stang made this album three years before he began work on "Top Cat.") Although Stang directed this toward the younger set (as he stated on the liner notes on the back cover), most adults - or anybody who wishes to listen to *clean* humor - will also enjoy his comedic readings of these two stories. Now why can't they make *real* comedy albums like this today, that appeal to *all* ages and *isn't* indecent?
1	Every song is straight from Scripture and anointed. Thank you so much!
1	Who would have ever thought of writing about a simple red solo cup, it is so ridiculous it is cute
1	This album stands up to Johnny's highest standards as set by all past work. His God-given talent remains beyond excellent. If you like Johnny Mathis you will love this album.
1	Pleasant end of the day. or anytime you need to refocus and relax.  Soothing with slowly moving to relaxation. Would recommend.
1	It is an awesome song, you can understand and feel the lyrics of the song.  A great cd to be played at any party.  Great job Kenny.
1	The cd is amazing! All of the songs are great, and the voices are wonderful to listen to.
1	I ordered this music for a ladies event where the theme was "Girls Just Want To Have Fun" & of course we needed Cyndi Lauper's music!  The music arrived timely as promised and added to the fun of our event!
1	I like this song from Rihanna. Was nice to be able to purchase the song I wanted! I play it constantly.
1	I've been following your music since your freshman album. No matter what stage I'm in within my life. MUSIC gets me thru it. I"m a REAL house head. This was RIGHT ON TIME! Real DEEP! Keep it up!
1	Song is good.  Wanted to find it on Frostwire.  Couldn't find it.  Bought it on Amazon.  Song sounds like it should.  I don't really know what else to say, thats pretty much it.
1	I purchased this Cd for a specific song and ended up liking the entire CD! They have a nice sound!
1	Great song by Demi. Wait a minute aren't they all? This song is perfect just like all her other songs. It's a great song to get up and dance to!
1	So, Eartha Kitt recorded Old Fashioned Girl, so many years ago.  I loved it then, and I love it now.
1	Great singer and is fantastic singing the Classics as well as Gospel music.  Love this CD. He's also a very funny comedian.
1	But, I miss a little of keyboard (Richard Wight). :(
1	One of the best guitar players. Definitely on the same level as Hendrix etc. Unfortunately, he never got the attention he deserved.
1	this is one of my favorite songs from Cat Stevens. im not a big Cat Stevens fan but I do love Father and Son!
1	Can't say enough about this great CD.  It brings more glory to God and there was a woman who was responsible for Dylan's conversion to Christianity somewhere along the line.  This is feel good music, it sounds like Fleetwood Mac on Easter Sunday.  They album is a production miracle and Dylan's obvious love for Christ is contagious.  There has never been a better modern example of religious music set to modern rock instrumentation.  This is the secret development of Dylan's career that may never be articulated in public.
1	On their seventh album "Drones" finds Muse undergoing a style change, it finds them trading in the electro-rock that characterized their last albums for a more classic hard rock sound with underlining electro beats and the results is awesome. Drones is one of (is not) their best alum to date. It's strong, consistent, and interesting especially the two interludes. The album starts off on a high note and maintains and at times surpassed it (especially with [Drill Sergeant] and Psycho. Tracks to watch out for are Dead Inside, [Drill Sergeant]/Psycho (which are two separate tracks should have been one as [Drill Sergeant] is an interlude that leads into Psycho.), Reapers (whose intro reminds me of Power Rangers), and [JFK]/Defector (again two separate tracks). Great album, hopefully this is just the beginning a phase 3 for them.
1	Great song to build your faith. Thank You. God Bless You!
1	This album brings back some great memories! It is a clear recording and has great playback via Amazon Cloud on my Android phone!
1	I am a fan of Bruno Mars, and especially like this song. the download speed and ease are great. one of the first songs I downloaded to my new Kindle!
1	Bill Cosby is singing but he does a good job on this on. The bass and drums are butt kickin!.  I believe it's the guys from the 'Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band' playing on this.  Soulful as hell!
1	I pre-ordered this and Amazon had it delivered to my mailbox on the release date.  I'm going to start this off by saying that I'm a music lover in general (multiple genres) and I love Natalie Merchant's work.  Going back to 10,000 Maniacs and then progressing into her solo career, there are numerous songs she's created that I consider classics.  I'll probably never tire of hearing a lot of those songs.  And, like millions of other people, I think the original "Tigerlily" album is exceptional.  With that said, I don't think this re-recorded version of "Tigerlily" will have broad appeal.  It's overall very good, it's just that the sound is very mature and almost a bit down/depressing.  I cannot see the tracks from "Paradise is There" being particularly popular beyond Natalie Merchant's existing fan base who already love the "Tigerlily" tracks.  And, maybe that's OK because her fan base is pretty huge.  I will say that the music CD comes with an absolutely exceptional DVD "rockumentary" that alone is worth the purchase price.  It was fascinating to learn about Natalie Merchant's personal and musical history.  All of the insight shared by Natalie in the documentary made me like "Tigerlily" even more, and it was already one of my favorite CDs.  Furthermore, a very nice, small multi-language lyric book is also included.  The book, music CD, and DVD are a fantastic package for the money.  More About the Music CD: This new CD is kind of an "unplugged" version of "Tigerlily" that is particularly suited to older audiences (mid-40s and up).  The re-recorded songs on "Paradise is There" are for the most part very subdued when compared to the original recordings on "Tigerlily".  "Paradise is There" is heavily based upon orchestral and string arrangements.  It's an almost classical sounding record at certain points.  Much of the drumming is done with brushes instead of drumsticks and that mellows out a lot of the songs.  It's a lusher, "easy listening" version of "Tigerlily".  I can't see a lot of people under the age of 40 or so having an appreciation of this new CD.  But, I suppose that's the age range of many 10,000 Maniacs fans.  The new recordings are slower, and almost sad feeling, interpretations of the original recordings.  Natalie's wonderfully unique voice is noticeably more mature.  Slower and more mature sounding are not inherently bad qualities.  It's just that these new versions of the "Tigerlily" songs are almost a bit too sad in feeling.  It's a tough call.  The songs are great, but the record is a bit of a downer to listen to because of it's overall pace and feel.  This would not be the record to listen to on a day that you want to feel uplifted or happy.  On the original "Tigerlily", guitarist Jennifer Turner masterfully crafted and played memorable riffs, licks, and guitar solos that were nearly as present and important as Natalie's vocals on key tracks such as "Carnival", "Wonder", and "I May Know The Word".  By sharp contrast, the re-recorded versions of all the songs are heavily weighted towards Natalie's vocals and it's hard to find any standout individual instruments because of the orchestral nature of much of the new music.  The orchestral instruments are almost like background support for Natalie as opposed to how Jennifer Turner's guitar was almost "singing" equally right alongside Natalie in some of the original recordings.  Where I think the more mature feel of this record works is on "San Andreas Fault", "I May Know The Word", and on "Seven Years".  I found the new interpretations of those three songs to be on par with, if not better in some ways, than the orignal "Tigerlily" versions.  SUMMARY: I would recommend this CD to any fan of 10,000 Maniacs and Natalie Merchant.  I would especially recommend this CD to anyone who likes the "Tigerlily" album simply because of the fantastic DVD rockumentary.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable and insightful documentary.
1	I use to listen to this song when I was a teenager & everytime I hear it It takes me back to some good memories.
1	This song feeds my spirit, mind , body, soul. Thanks for these great words. I truly need them day to day.
1	Love this song - even the one with the real title.  Got this one because I don't want to offend guests when I play it.
1	This is "THEE" Christmas CD to own this holiday season !  With song's like: Mr. Hankey the christmas poo. The Lonely Jew on Christmas. and Swiss Colony Beef Log. you can't go wrong ! There are afew stinkers here,  but not enough to ruin this soon to be classic. so do yourself a favor and  buy this tape. don't let Mr. Hankey slip through your hand's this  Christmas.
1	He has done it again. I love this song! It is upbeat and is a beautiful message. My 3 year old son loves it too. :)
1	This is a good song.  Carrie underwood is a great artist with lots of talent. You should biy this song you won't reget it.
1	This is from the DVD release from the Gaither Gospel Series called "Heaven".  Wintley Phipps stepped up to the microphone and began this dramatic narrative about God sending Death himself to pick up a dying sister. The power of that voice is something incredible to experience.  The subject might sound depressing, but you'd be wrong in assuming that. This is an amazing narrative! Get it!
1	Excellent, excellent soundtrack!  I hope it wins next year's Oscars!
1	West Texas may be a long way from Ireland, but this album is a reminder that the Irish didn't stop at the eastern seaboard. Its a good mix of Western and Irish styles with a measure of blues throughout. In particular I liked "No Lark in the Morning." Thanks.
1	it's a really great song and it has a good price. the song is leans more of a dark tone but yet it's not so dark. the melody of the song is kind of a sad song
1	Huge fan of Mumford & Sons and absolutely love this album. Cannot wait to see them this fall when they come to Houston. Highly recommend it!
1	Chris can sing so beautifully and the children make this song more wonderful. Together they all sound so you know amazing. Love that is about love and God's love for us. Hello love
1	My 15 month old great niece just loves this song. So do I.
1	If you come from a dysfunctional family (or it turns into one), like Oi/Punk, and drink to deal with the holidays, this is a perfect song to crank in grandma's face.  There aren't that many songs that encapsilate the Oi christmas sound but this one is very impressive and hits home each and every time it's heard.  If you like this, I have to pass on the word for another band. You have to hear The Vandals Christmas album, Oi! to the World.  Oi! Oi! Oi!  Thanks Dropkick
1	Sounded really good. Awesome quality
1	So good! Great harmonies, great compilations of some of the Psalms!
1	But they remixed the first record.  This is generally a good thing, but they did not follow the original mix-mapping.
1	Some of the remastered CD of mono age sound pretty harsh, not this one. And the price is more than reasonable.
1	Chili Pepper B-sides are seriously better then most singles
1	This has to be the best CD put out by  The Script. Absolutely love this album. The drumming and guitar work is wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.
1	Hank III sounds a lot like Grand Dad and is a really good version of this song.
1	Don't get me wrong, the first album isn't bad, but I just found it kinda boring- like I never listen to number 2 or 8.  On I-EMPIRE I enjoy every song. I really love Rite of Spring (#11) and how that small piano is again used like in Start the Machine from the other album.  The songs are more upbeat and really fun to listen to!  GO BUY IT!  However, the cd I bought had the two bonus acoustic tracks of Everything's Magic and Do It For Me Now.  Haha yeah. Don't expect too much from those.
1	I can't hear it often enough. Its beauty and power are unsurpassed.
1	Great song by a great singer. How can you can go wrong.
1	I love this song. It is one of my favorite songs playing on the radio right now. Love the music & the singing is beautiful!
1	I love Don Moen's singing, I have never heard any song he has song I did not like. I listen to "God Will Make Away" almost daily, it is very uplifting and inspired.
1	I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. If you love Andrew McMahon, going back to Something Corporate or Jack's Mannequin, you'll love this record. A couple of the songs aren't among his strongest, and the production seems kind of punched up, as though whoever did the final mix did'n't completely trust the material.  But it's definitely worth having if you're a fan, which I am.
1	She has the music, the range and the voice that few have. One of a handful of truly great voices.
1	LOVE IT! AWESOME VOICE. REMINDS ME OF RONNIE DUNN
1	Its Pink Floyd what else needs to be said
1	the sound quality was great! I like the fact that I can hear it properly without blasting the volume on my mp3.
1	I was looking for something diferent to add to my Gospel Show Lineup, I am familiar with Francesca's work, and this song did not disappoint.  A beautiful new take on Christmas Music delivered by a more than talented songstress - I definitely would recommend!
1	Man, I saw these guys last year for the Halloween metal show at the Nocturnal, along with fellow Portlanders Engorged, Carnifex, and Stovokor (those Klingon dudes). Last Empire certainly stood out from the death and grind, as they played pure and classic old school power metal; it was so ridiculous it ruled. I picked up the CD and it's suprisingly kick-ass. If you can find a copy, I'd definately recommend getting it if you like any sort of heavy metal. "We're gonna take you back, to a lost land, of the dark elfs."
1	This is one of my favorites, of course I have a lot of old country favorites but love Faron Young and just love this song.
1	One of my old time favorites. She sings it from the heart!
1	This song hits home, and gives me a great worship experience with the Lord God Almighty! Excellent recording and song.
1	I grew up with this music, and Aunty Myrtel K. Hilo, The Singing Cab Driver, was one of the most popular female artists in Hawai'i throughout the 60's - 80's.  This album is a classic, with many of the popular old-time Hawaiian songs, and her style is flawless.  I totally recommend this to fellow Hula Dancers, Hawaiian Musicians and anyone who is in search of traditional style Hawaiian music, and the true sound of the people and our island way of life.  NOT for someone who thinks that Jawaiian/Reggae style music is the Island sound. YUK!
1	Awesome music! High energy and full of overlapping time signatures and quick beat changes. The musicianship is incredible throughout. The album is recorded well and mixed well. It should put your system to the test. Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy this one!
1	I heard Abbey in the early 90's sing Bird Alone - knocked me off my feet.  Ran out to buy the  album You Gotta Pay the Band, wrote down all the lyrics in beautiful fonts and framed Bird Alone, took it to Fat Tuesday's where she was performing. My wife and I hardly began speaking to her hoping she'd invite us backstage, and as she reached out her hand as I was presenting the framed Bird Alone lyrics, suddenly she heard someone next to us - Diana Ross with her son at the next table.  Damn, she retracted her hand and in one quick step she was gone. / I played You Gotta Pay the Band and The World Is Falling Down, two masterpieces of sound and song with Stan Getz and Jackie Maclean, respectively.  I o.d.ed on those albums playing them day and night and after six months couldn't listen to them for months, ha. Years later, recently, I'm attempting to write down the tunes with the improvisational parts by Stan Getz, but it is very formidable.
1	Can't help but to smile when I hear this song
1	Found the song that I was looking for.
1	Party's clear country voice brings out the earthy beauty of this song.  The background music makes you feel this part of the country and takes me back to my roots of several generations ago.
1	I heard this song years ago on the end of a John Leguizamo  show and I liked it , so it took me awhile to find it but as usual I found it on Amazon.
1	Though Waits is an acquired taste, this song is great for us long time fans.  He hits it right with every aspect of this song and I hope to hear this in a set of music if he ever tours my way again.
1	I bought it because the download after the record purchase did not include this song.  No big deal when I purchased it for my computer playback.
1	Oscar Brand is always great.  There are some unique ballads on this album.  Good value, great artist.
1	Ok for all of you who don't know AZ because you're too busy listening and copping that garbage they play on the radio, he's been one of the best MC'S in the game since his verse on Life's a bitch (see Nas - Illmatic). I've been a fan of his since DOE OR DIE he is one of the most underrated MC'S. His flow is unbelievable, his delivery, his rhymes and the production is reminiscent to the 90's hip-hop. But anyway back to A*W*O*L this is a dope cd but it's missing 2 hot songs that should have been on here that were going to be on FINAL CALL. "Seems that way" and "Serious" featuring Nas, if those 2 tracks would have been on here this album would have gotten 5 stars from me, but don't let that stop you from copping this album GO GET IT!  (.)
1	I haven't been excited about any new music in nearly a decade. Then I found Home Free.  I can't get enough of their songs, their charisma, and their entertainment value. They are good, clean, fun for the whole family! Thanks so much for being top notch talent in a time when good music can be hard to find.
1	One of Flame's best albums for sure.  Flame favors a more contemporary sound with this record which is an unnecessary, but welcome, addition.  His lyricism and delivery are good enough that he wouldn't need to make any changes, but he proves here that he's still a relevant artist with a lot of ambition.
1	This album has two of my favorite things Brent Smith and cover songs. I love his voice and the way they covered the song. This album is definitely worth buying!
1	The Navy Band's arrangement of Donna Diana is interesting and livelier than played with an orchestra. However, my main interest in the piece lies with  the old TV series,  Sergeant Preston of  the Yukon.
1	For those of us who remember these old hits, this is a great way to enjoy them without buying the whole CD.
1	Had heard this at a venue played on big speakers / Was worth the wait and I love it ! Thanks / Not a bad track in the bunch / very cool Merle and Willie together / favorites are Missing Johnny Cash and Its all goin to pot.
1	I'm using this song for a performance. I love it!
1	I love it. Takes a few listens to start hearing how great it really is. Although there are many musical nods to old Floyd songs, the album is a very new sounding, aggressive, sensitive, and progressive bunch of songs. Be open to new stuff and just buy this gem
1	one of the best songs by Mark Chestnut. Reminds me of my mother.
1	Before purchasing this album you need to ask yourself. do you love Bob Dylan primarily because of the sound of his voice, or do you love Bob Dylan primarily as a songwriter? If you mostly appreciate him as a songwriter and not so much for the quality of his voice, you're going to want to pass. These are mostly traditional Christmas songs he's singing. not like he's written/sung an entire new approach to Christmas carols here. I am an all around Bob Dylan lover, so I knew what to expect and am extremely happy with the album!
1	this is one of the best  cd i have . i have at least 1000. i rate it in the top 30. blues pink floyde
1	This tune is too good. I would have loved to see it featured in the show.
1	this song has a melancholic tone to it that just sucks you in and the message of the song is something solid but also left for interpretation.
1	This track bring the emotion once experienced in the theather, the best rendition of this song, my daughter loves it and I can't stop singing it also because of her, love how a song and the interpretation of Idina makes one feel so good, thank you Disney
1	It's great to see Pooh back in his groove.  Love the EP, looking forward to the Album.
1	Not my favorite Simple Plan cd, but still enjoyed it!
1	Beyond Orange is the creation of Andrew Campbell (guitars, basses, mandolin, tiples, and misc instruments)and Emir Islay (keyboards, drums, programming). This album is organic, lush, melodic, and filled with gems that individually reveal themselves upon repeated listening. I look forward to future releases from this duo.
1	I purchase a lot of mp3 downloads from Amazon, and they are all wonderful. If I buy it, it's because I like it :).
1	Trans Siberian and the Holidays. need I say more? Of course I do because Amazon forces us to write far longer review then necessary. lol
1	This is one of the best recordings I've seen on Amazon of this beautiful and peaceful song. I highly recommend. It has a Christmas feel, even though I play it all year around.
1	Does this Album come as a CD? I Love , absolutely love the Facts of Life Song, and I would like to have that song playing in  my car. Please Amazon do something and find this Album in CD, thanks.
1	This song should have been on the album. I have no idea why it would have been cut and only released on the B-sides collection. Anyways, the song is fantastic. Check it out.
1	This has become one of my favorite praise songs of the year.  The video that goes with it is great also.
1	This is one of my most favorite Jazz Fusion bands. This is a classic.
1	This was my first heavy metal album. All my older friends listened to them, and I used some birthday money sent in a gift card from a relative, to buy "Somewhere in Time", on cassette. I was thirteen, in the mids 80s, riding my bike, when "Somewhere in Time" first beamed into my head through the earphones of a Sony walkman. I was hooked.  What other band gave you history lessons wrapped in a power metal ballad? You could study for class with "Alexander the Great" and other similar historical-based songs on their other albums. I also loved how long many of their songs were and the way the song would totally change the pace or feel halfway through or segue into an extended solo before coming back to the end. I like all the songs on the album, but I had a special fondness for "Wasted Years", "Sea of Madness", "Stranger in a Strange Land", and "Alexander the Great".  Pure heavy metal from the classic metal era. I still love Iron Maiden's Somewhere In Time, (well) over twenty years later.  \^/_
1	This song has been going through my head, especially the line "Mother, you are worried about way too many things, you haven't even noticed that it's getting to be spring"
1	This is a truly beautiful cd although it doesn't play on all my music players. I don't know why but I am able to listen to on one of my music boxes.
1	. and we were just starting to realize what the Vietnam Vets had and were going through.  It was great that The Charlie Daniels Band put out this song to help awaken Americans to the plight of the Vietnam Vets.  Even so, it wasn't until the 90s that my adopted hometown finally held a formal coming home parade and weekend celebration for the Vietnam Vets.  It was long overdue and very emotional.
1	Allison Krauss is one of my favorite singers. On this song it seems like the "sound" techs did not have her voice "tuned" in to the recording equipment. It seemed too soft and fuzzy to me. I have 7 or 8 albums with her on them. This is not one of her best "technical" efforts. Of course "The Three Bells" is a "classic" song that is pretty hard to "screw up".
1	Ivers' high voice, spare instrumentation, and surrealist lyrics light up some dark remote galaxy in the subconscious.
1	I recently started weight lifting/exercising in order to burn fat and get in shape for the military when someone recommended this to me.  The product shipped very quickly quickly and I must say I'm very satisfied with the results so far!  I whole heartedly recommend this product to anybody else!
1	I really enjoyed this cd. I have ordered many many Marvin Sease cd's, but Donnie Ray nails it with "I'd Rather Have You Than Memories". That song really puts everything into perspective when it comes to the love of your family. I'm so happy to add this cd to my collection and I am ordering two more Donnie Ray cd's right now as I speak. Great cd to take along on a road trip!
1	Mandy has an old fashion country sound.  She is known for her Patsy Cline music.  This album was well done!  I love every second of this album!  I will listen to this album EVERY Christmas, and will continue to collect her albums.
1	Every single song caresses my heart & soul. A must-have album! Tegan & Sara's voices make each song a piece of art. A wonderland.
1	Great music to study to! Every track I have heard to date by this musician is outstanding. He is one of the best ambient music artists I've ever heard.
1	Bought this because I already liked it. No surprises here.
1	This song exhibits a vocal arrangement which is inspirational.  I absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this for any choir with adventurous leaders.
1	Katy Perry is wonderful. Her music is catchy and happy and this song is a must have for any Katy Perry fan!
1	I love the Clark Sisters, all  of them, they are soldiers for Christ, and pioneers in the Gospel. You can never go wrong with their music. I love to relax and listen to this song, because there is nothing like Sunday morning. Going to worship my Savior, cause He did something for me. Take the weight off my shoulders. Oh thank you, Jesus.
1	If you want the quintessential Greg Brown, this is the CD for you. If you want to see and hear Greg and get to know who this songbird is on DVD, well that's included too. You'll play this Cd to death; and you will never tire of hearing Greg cover Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie on the DVD. Nice offering in every way.
1	FOXY BROWN IS THE HOTTEST FEMALE MC. HER FIRST ALBUM WAS HOT,THE SECOND ONE WAS GOOD, BUT THIS CD IS ON FIRE. MY FAVORITE TRACKS ARE "7:30", BECAUSE SHE SPEAKS ABOUT WHAT SHE IS UPSET ABOUT, AND THE BEAT IS SLAMMIN'."CANDY", HER NEXT SINGLE WILL BE PUMPING IN THE RADIO AND CLUBS BECAUSE ITS BANGIN'. "TABLES WILL TURN" HAS A PHAT JAMAICAN BEAT AND IT WILL BE BUMPING IN THE CLUB AS WELL. I ALSO LIKE "GANSTA BOOGIE", "THE LETTER", "BOUT MY PAPER", AND "I DON'T CARE(THE WHITE FEMALE RAPPER ON THIS TRACK THAT PUTS IT DOWN), I'M SURE WE ALL WILL HEAR MORE OF HER(KORI). OVERALL, HER CD IS HOT, SO COP IT.
1	I play the C/D in the morning to start my day right.  It is just fun to sing along with song.  Other of Penrods songs demonstrates what a gift his voice is.  I have recommended this C/D to others already.
1	Of course they've done it again with another awesome album.  More music to rock your soul by.
1	Great song,  good price, a must have for a mp3 collection for songs on the go. I recomend this song.
1	Epic in scale & exquisitely wrought, Mumford & Sons sophomore release, Babel, does not disappoint.  Love abounds in many forms - in turn soaringly beautiful, achingly heartfelt, & profoundly moving, the Sons wear their hearts on their metaphoric sleeves with much candor & pathos.  At times jubilant, defiant & foot-stompingly giddy while in quieter moments forlorn & bereft, Babel successfully captures the revival tent spirit of M&S live, demanding your full attention while engaging both mind & heart.  This is an album best served whole, the sum being even greater than its parts.  Gentlemen of the Road indeed.
1	Looking for something new?  Christa Wells' music fits the bill.  Her music ranges from monumentally uplifting (On the Mountain) to a kickin' love song (I Want to Know that Man) to a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the reality of life (Don't call it love).  Although some songs have Christian overtones, I'd hesitate to put Christa's music in the category of contemporary Christian.  Her tones echo those of Sarah McLachlan and her music is much more far-reaching than most contemporary Christian music.  Personally, I find that both her music and lyrics are amazingly uplifting and inspiring, whether I'm lying in a hammock, throwing a party or doing dishes.  Christa's lyrics manage to cross the line musically - those who love rock, Christian music, gospel, folk or just plain GOOD MUSIC will adore her - give her free song a listen and I'm sure you'll be her next big fan!
1	Did not expect to have EI put this out, when I heard this in a store. I like this better than the censored-version for the masses, because musicians/artists should not censor themselves.
1	Kem sings about love, a universal subject. Some of his songs are spiritual, which is terrific. His lyrics are intellectual. Kem is a very talented musician. He sings about letting things happen in their own time, missing your lover, wanting to be with your lover, cherishing moments, finding peace, and so on. It's a mixture of jazz and r&b/soul. I highly recommend this album to everyone.
1	This CD is wonderful! I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it kept catching my attention, so I finally bought it and loaded it onto my ipod. Every time I hear these songs I feel so uplifted and encouraged and it puts me in a great mood. I've been recommending this CD to everyone I know. Well worth the money.
1	I wanted this for my grandma who passed away last forth of July. Though I miss her dearly, there is no escaping my feelings and this song has them all. This was her song for my uncle when he passed, so I know this fits perfectly. Love you Abuelita.
1	Cool song downloaded for the kids but we like it too. The song was from a soundtrack and is super catchy.
1	I'm so moved by her singing.  I can not wait for the new CD to drop. She truly uses her gift. Amen!
1	But the audio level is so low I can't put it in a playlist without adjusting the level each time it plays.
1	Very bold of Martha to take on Aerosmith's classic Dream On - She killed it. Love this album, love Martha but I get the feeling she is holding back on the vocal power. Martha we love strength, we love power! Please remix It's My Time, Dream On and Something Good. Love all the tracks. Wish your album success.
1	James sounds great! A little older deeper should but sooooo smooth! A sound like a perfect fit hand in glove! If you either love the red sox or hate the yankees (which covers most of the globe) you will love Angels of Fenway. The title cut is so beautiful and fun!
1	Great song, great artist, great price. Quick download, great quality MP3, and with Amazon Cloud I can download it again and again if I need to. Thanks!
1	Some great performances on this CD. If you like Maze you should enjoy this tribute CD.
1	Loved it!  Got the CD in perfect timing since Hiroshima came for a concert.  I was so excited and lucky because I was able to get my CD autographed by the group.  As usual, this CD was a mixture of jazz, only this time more newer material.
1	Here is the track listing for this cassette tape:1)One of These Days 2)Money  3)Sheep 4)Shine on You Crazy Diamond 5)Wish You Were Here 6)Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2
1	I have always loved this song. Every since I heard it on KLOVE it has made my mornings. Very Awesome.
1	best cd i bought in a year. I play it constantly when I do art and it is so soothing.
1	J Moss is one of my favorite singers.  He sings with a passion for Jesus.  Psalm 150 lets you know that he praises God like the Psalm says we should.  This song makes you want to praise God right along wit him!
1	This is the song that clued me into Avicii and so far I'm sold. I could listen to this one over and over, and sometimes I do.
1	this is a nice version of Yanni's Within Attraction. recommended.
1	The tracts are short but they allow lots of them. There are many different sounds so perhaps will help you to select what king of music you prefer.
1	Just purchased this and absolutely love it.  Soft, romantic, orchestral music of popular love songs.  Perfect for a quiet evening with your sweetie, a candlelit dinner or anytime you want to calm and refresh your soul.
1	The Crystal is one of my favorite girl group.  Happy to find this cd.
1	I've been listening to this CD since I was 16.  This got me through some really dark times. most recently however, it was the cause of my near drowning in the bathtub. lol yeah. I fell asleep listening to it. :/
1	This tune goes back to my party day's and when I heard this playing in some flick I wound up adding this to my Old a Rock playlist and a few others they did. not Mony Mony though. never took to that tune.
1	This album is amazing.  I can't stop listening to it.  I loved "Take-offs and Landings" but this is even better.
1	I absolutely love this song. I could jam it 2,000 times in a row and still be singing out loud. When/if I get married again, this will definitely be my wedding song.
1	We've always been fans of Jamaican steel band music and this mp3 won't disappoint you.  I think you'll enjoy it.
1	The Poets "Scotland's No. 1 Group" - A fascinating collection of rare singles and unreleased tracks by one of Scotland's best rock bands of the late 1960s, with a stylistic range similar to that of the English band Pretty Things, ranging from Yardbirds-y R&B to more psychedelic and edgier material. A fascinating glimpse at one of the Northern British rock/garage scene's great lost bands.  Recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)
1	Having Scott Reeder pound on that bass while Corey in his baritone voice carrying the feeling of the song makes it a complete masterpiece
1	I really love the creepy carnival atmosphere of the music
1	Excellent song. it's catchy and carries a good message. Definitely a song you can jam out to!
1	Lyrics and instrumentals are incredible. You can't listen to this on low. Crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing!
1	Love this song so much I have some of the words on my wall.
1	the dixie cups are the greatest bands in the world
1	Kanye West- whether or not you like him as a person, you cannot deny this man's musical genius.  Black Skinhead is another great, hard-hitting song from him.  5 stars well-deserved.
1	I haven't listened to the entire album through in its entirety yet which almost seems like a must for an eclectic group like Gungor.  That being said, many of the individual tracks are grab-you-by-the-seat-of-your-pants surprising.  If you like formulaic pop music this is not for you.  If you're wondering if you want this album listen to "When Death Dies".  If the lyrics of that song make sense to you and the unusual rhythms have you tapping your feet, you'll like the album. (PS- there's a live version of that song on youtube that's mind-blowing!)  Although this isn't a contemporary "worship album", the reverence for God's Love is obvious and pervasive.  For people who enjoy secular musical groups like They Might Be Giants or Cake this album is a no-brainer.  There is a blatant Truth in some of the lyrics that some people may find shocking while others may think it's refreshing.  If you like your music on the predictable side this isn't for you.  My one criticism of the album is that it goes from undeniably interesting music into the realm of weird and whiney sometimes.  That's just my personal preference though.
1	Simply a great song - timeless and classic.  Could listen to it 20 years from now.  Wish artist could have made more like it .
1	This is old but it still hits HOME! Mary Mary Mary. has done it again. Tell your man you can't sleep without him BABY!
1	Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's instrumental jazz version of, "We Three Kings," provides romantic music for a winter evening.  You and your special someone will appreciate the season even more when you play this song.  So light the fire, dim the overhead lights, and turn on the Christmas tree lights.  Then settle in with your favorite drink, cuddle up and let the waves of the music, along with the love of the season, wash over you.  Thank you for the free download!
1	relaxing this makes me want to sing along, Brings back many memories.  Would recommend to anyone.  Hope to see more like this.
1	Christmas masterpieces shows the "good ole's" presented in fresh way. It will have your toes tapping before you know it. Gotta have it!
1	1.  Stolen Moments (UFO Remix) 2.  United Future Airlines (Sound Of Gold Mix) Remix - DJ Emma 3.  United Future Airlines (Palm Skins Productions Remix) 4.  United Future Airlines (Double-Veys Dub) Remix - Ben Wilcox  1995 Talkin' Loud UK
1	I believe that the Funk Brothers played on this. The playing is impeccable as is Mr Ruffin's soulful growl. One of the greatest soul singers was David Ruffin. This song rivals "My Girl" imo, that's how good it is. Everything that was great about Motown is present in this obscure soul jam from '69
1	Chris is a mega star in my book and I love this song.  I am going nut with the MP3's because most of my CD collection is packed from moving and I cannot find it.  I just had to hear it again.
1	Liked hearing it on a holiday family road trip.  Not sure about the barking dogs in the end?  Neverther the less, Lindsey Buckingham is awesome!
1	Love this song so much. Reminds us to pray, give it to God, move on and trust! Great song of encouragement!
1	This is a great song that depicts the mental struggle we have as believers.  The world doesnt decide what we are worth, God does. S.D.G
1	" Tell me how you feel tonight,Look into my eyes and tell me what's on your mind, I just want to hold you all night long, wake up in your arms. Do you think that's wrong? But I can't, cause you won't. Why don't you risk it? put all your worries aside. Fall into me tonight, Why don't you take the chance, let go of all your wrongs and rights" - Cat Beach, from her album "love me out Loud" Check it out, This song hit's home, Love it!
1	Really you need a review for 5sos, they rock! I'm 46 and saw them in concert, so fun!
1	For Boswell Sisters and Connee Boswell fans, this album is a "must have," for this is Miss Boswell's final album. After this LP was cut, she only made one more commercially released record, a 45RPM single on the independent Charles label from 1963.  For those new to the Boswell legacy, you will be interested to know that Connee had been making records since 1925, so when this Design album hit the market in 1958, she was already a well-established and highly influential jazz and popular singer. Her career had spanned several recording companies, with her first record (along with her sisters Martha and Vet, the Boswell Sisters) was made in New Orleans in 1925 for Victor. There were a few sides released on the Okeh and Victor labels in 1930, then a series of records by Connee and the Boswell Sisters on Brunswick and Decca. After the Boswell Sisters broke up in 1936, she continued recording for Decca until 1946, briefly recorded a few sides for Apollo, returned to Decca in 1951-1956, back to RCA Victor and finally, two LP's made for Design in 1958.  When this record was released, jazz and vocal big band standards still somewhat shared the charts with Rock and Roll, though the era of the jazz pop vocalist was passing. Also, Connee was past her prime and as one fan has said, the fabric of her voice had begun to unravel by the time this record was made. That's not to say her singing isn't top knotch- she does a fine job here but this isn't her best work.  The tracks:  Everything I've Got Belongs to You You're Nearer I Could Write a Book My Funny Valentine I Didn't Know What Time It Was My Romance The Lady Is a Tramp Bewitched Where or When There's a Small Motel  My personal favorite is "Where or When."  As to the recording quality itself, the records are available in high fidelity mono or hi-fi stereophonic; however, I will warn any purchaser of the LP's (or the less common reel-to-reel) that the stereo versions suffer from exceptionally poor engineering, what might be best described as an experimental stereo, resulting in odd effects and at times, Connee being drowned out by the orchestra. This makes the listening experience less than stellar.  So all of that being said, you decide you want to give a listen but you don't have a record player or reel-to-reel player? Since this album has never been released on a properly remastered CD with this cover, you'll have to shop around for a long out-of-print CD called "An Evening with Connee Boswell," on the Pickwick label.  Enjoy!
1	Love all of Linda taylor's work, and this "Ny Garden" really hits the spot for me whenever I need a 'pick me up' or a little 'energy' boost. Loved Linda on the old Whose Line Is It Anyway, and on the revamped 2013/2014 one too.
1	Billy Currington is a great artist. His CD is the Best I recieved it for my birthday back in October. I listen to it alot. Billy has a great voice. "Walk A Little Straighter" made me cry the first time i heard it.
1	Alanis is back!  I, for one, can't say I'm too excited by this.  And after a quick couple of listens to this at a friend's house, my lethargy seems to be well-founded.  I've always kinda liked Alanis, well sorta kinda.  I liked her as a peppy teen on Star Search, I was both enthralled and disgusted by her nekkid suit video, and I wanted to be in the car with her (maybe she'd let me borrow that cool hat she was wearing) in that dopey video for that song from the similarly caustic "Jagged Little Pill".  Well, this album's not all that much different than the last two. Sure, she's done the writing her self.  But. is that such a good thing?  Her tunes are tuneful and the playing is top-notch and very catchy.  But it's the lyrics Heavy Hop Dop can't get behind.  It's the same old woe-is-me, mopey, men are bad-I am sad kinda garbage she's been spitting out for the past five years.  And I've had enough.  There's enough misery around Hoppy's life that I don't have to listen to some multi-millionaire pound my ears with her miserable encounters.  Of course, she does seem to make the most of them.  And I admire her for that.  To summarize:  Good tunes.  Good playing.  Annoying lyrics.  No nekkid suit.
1	I love Imagine Dragons and when I heard this on the radio I had to have it for my iPhone.  Great song!
1	not crazy about but it is fun music for parties and spinning.but not for kids i do not have more words
1	I have been waiting on this album since her last album.  She did her thing on this one.  Brandy is a true talent and it shines through in her music on this album.  She opened the door to her heart and soul and it is beautiful.  I downloaded it from iTunes so I'm not sure if the cd has all of the extras that I got, but when she sang long distance a capella, i could feel it.  She did the same thing with A Capella (Something's Missing)  She shows her impeccable talent with vocals and harmony.  Beautiful.  Don't sleep on this album.  Top Songs:  The Whole CD!
1	Good CD. Although it took a while to receive it as it came from Japan
1	Jason Grays song " Christmas is coming" is definitely a great Christian Song for the Christmas season. very upbeat and has a great sound.
1	She has proved she isn't going anywhere and I like every song she does. I cant wait for her new cd's. .
1	This was quite a surprise, as after the past few Megadeth albums, I was seriously considering not giving this album a chance. I was interested in the new lineup - Chris Broderick is an amazing guitarist, but it was clear he wasn't happy in Megadeth and was not able to contribute much to the writing. So here comes Kiko Loureira and Chris Adler to inject some new life into things, and I must say things have certainly turned around. This is probably a top 5-6 album for Megadeth, the five star bar being set by Rust In Peace and Countdown to Extinction. The "Megadeth sound" is still there production-wise and the musicianship is outstanding - Kiko can really shred with the best of them. It's strange that listening to this, I don't really pay attention to the drums - they are fine, but your attention is not drawn to them. Chris Adler reserves his really good stuff for Lamb of God, I guess. The songs are very strong, at least the first half of the album. "Fatal Illusion" is a great song - odd, off kilter intro that leads into a killer bass line by Ellefson, and then some good ole thrash - this song is most reminiscent of the Rust in Peace era. "Death from Within" and "Bullet to the Brain" are also great, more modern sounding Megadeth songs, both with catchy verses and choruses. Things drop off after that. "Post American World" is a "Symphony of Destruction" rip off, but with a lackluster chorus, and silly, preachy lyrics. "Poisonous Shadows" and "Lying in State" are sorta boring - not memorable. The instrumental "Conquer or Die", is a nice extended solo essentially - great chops, but not anything to rave about as far as a song. "The Emperor" is a punky, tongue in cheek uptempo song that reminds me of something off of Cryptic Writings. I like it more and more on repeated listens - growing on me. The last song, a cover of "Foreign Policy", is not necessary - seems out of place. All in all, I think most Megadeth fans will find something to enjoy on Dystopia -cool riffs, interesting solos, typical Dave lyrics, tight thrash grooves, etc. A solid 4 star album.
1	imagine industrial, mixed with dope and disturbed.if you enjoy those bands you will love it.they did an amazing version of a nine inch nails song only available on the deluxe version. I am very happy with this purchase and haven't been able to put this CD out my CD player.
1	HI DEAR OFFICER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SENDING MY CD OK
1	I got this mp3 to use at church for a prelude, and am very happy with it.  I love the song and this is the best version I found on Amazon.  Recommended!
1	What can I say? a wonderful CD by a wonderful pianist. A wonderful backqround for a quiet evening with friends.
1	Another great song from David Crowder. His music is incomparable and no one writes or performs uplifting or upbeat meditative songs for the soul like he does. Another winner.
1	it touches my soul, and it tell a little story I heard this the first time I was in army basic fort cell ok, c-5 training bat. blue my mind
1	Another solid song from the new Skillet album that showcases their softer side. While this is not nearly the side if Skillet I often listen to, it is good enough in its own right.  Rating: 4
1	Classic music that sinks into you whole heartedly!
1	One of his finest works.  We had missed him until this CD came out.
1	This song makes me want to be dancing on a tabletop in a club, champagne in hand! I guess it will do for the treadmill as well.
1	Saw this on SOL and was glad to see that Alabama Shakes had a new album.  I really like the passion, tempo changes, and interesting music, but I understand how some people might not enjoy the screaming.  I unfortunately have to pick my opportunities to listen or use headphones.
1	As usual, this is another excellent song (midnight blues) by Joe.  Always crisp, clear, and with feeling, as are his other live concerts.
1	A gorgeous collection of just about all of the short-lived Frenchman's symphonic music apart from the remarkable symphonies. It is up there with the Piano Trio and Violin Sonata (cpo) as thoroughly memorable.
1	I've been listening to this non-stop since I bought it.  I ripped a CD to play in my car.  I NEED HELP.  Also, warning: while the first act is fun raps about the revolution and love-triangle R&B goodness the second act is non-stop sobbing.  Some day I will not need to pull over to the side of the road when the chorus comes in with "the orphanage" on Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story.
1	All the group's major US hits are available elsewhere, and I have them, but I wanted this early, pre-Cummings song I heard on the radio a few years before "These Eyes" hit the charts.
1	I have really enjoyed this cd. Being a 60's guy, I believe that the 60's had the best rock music ever. Including many of the best bands in the history of rock. Back to this CD, all the songs are really done well, like only LLB can. I would have loved a CCR song or two included, such as (Born on The Bayou)or(Suzy Q)from 1969. But really, they can probably do justice on hundreds of 60's songs, I've heard them do at least 20 of them in several of their early shows. This CD is great to have. Mix it with original LLB songs a see how well they compliment. GET THIS CD, IT'S OUTSTANDING Ramos
1	I love this piece. Every time I listen to it, I can imagine a story of something great happening with a happy ending. I never get tired listening to it.
1	Excellent! Great pitch and tone. It's a wonderful rendition that's soothing and stimulating of the soul, all at the same time.
1	Five star. Very moving song that makes you know that your problems are not anything compared to the Lord and what he has done for us. Trouble don"t last always.
1	"5" is Joan Baez singing classic folk songs, (plus "Bachianas Brasileiras"), recorded when her voice was at its most ethereal, clear and effortless, even in the highest notes of the aforementioned "Bachianas Brasileiras".  These songs, sung by Ms. Baez, were such an important part of my musical diet when I was in my twenties, hearing them again brings back wonderful memories and feelings from my youth.  That's not to say these songs belong in the past - the lyrics speak truths that need to be heard no less now than then.
1	Taylor does not disappoint. Fun and upbeat songs along with emotional slow songs. I only skip one or two songs and loved them the first time I heard them.
1	Don't agree with the other reviewer (SJT). These are beautiful works beautifully performed, my favorite Haydn: serious and quiet  music. The melody of the 2nd movement of No. 25 is genius, in my view. I have Op. 76 too, which I also like, though not quite as much as these. In this vein, allow me also to recommend the Boccherini quintets played by Ensemble 415 on Harmonia Mundi: one disc of quintets with two violas, the other of quintets with double bass, both at near-Naxos price.
1	I didn't even know I could enjoy an a capella quartet, but this album has been on repeat for weeks. Brilliantly and creatively executed.
1	This song reminds me when I was a little girl walking down a path in the field of the country the sun shining and all my brothers and sisters are on the farm with me. It a great song because of my child hood life out on 160 areas. Loving freedom.
1	One of my faves from a talented singer
1	It's easy to purchase your favorite songs on Amazon. You have the choice of playing them on your Cloud Player or adding them to your MP3 so you can have them with you.
1	A great medley of Jigs by Mick Moloney on mandolin and Eugene O'Donnell on the fiddle.  One of the few mandolin pieces on the CD where Mick mostly plays tenor banjo.  He's one of the greatest Irish mandolin players in the world.  A classic recording.
1	Saw Barbra in her Broadway debut and have loved her since. This is another special presentation.
1	Totally love tis album. Checked out the girls on the album. Just love how they sound this much better harmonising on this album. this is the next best thing to another Eagles album.
1	Bobby Darin was a versatile, daring performer, and this superb, Christmas album is a testimony to both. His selections are a unique blend of gospel, traditional hymns, and a magnificent rendition of Ave Maria. There's a bonus track of his lovely "Christmas Auld Lang Syne" which, to me, is as classic as Bong Crosby's "White Christmas." This is Darin at his best- although Darin was always at his best. He is one of the true greats.
1	Found this on youtube, loved it and bought it. Great song to play video games to! Definately worth the buy, i will check out more from these guys.
1	An amazing introduction to Reformed theology, and I like this sound better than older Shai Linne records that went for a more epic sound. This is stripped down and terse. Record of the year!
1	This song is absolutely beautiful.  Filled with emotion, it brings tears to my eyes. I could listen to it all day long.
1	I looked at this item but I did not purchase it yet.
1	Great product that works just like it was advertised for.  I would recommend this to anyone needing one.
1	It's a really pretty track.  This song is in the teenie bop category.  It's a slow jam.  It consecutively tops 99 jamz hot five at 8.
1	I recently saw Austin Plaine in concert for the first time (more on that later). It was actually my first exposure to the singer-songwriter, and afterwards I just had to check out his album.  "Austin Plaine" (11 tracks; 38 min.) stars with a gentle "Never Come Back Again", establishing a sound in the alternative country-folk area, not unlike, say, Whiskeytown. "Hard Days" continues those vibes. "Your Love" features Austin's ukulele. "The Other Side of Town" reinforces the Ryan Adams/Whiskeytown comparisons, and that's a good thing of course. "Only Human" finds Plaine in a pensive mood. Other highlights include "The Cost" and of course the album's closing track "Beautiful", where Plaine croons "Oh I had a dream last night/About my withered limbs/Started healing from inside/Inside, we will all be born again/We are beautiful", very nice. In all, this is a surprisingly strong debut album.  I recently saw Austin Plaine and his 4 piece back-up band at the Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. He played an early afternoon set, filling his allotted 30 minutes mostly with songs from this album. Live the songs sounded quite a bit "wilder" and certainly louder than anything you hear on the album. If you have a chance to check him out in concert, please do so. I think you will like what you'll hear.
1	My mind is just too active to meditate much - I have tried. This is the only thing that makes meditation possible for me. As the sound of the bowls fades, I follow it. If my mind drifts, then the striking of a bowl will draw it back again. Not too many new-agey, superfluous sounds. It's perfect.
1	I caught 30 seconds of this song on the last iPad Apple commercial. Impose a very snappy. So I went looking for and managed to find it here on Amazon. Very happy songs I would recommend to anybody, that is needing a mood adjustment. Cheaper than therapy and not as permanent as baseball bats. Ha ha!
1	This is a great song that I heard on the radio and just had to have. I say Just buy it.
1	Excellent quality music! Very happy!
1	I enjoy this album occasionally but the 3rd and 4th Hagar albums are my favorites for this version of Van Halen.
1	Good song. Video is really good. Cute
1	I don't like KP that much but this is a great feel good tune!
1	Great disc from the 80's. Not a ton of filler on here. Album is best when listened to in its entirety.
1	Wife loves the Bruno. and I like him fine.
1	After years of not having BB this comes out of no where and as i expected it blows me out of the water.
1	Great song. Fun for any occasion. Nice mix of hip hop and jazz. One of Fergie's better songs. Buy it.
1	Wonderful Musicians! There voices harmonize so well. There was no way that they could disappoint me, they are from and a part of a group called Celtic Thunder where they are just as Awesome!
1	The words in this song are the same as the words spoken to me groom my fiance. She told me good by on th e phone, She did come back but it was to late. Great song.
1	I was pleasantly surprised when I heard this version of one of my favourite songs in ' It's kind of a funny story ', I just knew I had to look it up and hear the entire thing.  Great music, blissful and well done.
1	What can I say - it's the Temptations, a good song, and it downloads easily. Just perfect in every way.
1	I listen to this song many times over the radio.  I thought it would be good to play it when I wanted.  Sweet song.
1	i have liked Gary morris for a very long time he is one of the greats and it was so so great
1	Words cannot describe my emphatic enthusiasm for this musical.
1	I love this CD.  I bought it as replacement for my roommate's collection, and it is a MUST for any music lover.  Expand your tastes!
1	This track is perfect if you are looking for just rain.  My wife likes to listen to rain while sleeping, but towards the end there are annoying birds that wake you up just as you are drifting off.  I ran across this MP3 while on a trip to Texas.  I forgot to bring a rain maker so I downloaded this to my phone to play while sleeping.  It was exactly what I was looking for, just rain.  If you want an MP3 that only has rain throughout the entire session then give this one a try.
1	Love Eric Clapton! I am very happy with this album and glad I bought it.
1	Heartfelt, well crafted country style music. Crack musicians were used on this album and Pete sings his heart out. Check it out.
1	This album needs to on cd please! Could would please put this album on CD please 
1	His voice remains as clear and beautiful as it did on Sweet  Baby James many years ago.  No one can beat James Taylor in a live performance and this double CD captures all that is great about James Taylor live.  He plays with unbelievable musicians and has amazing back up singers who he has worked with forever. If you have ever seen James Taylor in concert, buy this and it will bring you right back there.  This is definitely in my top ten CD's of all time. Don't loan it to friends though, as I have had to replace it about 5 times because my friends want to keep it!
1	One of those songs you could listen to over and over again on repeat all day.
1	Was what I was looking for. Just wish yall offered the original version by Jeffree.
1	I enjoy Willy's music and this is why I purchased the song.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys Willy Nelson's music.
1	I have only just now discovered the wonder that is Ludovico Einaudi.  I first heard the title track, 'Divenire,' and immediately purchased the whole album.  I wasn't sorry, and I will be purchasing more Ludovico Einaudi in the future.  There is just so much sweeping power and feeling in these pieces.  A true rarity in instrumental music these days.  For me, 'Divenire' and 'Primavera' are the highlight tracks, but I am constantly discovered more little bits of hidden beauty as I listen, so that may change over time.
1	I like what Vashawn does with the message in music. God is a good God, and we love Him. Will continue to listen.
1	This song, is just good country music that reminds everyone what is important as you grow up changes as you become an adult and in just a few words sang by a terrific voice you remember.
1	Since hearing Jack Johnson while stationed in DC, we've been collecting his work. Each CD has been a bit of the same but yet different. Something about the words and how Jack sings them makes it easy to listen to the whole CD. To the Sea is no different. as soon as it arrived I ripped it to our iTunes collection and we grabbed a bottle of wine that night and listened to the whole CD. Really enjoyed it. It is part of our party background music now. Easy listening and not too load. People ask us "who is that" so we just pop open the iTunes list playing and show them. Our Florida Neighbors ending up getting this CD and a few of his earlier works.
1	I LOVE ED SHEERAN SO MUCH HES ASDFGHJKL AND AMAZING IDK HOW TO DESCRIBE IT BUT I LOVE HIM AND THIS SONG
1	OneRepublic is unfortunately an underrated band, but they have true talent, I believe. This song is very different from their "Apologize," but it's just as good!
1	We saw them on the Sing Off show when they won n have been fans every since.
1	Couldn't have chosen two magnificent singers to sing this particular song.
1	i downloaded it to use for background upbeat music on a celebratory power point presentation for an evening church meeting.  It is great! :)
1	This CD is amazing. It's one of my favorite holiday albums I've ever heard. It's funky, soulful, upbeat, and the perfect music to get you moving at a holiday party! I bought the colored limited-edition vinyl!
1	I listen to this track when I go out jogging. It is in my playlist and really gets me going and enduring the trials of the trek
1	Had to have this item to increase our collectibles. Love listening to these sounds as often as we can. Thank You!
1	One of the best albums of the  year!
1	Used this as background music for a personal  travel  photo dvd.  Provided an excellent back ground for the event that was presented in our slide show for family members.
1	Great voice! Great rendition of Hallelujah.
1	I first heard this group when they appeared on Katie Couric's show, and had to buy the record.  Love the harmony!
1	my daughter likes this mix version snd so do I Great song !~ for some reason this review needs 8 more words in order to let me post it so I am using up more spance by telling you this LOL
1	A collection of Mr. Lamar's leftover compiled into an album. Make no mistake the tracks are still socially smart and charged with soul. We may have heard all these songs over time but it's nice to have them collected.
1	When the music starts you automatically think of Marvyn Gaye but it also sounds like Michael Jackson.i think he's done a great job using their sound in the background. I love this song. It will probable be my "summer" song this year that I play over and over.,.
1	Great song I have been looking to add to my collection.
1	I bought this for a friend to complete a CD for her. It sounds great and the price is right!
1	Very lovely, celestial music.  Heard it on an ambient music station.  Nice to work by, meditate by, die while in the background.
1	I never realized that thissong was by them.
1	Josh makes these songs into new memories.  He is fantastic!
1	Great to listen to. For my daughter and the lessons through life. Also Smash Mouth Get knocked down but I get back up again !
1	I used this selection to make a slide show presentation for a bridal/wedding shower. The lyrics wer very smooth and soothing. It was a hit! Knote
1	She is a pure and unspoiled girl and I hope she will always stay that way. Her music is lovely because of the quality of her voice. This cd is no exception, I enjoyed it tremendously.
1	Robert Plant-another truly great artist, still on the road, still in it for the long run.
1	This song reminds me of people I love who have passed on to greener pastures.  It gives me comfort at a time of strife.
1	This song and the video reminds me of the old days of music video, it is silly fun and addictive. Can't wait to surprise my daughters and play this for them in the car.
1	Love the combination of Yo-Yo Ma and Alison Krauss.  A beautiful song.
1	I have been a fan of Deep Purple since 1970 thanks to some great older brothers that turned me onto them. I own all their studio albums and a bunch of their live stuff. My favorite album is Burn. I didn't think they'd ever top their Steve Morse debut Purpendicular. But with this album they have. I have to agree with the critics and say this is their best album since Perfect Strangers. And I've always wanted Bob Ezrin to produce these guys & I can say I was not dissapointed at all.
1	this was the first song my 5 year actively starting singing along to in the backseat - admittedly, I don't like what the lyrics mean to a 5 year old, but he looks so cute singing it and I love FGL!
1	great product, thanks, great service!
1	Easy to download and listen to.  I love Sidewalk Prophets and most all Christian songs can be found on Amazon.com. This song totally gets it!
1	the download was easy to use and love the song, a large selection or variety for all types of music lovers
1	As with most modern hip-hop it is okay the first few times you listen to it, but then it gets old and loses its intrigue.
1	I have always loved Heatwave. This is one of their funky hits, keeps the feet moving and head bopping. A definite must have in your 'classic R & B' collection!
1	I have this entire cd but I wanted to download the digital copy to use it as a ringtone. Sarah Brightman is amazing
1	I came to Kathleen Battle's music via her collaborations with other instrumentalists (guitar/trumpet). This CD is a mixture - some good, some tracks vocally disappointing.
1	What a fantastic album! Sure hope to catch them live someday. Along with Pokey LaFarges' "Something In The Water" and Eilen Jewell's "Sundown Over Ghost Town" this is one of my top picks for 2015.
1	Once again, Susan Boyle has delivered an outstanding performance on 'The Gift'. Her choice of music is eclectic but appropriate to the Christmas Season. Her delivery is beyond belief beautiful touching the hearts and minds of those who are fortunate enough to hear her. At a time when the world is troubled and people need comfort and joy, Ms Boyle's gift to us, a combination of sheer magic and amazing talent, provides a healing and soothing place where listeners can go and find peace.
1	One of the best music cd's I have  heard. If you like bombastic music similar to Carmina Burana, you'll love this. High energy, great entertainment.
1	i was not sure after the last cd.  But after hearing the first 6 songs, i bought it, i was hooked. its dido at her best, sounding fresh, every song is great. If your a dido fan from her first cd, than youll love this one. It make me happy. put a smile on my face, If you want something different from all the music that sounds the same, give this girl who almost got away a chance. it a great cd. thanks dido.
1	I go to sleep every night with this and only have made it through about 3 songs.
1	hot shot guitar slinger ( greg howe ) puts his rock n roll gloves this time out for a tour d force in how to play interested melodic hard rock. fronted by a female vocal ( ala: pink ) all these tracks are worthy of re-peated listens . all killer no filler 5 stars sincerely alex  p.s. if u like this music. check  out alex loda  @  i-tunes
1	One of those songs I remember from my youth. Crazy and weird songs lol! Amazon should have AIFF format however
1	The only question is what took them so long to make a Christmas album?
1	My toddler thoroughly enjoys this CD and requests it every morning in the car on the way to school. I would recommend it.
1	I have loved this band for 20 years and I've never been disappointed in their work, which is insane because I can't even think of another band where I could make that same claim. I know a lot of the long time fans keep waiting for them to make another Adrenaline or Around the Fur, but I've always been more of a fan of the gorgeous side of this band. While I can certainly get down to Chino screaming like a madman and Steph dropping some skull-crushing riffs, I'm much more drawn to their melodic, experimental side. Chino has always been one of my favorite vocalists, right up there with Thom Yorke and Bjork. No one sounds like him and he's given me 20 years of audio bliss that I can't even begin to fully express how much I love and appreciate. I of course love the rest of the band too, which is especially true on this fantastic album. I love that they went with such a riff-heavy, almost prog-rock sound this time around. They all create such an amazing and emotional backdrop for Chino to croon over. Having listened to Gore several times now, I feel it definitely ranks among their best, right up there with White Pony in my opinion. They continue to evolve and develop melodically in such an innovative way. Those looking for a super heavy and guttural album may be left unsatisfied, but this album is full of everything I love about these guys.
1	Great song and great band.  The ability to download music quickly and reasonable is great. Love their music and will definitely get more.
1	Well it's official. This has to be the first/only 1974 and before album i have heard in the soul genre that i really liked- alot! This definitely inspires me to look for more soul albums from the earliest of the 70's. That being said, this one along with everything before their 1976 groove "Ain't No Stoppin Us Now" is on my iPod and high on the 'most played' playlist.
1	This CD is hard to find in stores. Let me tell you, if you haven't heard Colt Ford you have got to look him up on Myspace and listen. He has a unique but very good style of music. I was hooked the first time I heard it!
1	Very Good CD I was very pleased with this CD. I would recommend this album to who enjoys Great music.
1	This album is absolutely phenomenal! I've been a fan of PVRIS for a while now, but finally getting the album on colored vinyl made it so much more awesome. The sound is perfect! Not to mention you get the full hard copy of the album and a digital download!
1	This song is pure Cumbia!  No one does it better than A.B. Quintanilla III Y Los Kumbia All Starz!  Neta!
1	These three boys have tallented voices beyond their years. They have a great future performing throughout the world. OUTSTANDING !
1	Simply love the collection. Adele sings from the heart with such a gift and passion. I just purchased this album with only hearing one song and because I was sure Adele would deliver a beautiful piece of her.
1	From a time when hip hop and west coast rap was at its finest, sherm stick just flows, with smooth lyrics and a good west coast beat. The house party vibe and smooth rhythm, and story of a day in the life in the hood takes you back when hip hop had a serious flow.
1	I use this song for my Christmas light display.  I needed a good, clean, clear version that will play over my radio broadcaster for people to listen to while watching my lights dance.  This version was perfect.  Thank you.
1	The Delirium guys from the Canadian label Netwerk were asked by the German label Dossier Records to put together a compilation of their favorite techno ambiant. The result: a DJ kicks that thomps and bleeps and clickcs. Not quite as mechanical as Autechre, this album offers some extremely organic textures while remaining very groovy. One of my all time favourite.
1	Love this song good melody and the song has alot of feelings that go on in a relationship. Hinder has alot of good music.
1	you're serious? you are looking at reviews?
1	Can't stop listening to this. Great energy in the song and good feeling when you are listening to it. Primarily for snowboarding for me.
1	No song has ever resonated with me as this one
1	My family and I really love this CD because it uplifts the name of the Lord in a fresh, exciting way.
1	One of my favorite songs ever by the great Lou Reed and covered by one of my favorite bands Duran Duran.  Can't get enough of this song.
1	A true story about a good thing tell people that you can be alright with love.
1	Ms. Siegel's focus on the Music of the Americas is a welcome addition to my collection. This recording demonstrates her skills with the instrument and her intonations provide a color and vibrance to the selections.
1	One of the songs by this group came up while I was lsitening to Pandora. I searched them in the MP3 section of Amazon and liked what I heard so ordered the CD's. This one is really good and includes a DVD of a live performance.
1	Very nice artist! one of the best songs, I've heard all year
1	Trying to teach a child a fun way to master skip counting to help with multiplication. pretty near impossible.  This version of songs is the most original.  The music is different.  The story behind each song is different.  At least the kids are not as apt to get as bored listening to a counting song with this album.
1	I bought this LP for the first time, and it became a fan of Vikki.  However, I did not expect that she grew up to be a present wonderful singer.  She is very good at taking in and singing feeling to a song. This is her message from the bottom of heart.
1	This cd is done in the traditional Bob Fitts style. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary. However, the songs are really very, very good. Bob Fitts did put a contemporary spin on things and features 2 songs by his son; Andi Fitts. Those songs are 'I Love To Be With You' and 'Pull Me Closer'. And Andi can sing. You can hear the passion for the art of music in his voice. The song; ' I Love To Be With You' is a winner. I've listened to that one song more times than I've listened to the entire cd. Even if you aren't a Bob Fitts kind of person, get this cd for that one song. I promise you it's that good. I had hoped Andi would release his own cd. I believe he had a cd out called ' Elation's Hand' which proved impossible to purchase. On a whole, for those who know his music and for first timers, this is a great cd from veteran praise and worship singer and leader Bob Fitts.
1	Amazing group ~ purchased 2 as gifts!
1	If you like Patsy or Willie, you will love this one
1	Played this with a graduation slideshow for my son.  BEAUTIFUL!  Made a lot of people, mostly me, cry. Song is so meaningful for anyone moving on in life.
1	This is a good one, the first part of the recording I have been using for some time in meditation.  A bit long, but that should not be much of a problem.
1	Ok, so maybe I'm slighly out of Sabrina's target age group [Disney Channel's devoted audience of tween girls] . but upon hearing Ms. Carpenter sing, I was quite impressed by this girl's vocal abilities.  Unlike numerous DC cohorts, Carpenter can actually sing.  No auto-tune here!  Sabrina Carpenter's the real deal.  The songs on this album are age-appropriate & provide a little something for all ages.  Tracks /notes:  1. Eyes Wide Open - easily the most radio-friendly track on here, hence there's more production [but not to the point Carpenter's voice is unrecognizable] compared to other songs on the album.  Still makes for a fun, catchy opener!  2. Can't Blame a Girl for Trying - has a breezy vibe to it (a la Colbie Callait)  3. The Middle of Starting Over - a G-rated version (melody-wise) of "Trouble" by Natalia Kilks, a singer who's definitely NOT for the kiddos(:  4. We'll Be The Stars - a very inspiring little pop tune!  5. Two Young Hearts - interesting melody; definitely allows Carpenter's vocals to take center stage.  Sounds like "Two More Lonely People" by Miley Cyrus.  6. Your Love's Like - more heavily produced (like the title track); very pop-sounding (again, like the title track)  7. Too Young - sounds a little like Taylor Swift's "Back To December".  Very pretty!  8. Seamless - picking up a country-pop vibe on this one; could picture Carrie Underwood recording this track  9. Right Now - another breezy, light Colbie Caillat-esq. tune.  10. Darling I'm a Mess - a cute little indie pop-sounding track.  11. White Flag - NOT a cover of the Dido song "White Flag".  Once more, an all-out campy pop tune.  12. Best Thing I Got  My only hope for this girl is, once she has "aged out of" DC /the House of Mouse is done with her, Carpenter won't spiral out of control (a la Lindsay, Miley, etc.) as she graduates into adult life because that would be such a waste of talent and a sad sight to see.
1	Awesome . I cryed. Using this song for a photo video for my son and new daughters law love it! Never enough songs for sons . Please make more !
1	I bought this album back in 1980 on vinyl. I was so glad to finally find a used copy in a store here in Houston Texas on CD. I saw Arkangel live in Pasadena Texas at a church auditorium years ago. They were fantastic live as well.  This is definitely pricey, but if you can afford it, it is a great album. Kind of a medieval Christian rock sound. But not hard rock, somewhat mellow classic rock sound. I went on to buy Kemper Crabb's solo LP called The Vigil which is also fantastic. He is or was a member of Arkangel.
1	This is hands down the biggest hip hop song that was released in 2007. It has a great catchy tune and is a huge hit in the clubs. Not to mention the popularity of the ring tone. Get this one if you don't have it already.
1	An awesome take on a classic, I rank it up there with Jimi Hendrix's version.  I don't know what their politics are but if the song is any indication, they love this country.
1	Totally dig it! Great music and great cover.
1	I've purchased from Amazon for over 17 years, and for the first time ever, they missed the delivery deadline.  Twice.  The reason?  This CD was out-of-stock due to demand.  Believe me, it's well deserved.  Lauren's music speaks for itself, and it's worth adding that the CD is also very well recorded.  MP3s are often adequate, but this is one of those albums where the less-lossy CD is very much worthwhile.  This is Grammy material.  PS  Note there is a standard&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/How-Can-It-Be/dp/B00TY6CM20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">How Can It Be</a>&nbsp;and a deluxe "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/How-Can-It-Be-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B01CQY6VT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">How Can It Be [Deluxe Edition</a>]" of the CD, for which the reviews are combined.  I actually have the standard version, and wished I had known about the Deluxe. no matter.  Both are inexpensive compared to what CDs used to cost, but I thought I'd mention it for others.
1	As a long time fan I was waiting for this day to come. A chance to replace my vinyl and cassette collection with CD`s. Well my time has come. The sound of all four albums is pristine. "All this and heaven too" is still one of the best pop albums of any era - "Never let her slip away" might be the perfect sounding pop song. The standard of songwriting & musicianship is unbelievable on every cut. If not for the advent of punk and new wave, Andrew Gold would have been a massive star. As it is, he remains a musician's musician, and even a cursory listen of his Asylum output demonstrates what a torrid state modern music is in. The value of this collection is wonderful. Even if you're unfamiliar with his body of work - do yourself a favor and invest in timeless  quality. (By the way, I love the other albums also - "Whirlwind" actually improves with time and "What's wrong with this Picture" featuring one of my favorite album covers of all time - has some really quality moments but buy it for "All this and heaven too") P.S. While I appreciate bonus material - in this case most of the tracks are not up to the quality of the official albums
1	I'm new to meditation and I enjoyed this guided meditation was good for a beginner like me. Aimee's voice is very relaxing.
1	If you like freestyle music this is the CD to own, contains one slow song, my favorite on this CD "Promise Me" if you can get your hands in this classic, don't think twice, it's great!  Track List:  1:  Show Me  2:  Because Of You  3:  That Boy Of Mine  4:  One Night Affair  5:  Spring Love  6:  Inside Outside  7:  Promise Me  8:  Love Emergency   Enjoy!
1	I have long loved JLA, his versatility and gift with nuance. I am also a sucker for ocean-themed compositions. While Become Ocean doesn't have the high drama of, say, Golijov's "Oceana," it's quite a feat, and I love the way the music transforms over the space of 45 minutes. So happy Adams won a Pulitzer.
1	I have every JT recording he ever made. So happy for the new one.
1	this classic "white rap" album contains some of the most explicit lyrics in the industry. definatly a must own for the up and coming thug. lol
1	Classic soundtrack of a classic movie.
1	You haven't heard One Day at a Time until you've heard Cristy Lane sing it. One Day at a Time is my favorite
1	I use this type of music or background sound for the reiki treatments I give.  I conduct these treatments in a building where although there's not a lot of noise, there is some parking lot noise that drifts up.  Since I've been using this music, my clients have said they just felt they got into their meditative state quicker and deeper allowing the reiki to go where it was needed.  Love it!  Plus - it's long as opposed to going from song to song - that's a huge plus.
1	Love this song!  Brings back good memories!
1	good listening CD.  All her hits.  Enjoy it.
1	Let's All Remember the Hello People & this is a great starting point! Famous anti war song & a great pastoral pop with Hot Jazz & Ragtime & Jug Band music influences! No album this pantomime group did is the same music! They ended up becoming Todd Rundgren's back up band in 1970s (check it out on YouTube) although they were a accomplished creative band in their own right! We NEED a box set of all their recordings! Believe me this album is A+! Finally recovered digitally!
1	The world lost a gem in 2012.  This is vintage Andy Williams at his best.  Melodic, romantic, nostalgic, and classic
1	Elegant, natural, Paul Desmond was one of the great communicators- accessible to all and as natural as breathing out and breathing in.
1	One of the best songs ever from former Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy. I'm a sucker for cello-infused songs (Harry Chapin, the Beatles Eleanor Rigby, etc) and this scratches that itch nicely.
1	I have a very small collection of songs that are on my laptop to play regularly as background for my obsessive reading.  this is one of the 21 out of about 1000 that are in my cloud which I have downloaded to my laptop
1	This song best displays Sheena's vocal range when it soars.
1	All the cds from this series have been worth it.
1	Definitely 4 stars or higher.  It is an airy feel good groove to  make you sit back and appreciate.  Enjoy.
1	I've been a fan of Tori Amos since a friend in college introduced me to Little Earthquakes (more years ago than I care to remember).  I've only listened to this all the way through once, so far, and my initial impression is that it's vintage Tori.  Great piano, the voice that initially captured me, and fantastic lyrics.  My only complaint is that I would have liked something with a little more edge to it as kind of a palate-cleanser.  With all of these songs being fairly similar (vocals, piano, not much else), I was hoping for something just a little different.
1	Why are there only 5 stars?  This song deserves 5 million stars as far as I'm concerned.  it is SO brilliant.  Such perfection!
1	We love Trans- Siberian Orchestra! don't know what else to say about it, other than it is great Christmas music
1	the definitive version of this song. No knock on Jennifer Houston who did a knockout job as well on her version
1	I love this song. I love the beat and the groove
1	Got this song in my head after watching True Detective on TV, so I had to buy it!
1	Kenny Barron is a pro's pro in part because while he always sounds in command of what he's doing, he doesn't like to take it easy either.  This disc features him visiting a carefully picked set of tunes by other composers (only "Madness" is by Barron, & it's actually a fierce themeless modal exploration)- everything from Ellington to Tom Harrell to Hancock, all freshly reconceived.  He's accompanied by another couple of pros, Charlie Haden and Roy Haynes.  The results are satisfying, often memorable jazz.  The album's standout tracks are probably the opening "Take the Coltrane", which, after a fine Haden solo that kicks things off, has an absolutely brilliant piano solo- labyrinthine but precise, with a bright polytonality that catches the ear; & the fine reading of "Bebop", the old bop staple, here cooled down to a medium groove.  Not all of the album is up to those tracks- I find "Madness" too static, for instance, for all of Barron's nimbleness- but this is basically impeccable modern piano-trio jazz.
1	Now this is true to heart solid gospel music!  If you seek down home solid foot stomping gospel, this is *essential.*
1	Best album in years. Solid. Honest. Beautiful. Grounded.
1	This is a great song to wake up to. worshiping before your feet hit the floor!
1	Love this song heard it in a tv ad could find for the longest time best skydiving video song i have
1	This is the most awesome song ever sung I can't put in words how great this song really is must own!
1	After their celebratory 2004 folk entrancement debut EP 'Through The Sun Door', White Magic has evidently turned out to be a one-woman show headed by keyboardist/singer Mira Billote who ,only a few years ago, co-fronted Quix*O*Tic with her sister. While the original White Magic lineup of drummer Miggy Littleton (who has returned to Blood On The Wall) and guitarist Andy McCleod are out to lunch, it is obvious to hear that Billote was the member who steered the Magic's creative wheel and soaked the group's sound with her unmistakeable Grace Slick-meets-Roma-stoytelling-voice.  Much of the music on 'Dat Rosa Mel Apibus' take from the songs "One Note" and "Gypsies Came Marching After" found on the 'Through The Sun Door'EP. The sound of those two songs nearly sculpt, track-by-track, Billote's latest effort as one complete musical thought. Her voice and keyboard style rivet all of the songs and her new collaborators on drums and guitar are more subdued in their playing.  'Through The Sun Door' is far more diverse, although it leaves the feeling of wanting more. 'Dat Rosa Mel Apibus' is a satisfying follow up but songs like "Plain Gold Ring", "Wolves", and "Apocalypse" from thier debut are uncharted and possibly forgotten territories.  4 stars.  p.s. The album cover is one of the best in history. Seriously. See the vinyl version for it's full effect.
1	Putting together a mixed list of cd's and this one had to be on it, loved it as a child and over many years still love it!
1	Have been a long time fan of Barbra, this is a really great CD, thanks
1	Switch - how great you guys are! 'There'll Never Be' is undoubtedly the greatest slo-jam of all times. Love it!
1	I want to echo what everybody else says here - these are fantastic sounding recordings.  A lot of times demo tapes that you buy sound like they were recorded from a suitcase in the closet down the hall.  But not this cd - excellent sounding and some really great songs.  Highly recommended!
1	This is great stuff man. i'm really into blues-rock stuff like BLUES IMAGE, or ALLMAN BROS. BAND. This is great blues. good guitar. good organ. good vibe. rock. mike bloomfield plays a great guitar, and stephen stills fills in great on guitar and vocals. al kooper is classic. fantastic! rock it, in the pocket buddy!
1	I've been listening to Styx since the 70's.  I've worn out the albums, cassettes and CD's.  Now it's time to just get everything in MP3 format.  One down 15,000 to go!
1	DON't have enough space or even words to praise This Album from Paul. Finest Macca
1	Salif Keita won international acclaim in 1987 with his masterpiece Soro, a brilliant fusion of the Malian musical tradition with modern technology. The follow-up, Ko-Yan, was disappointing since his voice seemed to have  been sacrificed to insensitive production. It's therefore a pleasure to  report that Amen was a great return to form, featuring highly melodic,  hook-filled tracks with a sense of space, variety and danceability in which  that mellifluous voice comes into its own. The tracks address contemporary  issues such as the quest for democracy in West Africa in the song Waraya,  but there are also beautiful love songs like the boyant Yele N Na, the  rousing Karifa and the trilingual N B'i Fe. Throughout the album, producer  Joe Zawinul harmoniously reconciles Keita's voice with breezy arrangements  and the technical expertise of the jazz fusionists who assisted Keita in  creating this rivetting slab of sound.
1	I've had this album on repeat since I bought it. I'm so in love with the music and message.
1	Speaking of musicians like Bob Brake and David Kerman should bring to every prog/RIO fan's mind Thinking Plague and 5uuu's. Their somewhat European RIO-influenced type of avant-garde music earned them a solid reputation during the 80's both in their respective bands and as solo artists.  Nimby is a four-piece band consisting of Jerry Wheeler on lead vocals, trombone, harmonica and whistling (listen to "Detour De Jour"); the amazing David Kerman on drums, percussion, and vocals; main writer James Grigsby on guitars, organs, and vocals; and last but not least the multi-dimensional Bob Drake on vocals, bass guitar, keys, violin, and even the banjo. While most of the songs are sung by Wheeler, Bob Drake appears on perhaps the most avant-garde number "Tattoo Removal", a piece with unexpected melodic twists, odd soundscapes, and neat arrangement. Bob Drake has always been one of the forerunners of the American RIO school of thought, but I've always believed, no matter how experimental and bizarre his compositions may be, he's always had one foot in the rock realm. Perhaps it's because of Drake why "Everybody's Hanging", one of the most atonal pieces on the album, still manages to rock and groove relentlessly, as waves of saxophone and swift guitar changes are incorporated. The lyrics on Songs for Adults are quite humorous, but the band will fearlessly explore themes of death, murder and suicide on the banjo-filled "Thanks Dialysis Man!" or just hum along wordless melodies on the cool bass and percussion-captured "Helper Monkey", with a chorus that is repeated from start to finish. Wheeler's harmonica playing on "The Mass is Crass" embraces both bluegrass and country elements, but it would be daft to imagine any country fan actually listening to it, considering the avant-garde vocal approach applied by the quartet.  Recorded in Southern France in only a few days, the songs are short and compact with a distinct live feel to them. Listeners of these artists' earlier bands will immediately pick up on what was intended with these pieces, while newcomers may find it hard to grasp on first listen. Just looking at the weird song titles should give them an idea of what to expect. For fans of Slapp Happy, 5uu's, Vril, U-Totem and many other experimentalist indie artists. _ Tracklisting-  Slap the Patch . Midlife Crisis . Four Ways to Love . Remember the Time . I'm the Grumpy Old Man Now . Detour De Jour . Tattoo Removal . Everybody's Hanging . Thanks Dialysis Man! . Helper Monkey . Disability Waitress . Empty Words . The Ballad of Nimby . The Mass is Crass . Not in My Backyard
1	This album is a true gem of its kind for all collectors have experienced Ren child. The Americans had Michael Jackson and Donny Osmond as a child star and Canada took Ren Simard.
1	I was impressed.  I've always been a fan of progressive rock.  Not a huge fan of Primus nor of Sean Lennon's stuff overall, but this combination worked out well.  There are some really good tracks on this album that keep me listening to it.
1	Very motivational song, I listen to it when I start my workout
1	I have been a Tony Terry fan since the 80's and actually still have this in album form. Two very strong hits in With You that I think actually went to #1 R & B in the 80's and Head over Heels. He had another decent song in Everlasting Love. The rest was pretty average (I.E. two or three stars maybe). It is hard to argue with the strength of With You and Head over Heels.
1	The truth about this album whether you loved it or hated it is that it will always be remembered. This was a time when mainstream made a pivotal shift toward grunge and alternative rock.  I personally don't believe Nirvana was the best band at the time given Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains, nor do I think Nevermind was the best album at the time.  I do consider this to be Nirvana's best work though and the only Nirvana album (aside from Unplugged) that really appealed to me.  To be concise the songs on Nevermind rocked out (and still do) and it's the reason why so many of them are considered classic grunge songs.  The success of this album is furthered exemplified by its volume of sales and overwhelming popularity back in the early 90s.  Definitely worth a listen if you enjoyed that era of music.
1	The very best of Vern Gosdin.  The Voice was gone too soon.
1	Ur So Gay is a novelty song about her ex husband Russell Brand and how he was so "gay."  She cites many examples of how he is so gay but he doesn't even like boys.  For instance, "I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears who wears more makeup than [me]."  The song plays on the stereotypes that most of us have about gay people.  The song is supposed to be humorous and her lyrics are very witty.  It is also a jab at hipster guys.
1	Everything Sevendust has ever put out I love!
1	I only downloaded one song but it was a good one so I am sure the rest of the music will be good.  I just discovered this group and my little grandbaby loves to go to sleep with this.  It is smoothing.  It is truly a keeper
1	It's a good song, and was less annoying before it started becoming highly overplayed on the radio. Still cheaper than the money iTunes wants.
1	Great album with a list of quality songs.
1	Very sweet Ladino song - very fun to introduce it to kids!
1	Over 200 renditions of this song, but this is our favorite.
1	This may not be every last work of Stravinsky's, but consider yourself extremely lucky to have this 22-CD set in your collection. Stereo sound was just dawning and Igor Stravinsky undertook to supervise the vast majority of his works for Columbia Records (now Sony Classical). They span his creative lifetime from the early song cycle The Faun and the Shepherdess and the Symphony in E Flat Major to his mid-1960's valedictory works, Requiem Canticles and a setting of Edward Lear's poem The Owl and the Pussycat. Most of the works requiring orchestra are conducted by Stravinsky himself. Others are conducted by his disciple Robert Craft. Stravinsky plays piano in some works and each and every recording was made under his direct supervision so we understand what his intentions were with each work. It is a must-have for all devotees of the great Russian master.
1	Fun, fun, fun another memory courtesy of my choices ant the soundtrack from the 70's
1	Absolutely incredible.  Full of raw emotion.  The original was an all-time classic part of the American musical history.  This song is better.
1	i enjoyed this song its very cool my kind of music gotta love Marilyn Manson one of my fav artists
1	I think that Billy Currington is a great country singer and is going to go far.  I highly recommend this cd to any country fan
1	I set this on repeat and sleep all night. It sounds like white noise and whales. Most of the time I can't hear it- even if I wake up a little bit. It just sort of blends into the sound of sleep, but it also drowns out noisy neighbors. It really helps me tap into those deep sleep waves.
1	Brahms is so exquisite, especially when played by Emanuel Ax
1	Glad to be able to get it digital.  Brings back good memories,  I missed hearing the song and will enjoy it.
1	Influences from Terminator, John Carpenter, Vangelis, and just about every 80s sci fi action movie, but all as a coherent whole with its own theme. Really great music to work to. :)
1	I absolutely love this song. I like older music, R&B, soulful music. Amazon has it all at a great price. No problems downloading this to my tablet.
1	I love music, especially five seconds of summer and I was not disappointed with this album. Definitely a rad album I've recommended it to all my friends! Looove it and have not stopped listening to it! 
1	This performance of the six Roumanian Folk Dances has the energy and style authentic to the genre.  A real keeper.
1	A sensational song made even better by instrumental subtraction. This pared down version allows the vocals to really shine. Heard recently that "Need You Now" was the most-played song worldwide the year it was released. I'm not surprised.
1	This is one of my favorite love songs brings back lots of good memories some of the best years of my life cruising the streets and just chillin
1	Awesome reminder of the love of God!
1	During an initial run of three albums (SITTING IN, LOGGINS & MESSINA, and FULL SAIL), and to a certain extent on a 4th (MOTHER LODE), Kenny Loggins and Jimmy Messina threw down a defining moment of American folk music fused into progressive rock, jazz, and exploratory existential folk musings.  The result was stupendous.  In some ways it outshined their forerunners in the UK (Traffic for example) by being more accessible to various genre and those audiences.  I had all three of the first albums on vinyl, eventually replaced by CD and more recently by remastered reissues, however, during the interim between CD issues, I wanted to avail myself of the best tracks from their progressive side, for my digital listening experiences.  If you want to just pick the absolute best jams that L&M had to offer in long form, these classic rock staples are musical masterpieces:  Trilogy and Same Old Wine from SITTIN' IN Golden Ribbons and Angry Eyes from LOGGINS & MESSINA You Need A Man/Coming To You and Pathway To Glory from FULL SAIL  Same Old Wine, The Pathway To Glory, and Golden Ribbons are in particular exemplary classics in the protest music subgenre, Golden Ribbons being one of the most beautiful anti-war cries ever recorded, a three hanky song!  The two former mentions being more traditional protest lyrics wrapped up in some complex progressive rock structures.  Once you listen to these, you might just want to go ahead and grab hold of the full albums digitally or the very well remastered CDs.
1	This CD is really great, very calming and relaxing. Janet's voice is very soothing and the imagery is wonderful. It will definitely help anyone who has trouble falling asleep!
1	I love you blink 182 never stop rocking, amazon doesn't have a bad mp3 player system either. buy more blink
1	Beautiful album, I love it so much! Really love the cover that I got too!
1	Tame Impala is coming out with some of the best music I've heard in years. I've been more than impressed with every one of their albums. Currents is a departure from their more psychedelic rock roots, but it ventures into dance/electric psychedelia, a genre that Kevin Parker/Tame Impala are basically pioneering.
1	Yo tengo la gran suerte de tener este disco tanto en CD como en LP y es  un tremendo disco! fabuloso! cinco estrellas es  poco para esta obra maestra .Los ochentas fueron increbiles , cuanta buena musica se hizo  en esos aos, en fin vamos a la informacion. Este disco junto con su compaero PUMP IT, el cual se realizo un ao mas tarde, contiene musica del mas alto nivel, el estilo se definiria como una amalgama de  rock, pop , jazz y funky perfectamente ejecutados. Los musicos que participan aqui no hay nada que decir de ellos ya que los nombres hablan por si solos, jeff berlin(bruford,holdsworth,yes) steve smith(journey),T. lavitz(the dixies dregs),Scott Henderson(jean luc ponty),Neal schon(journey),Neil peart(rush),Ronnie Montrose(gama),entre otros ,tengo que decir algo mas?, de hecho este disco  es importantisimo historicamente por las siguientes razones: Es el primer disco en solitario de Jeff Berlin. Es el segundo disco en que aparecio el guitarrista Scott henderson, el primero fue el FABBLES de Jean Luc Ponty. Fue el primer disco con esta formacion de musicos,(Berlin,Henderson,Lavitz,Smith) ,que aqui se hacen llamar VOX HUMANA, los cuales mas tarde en el 1987 grabaron un disco genial bajo el nombre de PLAYERS.Y que yo sepa,es el unico disco en que ha participado Neil Peart aparte de los discos de Rush. Esta joya de la musica fue realizada en 1985 por el fallido y fracasado sello PASSPORT JAZZ y luego fue editado en CD por BELLAPHON en Alemania. La mayoria de las piezas estan ejecutadas por el excelente line -up de PLAYERS y hasta contiene 200,000 PRAYERS autoria de J.Berlin, que luego apareceria en el disco PLAYERS de 1987, tambien en el desaparecido sello PASSPORT JAZZ. Todo aqui es magnifico, no hay nada que sobre ni que falte. Deben tener este disco en su coleccion urgentemente! ,claro que primero tendran que contratar a un detective privado para que lo busque ya que es casi imposible encontrarlo .Hace unos aos, creo que en 1998, se edito en CD una recopilacion llamada CROOSROADS en el sello DENON me parece,la cual contiene el disco PUMP IT completo y este CHAMPION  menos una cancion, (Champion of the world fue eliminada, ignoro por que),seria aconsejable que si no pueden encontrar estos discos por separados compren la recopilacion que si esta disponible. Es una pena muy grande que Jeff Berlin ya no haga musica en este estilo, sus ultimos trabajos son puramente orientados al jazz .
1	Not much more needs to be said about this recording. Unlike some of Elvis' work, this has aged incredibly well and is not just an artifact. Amazing song, amazing production, and a timeless performance with none of the camp of later live renditions. Winner.
1	Always come back to this one particular song at Christmas.  Not particularly religious, but more to remember loved ones that are gone.  Still know where I was the first time I heard it.  That's the test of a memorable song for me.
1	I love Two steps From Hell. This collection puts together a lot of stuff in one place.
1	One of the best drinking songs ever, it seems to go on for an hour . and the quality is good. Each of Billy Joel's songs like this are a rock opera story in their own right but no party or night out at a dive bar would be complete without this song playing.
1	Very underrated CD.  Too bad one of their members passed away a few years ago.
1	I hope that the album is released on vinyl record.
1	Love the music, but the lyrics are beyond inspiration!
1	I have not heard this in so long but found it at Amazon music they have a very large assortment of Christmas songs and very much recommend you to check it out
1	Great sound, Classic songs, great album.  This is a must have for country music fans out there.  Very pleased with it
1	George Strait will always be the King of "real" country music.  I can't wait for the rest of the album.
1	Explicit version not for little kids or for prudish adults. Love the song. Great to sing along with. Worth the money.
1	If you close your eyes you can almost see yourself walking in the forest. It's like being one with nature in your mind.
1	A great song. Adele has created an amazing opening song to one of the vest bond films.
1	Has always been my favorite song! No one has ever come close to singing it the way Bette Midler sings it!
1	What can I say?  Benny Goodman is the king!  I could easily listen to his music every day, all day.
1	The main song edge of tomorrow is the best but others are cool too.
1	There's not much classic rock I like, but this is an exception. Had a music credit so I added it.
1	Hossein Alizadeh is a tremendous performer that I have learned to admire.  My other recordings of him have ensembles, but this time he is without accompaniment.  With no insult to his usual collaborators, the sound of him playing alone is special indeed.  I found it tremendously relaxing, even though he is playing with so much energy.  I love this album.  Do not miss it!
1	Love this song, beautifully done.easy to sing to Dottie West is an awesome singer, brings back great memories, gonna buy more songs.
1	Years ago, I read a brief review of this CD in Uncut magazine and would search for it from time to time. Finally was able to order and receive (as opposed to availability vanish a couple times in the past). Though it came out in 2004, it's my favorite CD of 2012. It's an incredible collection of songs. The first time I played it, the book I was looking through was laid aside and forgotten. I love this album! I must give props to Amazon, in that, several times I have searched for something out of print, out of country, etc. and have learned that you just come back and keep popping that name or title in from time to time and a hit will happen at some point. It paid off this time, big time. And in the words of so many of those commercials: "I am a non-Amazon-paid-or-influenced customer."
1	Fans of folk music of all kinds could find something worth listening to here (I think Musikas fans would particularly like this), but if you are looking for "pure folk," which is to say strictly Klezmer, Japanese music, Flamenco, Mussette, I'm sorry to say you will not find pure renditions here-but rather, a mishmash of all of these things that works. Although throwing Sweedish folk music and Japanese instruments may seem daunting, they really make it work. There is one common thread of connection-Klezmer music is obviously taken in part out of middle eastern musics, and is similar to Gypsy music due to its origins in eastern lands. As Gypsys and Jewish communities travelled through eastern Europe, and came to Spain via North Africa, (look at songs like "Arabu Andaluz" to see some evidence of Flamenco/middle eastern mishmashng.)the music they brought with them helped kick off and styleize Flamenco and that firey eastern European fiddling we all love. This music simply covers all these geographical and ethnic regions all at once. The fiddler in this outfit is a French ethnomusicologist who spent several years in eastern Europe refining his sound by living in Gypsy villages. The result is a group that I hope gains some success, fame and fortune, but not so much that I could not afford them as my wedding band some day. Some favorite tracks: "Bordeas" has a really hot rhythm to it-it's wicked fast, and somehow the band holds it together tightly. "Troll Wedding" has a kind of sorrowful stomp that is pleasureable. Attention Amazon! This just got released on the excellent "Web of Mimicry" label, and more record stores should be carrying this, including yours!
1	Jed's music grabbed me from the first song and led me on a tour of the best power pop/midwest flavor music that I have found.  Strong, mature, lyrics and melodies that stay with you long after your away from the cd player are the hallmark of this band. You will find yourself returning to this cd again and again throughout the years. Shawn Harrington is a truely amazing song writer. Combined with the other members of the band, they manage to create vivid visual imagery without boring you in the process.  Don't get me wrong, this album rocks. but the lyrics keep you returning for more. Just buy it. you won't regret it.  Out of the 50+ I have bought this year, this is the only one that stays in the cd changer.
1	Once upon a time, hip hop told stories of people who were either under represented or not represented at all in popular media.  There were a plethora of excellent urban reporters ranging from Nas to Tupac keeping its audience up to date on what was going on, and a range of voices from angry to comic to salacious.  Somewhere along the way the message and heart of hip hop was overwhelmed by blingizm and the misogynistic drug dealing subculture.  Conscious rappers like Tribe and Talib faded, and the music suffered.  Along comes Deadlee, a truly unique voice in hip hop with the potential to get the whole sound back on track.  An openly out rapper - sometimes called a homo thug - Deadlee tells stories of gay youth, men and women, and their lives, stories not being told that need to be heard.  His songs have range - they can be enraged, sarcastic, compassionate, barbed and horny - and they have opened the door others are walking through.  What elevates this fine record into more than well-intentioned politics  is not only Deadlee's passion and commitment to his message, but the flat-out bangin' West Coast beats and addictive-on-contact lyrics that are at once accessible and repeat-ready.  His voice has soul, fire and heat and cuts through the sometimes dense arrangements to connect directly with the listener.  Remember when hip hop was really about something?  It there's any justice and one day a Hip Hop Hall of Fame is instituted, Deadlee and his hot music will be among the first inductees.  He's that good, and "Assault With A Deadly Weapon" is not to be missed.
1	The best Joe Stump album yet, the shredding just keeps getting cleaner, faster, and more inventive. The song writing pays homage to Ritchie and Yngvie and also lays down some great styles of his own. My favorite is 'The End Approaches', a tour de force of technique, melodic construction and library of ripping licks worth the price of admission on its own. The fade at the end you just want him to keep laying it down forever. 'Pistoleros' is another of my favorite, with strong melodic development mixed with spicy gunfire.
1	A classic from my youth!  I hated it then being just over of 5'.  I saw Christian Performer Bryan Duncan sing it as an intro to a performance at Mobile College (Now the University of Mobile) in the mid 80's.  And I thought of it again as I was driving my antique Renault Twingo I bought a few days ago.  My small stature and small car with a "tiny horn goin' 'Beep, beep, beep,'" triggered many fun memories.  Downloading the song is creating even more with taller wife my 17 year old son who is 5 inches taller than my 5'4+ self.  Life is great with a blessed life, and an ability to laugh.
1	I don'tknow why, but I love this song.
1	It can be dangerous to review a Punch Brothers album on the same day that it comes out, as their music is generally something that improves over repeated listens as additional layers are peeled back and appreciated.  But as an unabashed PB fan, I expected to love this album, and I already do.  The musical range found on it is astounding - from classical-ish to bluegrass to modern pop-ish to even 80s pop-ish.  There is a fine line that bands need to walk between being true to their sound while still being new and fresh.  This album is unmistakeable in its PB sound, yet there is so much new here.  These guys are so talented, and their music is so fresh, that they scratch an itch that nobody else out there can for me.  In terms of so-called "accessibility" of their music, I would put this album on the level of Antifogmatic - not quite as immediately accessible as Who's Feeling Young Now, but more accessible than Punch.  If you're new to PB, I would recommending starting first with Who's Feeling Young Now.  But of course, they're all great in their own way.
1	I'm very picky about Gospel Music. I like things that connect me to God and this CD does just that. Its an awesome worship album. I highly recommend it.
1	If you enjoy Irish music you will like this album. Really nice tunes some old favorites and some I haven't heard before
1	Her best CD yest! And that is saying something. "Wherever is Your Heart", "The Eye" and "Things that I Regret" are the the best three songs on the CD (first three . funny about that?). It's a typical and smart approach to song layout on an album- put your best stuff at the top to draw listeners in. No criticism from me - I think she's great and can do no wrong - I saw Brandi C live at the world famous MSG a few months back and this album performed live is phenomenal. If you have the chance to see her - do it! If you are hesitating about buying this CD? Don't!
1	This was an amazing album by sabaton.  I think it was better then Carolus Rex and Heroes.
1	Love Michael Card's songs. Thank you God for giving him the words to speak to all of us
1	Beautiful words sung by a beautiful voice.
1	Love it! As good as their previous album!
1	loved it! can't wait for more albums!
1	Love Celtic Woman. This is a great album.
1	A phenomenal accomplishment, with all tracks most enjoyable. The banjo accompaniment makes for a unique listening experience. The awards received were well earned.
1	If you were a fan of Young Turks debut album, you will enjoy this experience. Straight up rock n roll. Wish I Couldve Been sounds like a leftover from the Turks era, The Loser is a piano driven ballad that gives Rhett a chance to tell his story, Craving is a solid rocker, all in all. a solid disc! Track it down and buy it! Its really nice to hear the voice that drove Young Turks back in business again!
1	hear this song on Sirrus radio and searched for days and found it here. Great song love makes you want to dance everytime.
1	Very good recording, as good as the cd I use to have
1	I love love love Jordan Smith and this CD is a wonderful addition to my CD collection.  I highly recommend to other fans.
1	Love the new song Flora-Bama! I am prejudiced though because I live close to the world famous roadhouse and because I'm attending Kenny's concert there on August 16th. Can't wait to see the video for the song that he's shooting at the Flora-Bama.
1	Way back when this album was new they played some tracks on WEGL and I had to buy the CD. It has been one of my favorite all-time CDs to listen to over the years. I love Ms. Holder's voice - she easily stands with my other favorites of Suzanne Vega, Sarah McLachlan, a Aimee Mann. My absolute favorite track here is "Blue Moon" - I always imagined the day I could have a child to sing this to and now I do. Thank you, Ms. Holder, for this gift of an album.
1	Jerry's solo is vintage early 70's Jerry. Phil is amazing providing a great counterpoint to Jerry; Bob just keeps it going as does Bill. And Pigpen provides solid vocals. Maybe the best rendition of H2H.
1	I always loved this song. My five year old loves it even more. He loves it because it is in the new Muppet movie. So it's a track we both enjoy.
1	Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.  If you haven't yet purchased PRAY'R. don't wait any longer. it's destined to be a mega-hit!
1	And great they are. Grew up listening to this music although it was not the music of my generation but that of my older siblings. Loved it then, love it now.
1	Oh hallelujah to the King of kings and the Lord or lords!
1	I've always loved George Benson. Not only from his records but in concert for many years. When I heard the frist Norman Brown CD I thought this guy if the Future MR. Benson. His style,his music create the smooth sounds that I enjoy. I have to say, I have every CD he's brought out. This current CD will not let you down, take it from a smooth jazz lover from down under.
1	Great New Wave song from my days working at a nightclub in the city
1	I love this song so much. It is a great workout song. It helps me by pumping me up to finish my workout.
1	WOW!  AWESOME!  GLORY!  If you want to bask in the Shekanah Glory Light of the Lord just put on this CD and close your eyes.  Miracle Maker is my all time favorite worship song.  Kim has a unique voice that sinks into your soul right along with the music.  You cannot listen to this CD and not feel God at work in your soul!  Praise God for music like this that takes us into His Presence.  We use these songs frequently at the end of our Bible study for a time at the Feet of Jesus and let me tell you we have each experienced the power and wonder of God.
1	We heard this music performed live on our first trip to Hawaii eleven years ago and everytime we hear it, it takes us right back to Maui. It is not traditional Hawaiian music but it still feels like Hawaii, you can hear the Ocean and feel the Hawaiian breezes in every note. We LOVE it!
1	love songs are kool. But what happened to Saturday In The Park now that is a lovely song. must remember this cd is 2005.
1	Claus Larsen's 'Legacy of Hate & Lust' album is quite good. I have often seen him as the Trent Reznor of the Euro scene- and with good reason! No only does Larsen's skill in composition run parallel to Reznor's, but Leather Strip manages to capture more of the early underground darkwave vibe (maybe that's because Larsen has been around longer than Reznor). Had Reznor written "Down There With You", it would have received ceaseless air time. but as it stands, Leather Strip is destined to be a non-commercial entity. 'Legacy of Hate & Lust' is heavily dependent on synthesizers (more so than NIN)- and that is mainly what the pieces are comprised of. The songs tend to be well written and portray emotion through the use of different sonic soundscapes. Highlight here are the classics "Down There With You", "I Won't Look Back", and "No Rest for the Wicked". Definitely a very good CD that unfortunately falls short of perfection. Fans of Nine Inch Nails and Soul Scythe should give Leather Strip a listen without hesitation.
1	I love the Beach Boys! Their Christmas album is fantastic. I feel like a teenager again.
1	Never preordained an album before. I don't  usually buy albums at all, much less listen an album over and over, but I  have with this one.
1	The sound is clear as if was just released. Takes me back!
1	Love it even more than I did growing up! Great song!
1	I love this song its very touching and moving i like the way it sound every clear it sounds like a CD.
1	This collection is very soothing. I listen to music while I sleep, and this is great! Great price too! Thanks Amazon!
1	One of the best albums I've heard.  Sure beats anything The Bieber puts out! It's fun, it's interesting, it's creative and well performed, great production. Five Stars easy.
1	I'm probably really dating myself here, but Judy Collins is, has been and probably always will be one of my top five singer-songwriters. Her voice casts a spell over those who listen: crystal clear, strong, resonant, and just plain beautiful. And this song, done so well by her, is among my top 10 favorite romantic ballads. If you like Judy Collins, you'll truly relish this song.
1	I love this song!  This, like any form of art, is entirely a matter of taste.  If you like similar kinds of music, I would expect you'll like this song, too, and I would therefore highly recommend you download it without hesitation.  If you do not like this genre of music, or songs with similar musical elements, then I would expect you will not like this particular song, and therefore cannot recommend it.  There's no accounting for taste, and for that reason, it's idiotic to give a 'product rating' to a song, or other art form.  It would be like me rating a color.  I like blue.  I recommend blue.  Blue is good.  If you don't like blue, then you probably shouldn't buy things that are blue, whether or not you see a 5-star rating on Amazon.
1	Hurricane is an amazing song by a wonderful artist! Love her passion for music! I would highly recommend this song.
1	LOVE George Strait. i mean whats not to love. this is by far one of our favorite cds. we love listening to it on road trips or while dancing around the house.
1	Great music, great band.  I love hearing my little country boys singing this around the house - it plays constantly.  I love that we were able to get the CD for $2 more when we were just going to get the MP3.  Great deal.
1	I love this song - I was singing it when I left the theater after watching the movie Frozen, and it stuck with me so that I wanted to buy it to listen on its own. Idina Menzel has a beautiful voice, and the strength and power of her vocals carry this song. Plus, how many songs can incorporate the phrase "frozen fractals" and get away with it? The lyrics might be more meaningful to people who watched the movie, but I feel like they could be relevant outside that context too. For me, though, I just picture the beauty of the winter wonderland in that movie when I hear this song.
1	Love Amazon's music download one click and the song you love is yours. No point in buying cds these days, but the artists should still make money.
1	I'm not the biggest Beyonce fan but I love this song! The beat is crazy! I have no clue what partition means though lol
1	I've been a fan of Jeff Healey for years - back in the 80s when he was playing for free He was an incredible player - touch, tone, soul This CD captures one of the later iterations of his blues band (rhythm guitar and keys) on a particular hot night It's not perfect - no overdubs, but it is wonderful Blues fans rejoice  jb
1	Home Free is amazing as usual! How can you lose with a legend like Kenny Rogers.
1	Soulful, longing, wanting, anger, frustration, etc. one of the world's best songs ever.
1	Ever since I heard this song, I've been entranced by it.  Is it THAT good?  I dunno. I don't care; it's at least VERY good, in my opinion.  I recognize that just because I like something doesn't mean it's all that good; doesn't matter, I'm a low-brow, so shoot me already.  Without even knowing the lyrics, or caring about them, I loved the feeling the song gave me.  For the longest time, I thought the song was "Alia" or "Aliyah".
1	Great album. Good mix of new songs, a cover and old gems transformed anew. Backslider, Belly of the Whale, Possum Kingdom, Dollskin, Heart of Glass and Jigsaw Girl are particular standouts.
1	Great song with an easy listening track- the words are powerful words about trusting God!  Terrific price too through Amazon!
1	shipping was fast cd was new and unopened as stated thank you very much
1	Changed my life in the 70's. Will be sung at my transition to Heaven.
1	You can't forget the movie when you hear the theme.
1	Great song loved it, very soothing to hear. Loved to listen to this song while cooking in the kitchen. Very inspirational.
1	I love Alan Jackson.  Especially love "Where Were You, When the World stopped turning?"  A great record.  Seller was completely satisfactory.  CD in excellent condition. I,m very satisfied.
1	High quality album better my iTunes version. Awesome album listening to it everyday. Highly recommend!
1	Such a sexy song and I listen to it every time I want to feel good
1	I've rarely heard Ms Anderson so angry.  Brava!  We NEED a dose of angry right now.  With the recent revelations about America holding its own citizens to Secret Laws as interperpreted in Secret rulings by a Secret Court, and its widespread spying on everybody, and throwing away international goodwill on stupid wars and drone strikes, .  Well, let's just say that angry is exactly where we ought to be.  She manages it without screaming at people, which is good.  I never liked screamy music.  But she's asking questions that desperately need to be asked, and demanding answers that we desperately need to find our own voice to demand.
1	Just a good ol fun high energy song from these newer country stars!
1	The music on this album is beautiful and haunting.  I tracked down the movie simply to put it all in context.  A truly talent violinist.
1	It is very good recorded, is remastered, sound great, I, recomended to music lover and those who likes the Beatles.
1	This album is dope from start to end, Cole wants that #1 spot and I think he has it!
1	Henry Mancini is a genius. When ever I feel down ,or a friend is sad, or a child is grumpy I play the baby elephant walk. It always gets a smile. Peter Gunn, the pink panther these are all just good music.
1	grudging acceptance emerging, sort of.
1	Lyrics. um right. Music is great, solid riffs and quick solo
1	I grew up in western North Carolina (Appalachian Mountains) so Mark O'Connor's music is quite familiar.  However, this arrangement of Appalachian Waltz is 10x times better than any I have heard.  My daughter and I both love it.
1	A truly great movie with an awesome soundtrack and with Amazon, a great price as well.
1	I heard this again on an '80's station and had to buy the MP3.  I was not disappointed.  I've listened to it so many times.  Makes me want to dance.
1	This album is great for preschoolers!  I taught at the same school as Bill Gordh for 6 years and my former preschool students LOVED going to his storytelling classes.  I remember when this album came out and now that I have a toddler of my own, I had to have a copy!  Kudos to Bill who is INCREDIBLY talented!  I recommend this album to every parent!
1	Track still relevant in any dance club
1	This was a surprise gift to my Christian-music loving parents and Lauren Daigle does not disappoint. This is a great CD!
1	Honestly, this was my only "opera" recording on 8-track.  So surprised at the price point, as even then this was a compilation.  T is great, even sublime!  I loved every minute of the recording.  But every 8 minutes or whatever it was I heard the hard metalic clickk of "CHANGING TRACKS'  $69!  "Changing Tracks"  Honestly, it was a great recording.  And it deserves BETTER!  Btw - duh! - had a palette load of opera recordings on LP.  MR TAPE WHERE ARE YOU!
1	Not disappointed. Easy listening. Highly recommend.
1	BEST SONG EVER - My ten year old son.  Yeah, it was pretty good. - Me
1	I got to see Lauren in concert the end of March and was awe struck by everything about her. Shes got a great sense of humor and was really fun being around. Her voice is just amazing!  I never bought her album on Amazon but I did preorder her album and I bought a couple locally.  I recommend anyone to hear this young lady sing!  You won't be dissapointed.
1	Loved this song back in the day. I wish the recording quality was better, but I bought it anyway because it helped me remember a friend who recently passed away.
1	This is a great record, not too mainstream, not too experimental, it contains all Xtina's styles in one. Its not only for Christina lovers, I truly recomend this album for everyone.
1	A very nice set of the same music you would be hearing at the games. Well done.
1	Love the tune but when I read the lyrics . mind blow.
1	Fly from Here really surprised me on its ability to gravitate from the Classic Yes sound that Yes fans have loved for decades and a more modern edginess.  The lyrics and imagery that resonates from the new CD is pure and thoroughly enjoyable.  Whether you're a long time fan or just a newer Yes fan, this CD is definitely worth a listen.
1	I've listened to it a million time. Not tired of it yet. I would that that that's a good sign.
1	I got to meet this Man of God, his wife and traveling Church group, they have the anointing that changes the atmosphere.
1	Classic Sheryl Crow, great song to listen to on rainy days. Loved it since I first heard this song, back in the day.
1	This is my favorite Barry song!  There are so many wonderful songs but I love this one! Listen to it and enjoy.
1	Exactly what I wanted, sounds of the surf and nothing else.
1	This is a fantastic CD by Jennifer Nettles and Sugarland.  One of their best.  This is my second copy.  My original became scratched but the album was so fantastic that I felt it worth buying another copy as I never get tired of listening to it.
1	The musical is amazing to see in person, and barring being able to see it again, the soundtrack is the next best thing!  Amazing, amazing soundtrack, everyone must get!
1	I love these two artist & for a father & son to collaborate is beautiful. This is a playlist song
1	Saw the you tube video a long time ago, loved that version of the song.  Since I didn't want to search you tube every time I wanted to listen, I downloaded this mp3.  It's a pretty good version. I like how the guys kind of laugh at the beginning, and I like that the crowd sings along.  The phrasing isn't quite as crisp as the you tube version, but I still like it and am glad I bought it.
1	I remember this song from my childhood. It sounds exactly as it did back then. It brings back so many memories and you can't help but sing along. Get your copy now!
1	I have been a casual fan of nonpoint since the first album. But this album is next level! The vocals are heavy and soulful at the same time! not to mention is groovy as hell I love it!
1	I WANT TO BE FILLED UP BY THE LORD I LOVE THIS SONG
1	Speed Sleep has truly revolutionized my life.  I have always believed that getting the proper amount of sleep is important for optimal function-I can feel myself dragging if I don't get a full night's sleep.  But, realistically, I can rarely sleep 8 hours a night.  So, I would find myself wanting a nap a few times a week.  But, inevitably, I would sleep for hours and still get up feeling groggy and unrested. I was definitely skeptical when I first tried Speed Sleep-I find a choir of trumpets would be inadequate in rousing me from my naps.  But, it's truly amazing!  Each time I use it, I fall asleep faster and each time I am delighted when I find myself awake and recharged at the end of the 25 minutes. In the few weeks I've used Speed Sleep, I've not only saved hours of nap time but also become more productive in my increased waking hours.  I would strongly recommend this CD.  If you're busy with work or school, Speed Sleep is a great tool to revitalize quickly and increase your efficiency.
1	Love this band and the music. It is disappointing that they are not as well known as they deserve to be. Package came carefully wrapped.
1	This is a great collection of new wave jazz from him. One of the greatest. It is a classic. It's raw and contemporary.  His piano skills are amazing Get this one you won't be disappointed
1	I've always loved this song. I heard another's rendition on The Voice this week, and bought it. Then I decided to buy this one too.
1	High energy classic album. One of my go-to's for fun or driving!
1	I like to play this song loud for my neighbors. Fortunately, I live in a neighborhood where no one speaks English.
1	that sounds really kinky :- ) . the actual title is supposed to be "Baby,You Look Good TO Me Tonight"
1	This song can bring a very long bad day to a great outlook for tomorrows awesome day. Flat out moving!
1	A Mahler symphony performed by high school students? Hard to believe. A Mahler symphony performed with sure technical command and idiomatic fluency by high school students? Unbelievable. But one listen to this live recording by Rudolf Barshai and the Junge Deutsche Philharmonie, and you'll become a believer. While Barshai is probably best known as a Shostakovich conductor (he premiered the composer's Fourteenth Symphony in 1969), on the evidence of this CD he's a natural Mahlerian as well. Arguably the most difficult of Mahler's symphonies to put over convincingly, the Fifth here is a model of architectural strength and contrapuntal clarity, which flows beautifully and even effortlessly. Barshai refuses to indulge in self-conscious phrasing or sensational effects, yet the climaxes are as shattering as the composer would want, while the sinuous (and sinewy) Adagietto comes off as the love song to future-wife Alma that Mahler intended. This is something very special; the same recording is also available on Brilliant Classics coupled with Barshai's own orchestration of the unfinished Tenth Symphony.
1	Oh my, you don't have to be a male to relate to this song. I love it, gives me an excuse to. do nothing!
1	Critics have called this the best soul album ever. They're right. This is the best non-greatest hits soul album one can buy. Outstanding singing, precision producing make this a can't miss album. The album looks like a  greatest hit package with "Ghetto Child," "One of a Kind  Love Affair," "How Could I Let You Get Away," "I'll be  Around" and others. The first track, "Just Can't Get You out of  My Mind" gets you going and you won't be able to turn it off.
1	AMAZING! I love every song. The only song not on there that I missed was "Bad Girl".
1	as with most of his music Wings is beautiful and relaxing them - I have several of his albums and enjoy them all
1	the best grunge album of all time! reminds me of Nirvana's stint in the no. 1 of the billboard chart for weeks!
1	an awesome song by Mr McCall, he does an awesome job of singing and thank you amazon for downloading into my computer, the best way to buy!
1	Great song.  I love the rock vibe and rawness of the lead singers voice.
1	This is another excellent tribute cd by Jeff Sato, Japanese electric guitar master of 60's British rock sounds. Fans of great British rock guitarists will appreciate this always interesting selection of acoustic and electric versions of Beatles tunes by Jeff and his friends including Pete Brown, who wrote most of the lyrics for the Cream's Disraeli Gears album. Jeff has also produced excellent tribute cds to the music of Brian Jones, George Harrison, Cream.and Clapton Tribute cds in general would be more popular if they were all done with this level of care and craft.
1	This song helps me to be calm and focus on Jesus when life is stressful and I need to prioritize.
1	I have been a loyal JMT fan for 10 years now.  A very small amount of time considering how long he has been in the Music Business.  And I have collected all 30 or more studio albums he has conceived in his 30 plus years. From his Mason Proffit Years rubbing shoulders with the likes of Janis Joplin and many other great singers and bands from the late 60's and early 70's.  JMT is far from his roots. You will find this collection a mere  drop in a bucket compared to his complete library, but more than likely, not everyone reading this will find themselves owning his complete library.  But this is a great start.  This I think is a perfect start!  It has most all of My personal Favorite songs like."Lilies of the Field"."Healer of my Soul"."Hiding Place"."The Pleiades and Oriion". and "Sunrise". I am not Catholic, but I don't believe JMT is directing his efforts strickly toward one denomination. This music is a celebration of Jesus Christ. it sooths the spririt and allows your life to slow down and realise there is so much more and different to music and the Spirit in which you take it all in. You will find his music has a touch of Brilliance to each song. His Guitar picking is something to be awed at. The String arrangements heard on many of these songs are full and breathtaking and sensative to your heart. His Voice is something I imagine God Himself enjoying from Heaven. Above all. I cannot get enough of John Micheal Talbot and look foward to each new release.
1	Great sounding remaster of a heartfelt song. This is pretty much the only Human League song I like enough to purchase.
1	This is so inspirational. I loved watching these guys on Mike Huckabee show on FNC one Saturday night. The lead singer is just outstanding. I love their songs, and can't wait to see the movie.
1	i listened to this album over and over again when i first bought it around 1980. i am a huge fan of traffic and basically anything to do with steve winwood. i hadn't heard it in years and just recently picked it up again . it may not be steves finest moment but it's still a good album. it does sound abit 80ish but that's not really a bad thing considering whats out there thats new. i'd never pay full price for it but given the chance to pick it up for 12bucks like i did well it's a worth while buy.
1	I was always the girl who did what I wanted and was never gonna fall in love. I met my husband and like the song says he made me want to dress like a girl.
1	Surprised to hear these classic songs interpretted by Dylan, but he and the musicians did a great job.  Pretty mellow collection.
1	This song starts out simple enough - it floats along, is pleasant enough, fades nearly away and then - then, a couple of power chords and drums announce the thunder, and David brings it down. He launches into what I think is one of the great guitar solos in Rock. It's not fast, it's not complicated, but it tells a story - what can I say? It's great! Maybe you won't agree, I don't know, but this sounds like the work of a Master, at the peak of his powers. I never grow tired of it. Not yet. And I hope not ever.
1	The epic song for any girl who loves her men but also loves her 80's music!  A must have for your collection!
1	very relaxing.  You put this cd on when you are with the right persson.
1	I DIDN"T LIKE THE FACT THAT I COULD ONLY GET IT DIDGITALLY, BUT AM VERY HAPPY TO HAVE IT. I HAVE SEARCHED FOR A LONG TIME FOR IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HELPING ME LOCATE IT.
1	I'm a woman and this is a great song that I can't stop singing.  GREAT JOB. I thank God for REAL singing without that machine sound. AWESOME!
1	I lost track of my LP Album Back Stabbers back in the day.  This song is only one of my most favorite on the album.
1	I can imagine a younger listener first coming to these performances being almost shocked or scandalised by Richter's no-holds-barred-take-no prisoners manner -especially one brought up to consider the refined and understated style of pianists such as Brendel as the apogee of Beethovian interpretation. Richter attacks the keyboard and at times bangs the heck out of fit to wake the blue-rinse set and delight the shade of LVB himself. Not that he is incapable of filigree delicacy and not that he ever sounds clattery; there is a special sonority about Richter's playing that suggests not a row of black and white keys but an army of musicians at his fingertips; Richter doesn't play, he orchestrates a sonata in big, luscious, polychromatic waves of sound; it is quite phenomenal. It helps that the sound of this bargain Regis issue - re-mastered from the Olympia discs of 1971 and 1975 but originally issued by Melodiya, then EMI - is so appealing: big and rich, quite close without feeling as though your head is trapped under the piano hood. Nor is the singing quality of this music ever neglected; Beethoven as Romantic melodist as well as revolutionary is given his due and as the last bars fade you find yourself humming the refrain of that delightful, insouciant, rippling motif that opens the "Non troppo presto e molto cantabile" of Op. 90. "Cantabile" is always foremost in this last work; despite being a much later composition from 1814, it inhabits a different world from the sonatas of 1795. Surprisingly, it is the Beethoven of twenty-five who is all Olympian grandeur and sombre reflection - at least, the way Richter interprets those first two sonatas - the later work has a kind of singing, Schubertian melancholy that smiles bravely through tears. The magnificence and dignity of Richter's playing in the Adagio of the Third Sonata is a monument to his formidable pianistic technique and profound artistic sensibility; contrast it with the ineffable sweetness of, again, that last movement in No. 27.  This a disc that should be in everybody's collection - and at Regis' prices, it can be.
1	I'm usually not huge into live albums.  I just like the perfection of a studio album.  But these guys certainly know how to play a live show.  Some really nice mix-ups and they really play well into a live audience.  Definitely recommend this if you like Daft Punk.
1	An instant classic! A textured, flowing, living, breathing piece of work. At times skeletal and at others lush, but never less than completely absorbing. Live, the songs are much more loud and intense. Evan Dickson really knows his way around a song, not just melody and chords, but entire worlds seem to be at his disposal. Equally as good, if not better than the new Spoon record.  I'm really looking forward to the new ep as well. I can't say enough nice things about this band.
1	Beautiful piece of music! Listening to Jila is refreshing. I wish Amazon would sell books for its music notes as well
1	Ry has always been an incredible musician.  Here he uses politics as his focus.  This is a unique take on 2012 politics. The lyrics are hilarious, but hold true.  We just had the RNC nearby and many lines rang true.  Except for the stuff about Palin. I think Fox faux-news and the RNC excluded her. The closeted RNC kept the male and female prostitutes busy and the prostitutes sent them back home with some special presents. The lyrics are funny but true and are well written.  The underlying music is the best of Mr Cooder.  Could have been from many of the 70s best albums. There are several more detailed reviews here on Amazon so I recommend shoppers read several reviews (most are sterling).  A few of the right wing nuts who apparently don't like enlightened musicians. For those few right wingers Amazon offers burned out, failed musicians like Hank Williams Jr or Ted (the bird) Nugent. those idiots should offer you more  music to meet your needs (not good music, but right wing) . As for one of the icons of music in the age of old baby-boomers, Ry is great as always. Don't like ry?  Strap your dog on the roof of your Bentley and head for west Texas but don't listen to Willy Nelson, don't listen to a Hispanic, don't listen to a black person or any band from Austin (you might be listening to someone who reads and thinks). please make sure and stick with the grunts of Bosephus.
1	My father, God rest his soul, was an aficionado of jazz.  I guess this was because he was originally from Louisiana and was very familiar with New Orleans style Dixieland jazz.  Whatever the reason, some of his tastes in music rubbed of on me, and I still love to listen to the older stuff.  Pee Wee Hunt was one of the folks my Dad liked to listen to, and I've always loved his version of 12th Street Rag.  Well, it's here on this disk&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/12th-Street-Rag/dp/B000MK2WT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">12th Street Rag</a>&nbsp;and it's still and Oldie but Goldie, folks.  This disk is a great overview of 30s and 40s jazz and swing.  There are a lot of very catchy version of the oldies on this disk, so as far as I'm concerned (and I'll bet my Dad is, too), this CD is well worth it and would be a great addition to anyone's library of music.
1	A song that might help a struggling person. It helps bridge that gap we sometimes have if God is with me.
1	I really loved these two artists as a duet. It's nice they got together again.  I really loved the lyrics!
1	This is one of those songs that sort of gets stuck in your head. This is one of the First times when a song hit was not only mostly instrumental, but also mostly electronic. There have been many Great Instrumental songs, both before and since, (including the vast body of classical music)- But Electronic instruments were mostly relegated to SciFi Film scores and very few of them got radio play. In fact, It may have been none. Telstar broke through the radio hit/sales barrier with an early electronic keyboard and processed tape technique. It would not be untill W. Carlos came out with switched on Bach Several years later that any other hit would be so electronic. This is a must peice of music for any who appreciate contemporary music history.
1	One of my favorite childhood albums.  I WANT this music back!  Please release on CD!
1	This song is fantastic!  Emeil's voice is heavenly to listen to.  I have this song saved to my desk top so I can listen to it over and over again.
1	Its been working good. its very relaxing to see and hear. its great
1	This couple's first album is very well done.  The songs are all original- at least I have never heard them before.  Their harmonies are music to my ears.  The arrangements of each song are unique and also music to my ears.  The lyrics are different and meaningful.  This album will be one of my favorite and I hope the couple stays together making more great tunes.
1	This is the kind of thing you might find in your local supermarket next to Jim Reeves's Greatest Hits or 20 Traditional Irish Jigs.  After Shaft's hypnotic 'Mucho Mambo Sway', however, I thought I'd give it a go, though dreading, from the cover, slabs of anaemic, 80s, synthesised gloop, a caricature of a potent and hysterical dance form. On the contrary, this is a fantastic introduction to the mambo in many of its forms, from 'Mambo de la Luz', which replicates the spirit of the old Henry Mancinci 'Touch of Evil' theme, all squalling horns and sinister tribal rhythms; to the more Fox musical stomp of 'Mambo Paradiso'; taking in the sand-blown Mexican melancholy of, er, 'Serenata Mexicana', and the soundtrack-to-a-thousand-ads, Perez Prado's 'Patricia'. In almost every case, the easy, superficial option is avoided; the predominantly dance thrills supplemented by heartstopping piano breaks, swirlingly sad trumpet crescedos, or feverish changes in tempo, adding soul to the sass.  This is a CD to soundtrack the movies in your head: for all its bright dance frenzy, however, it always seems to work best with noir.
1	I love epic soundtrack pieces, especially when the music is a part of a heroic movie. This fits that description completely. Not as heavy as the music from the Nolan Batman films, which I prefer, but it is still awesome and sometimes a much-needed change-up from those heavy percussion drums.
1	Both soundtrack and movie are awesome
1	This song has a rhythm and a melody that's unusually interesting.  The lyrics are unique as well.  I was in a relationship like this one, and it's amazing how this song pinpoints the feelings I had.
1	What a great piece of work. The whole concept. the breathtaking vocals and brilliant arrangements make this work on par or greater than Emma Shapplin's Carmine Meo. I am obsessed with this disc and I will be for a very long time.
1	I love all of the Patriotic music on this CD.  Highly recomended to all with similar interests.  Not for the Occupy Wall Street Crowd.
1	I was very pleased with this cd and would suggest this to friends. Worth listening to over and over. .
1	Not sure how to review a masterpiece
1	One of songwriter Jimmy Webb's better tunes, on what I believe was Art Garfunkel's first solo effort (when he and Paul Simon first went their separate ways).  I think the arrangement builds off what Garfunkel had done with Simon on "Bridge Over Troubled Water", as their is some similarity in the orchestration and all.  But it is still just a drop dead, beautiful song, and Garfunkel's voice is pristine perfect.
1	This is one of my favorite songs by Stevie Wonder. if you know the lyrics to the song, it just makes you fall in love with Stevie.  His harmonica part is one of the best parts of this track.  Thank you for an awesome song Mr. Stevie Wonder!
1	. but, I feel like this is a really solid album.  I can't stand most rap, and even some of Lil Wayne's earlier material I don't like.  This album however I thought was very well constructed.  Most of the beats are great, while his words (for the most part) are smart too.  I can't stand the single "A Milli" though.  The flow is great, but the tracking of "a milli a milli a milli a milli." is just annoying.  But again, I'm not an expert.  Listen to the critics - album of the year.  This product gets 4 stars because some of the tracks could be a littler better, AND because I was foolish enough to not look and see that this is only half the album.  I suppose the other 8 tracks will be released eventually on LP. Le sigh.
1	My all time favorite C.D and this song is the s*. Snoop came hard with this song.
1	Love the music and lyrics.  It has a great beat.  Love to just sit and listen to this song.  But you can dance to it as well .  This song takes you to a place you were once at in a relationship.  Songs are your feelings written to melody.
1	Title song is great, I'll be order more off of the Mem Shannon CD's. I recommend this song and others to anybody that likes the blues.
1	While I wouldn't be likely to choose Dave Edmunds as my favorite performer, I have clearly decided that THIS is my favorite type of music hands-down.  It is so unprocessed, so catchy and fun it is truly irresistible to me.
1	This is one of those laid back musicals that you hear in commercials or in movies or even on the radio but you can't quite place it.  I stumbled apon this one while sampling this album.  Glad I did.
1	I am in love with this song. The various layers of it & melodies that it contains are powerful & perfect. I'm so happy to rediscover this song after a long time of not knowing what it was. It's just a great, classic song.
1	First off, love the Eagles! All their songs. Funny that when this song was written it was appropriate for the times, at least for me, and like every thing in this world, it comes back around.
1	Great selection. I like the 1964 and 1966 and mid sixties of this series the best personally. but they're all nice to listen to!. cr/lasvegas
1	Adam Young's music is like a music to a soul. Definitely must haves to both fans and starting to love his owlsomeness :)  Cheers from the Philippines
1	B.W. Stevenson turned out a Best Effort with this track. Unfortunately we lost him at 38 so his talent shone only shortly. This is a great example of his talent.
1	Possibly the best song ever written by any musician in the world.
1	On a trip I was taking, I heard "Carefree Highway" on the radio, and instantly loved it.  When I got back, I looked up the artist, and I can say I'm loving Gordon's music.
1	I LOVE THIS SONG. I HEARD IT AND LIKED IT ON THE RADIO.
1	This song is the best song of the year, I cant wait for the cd to come out, I love this song, it makes you belive that your hope and dreams will come true, it makes you feel good to b and a relationship. I cant wait to hear more from this brother.
1	The wait was well worth it. What Flyleaf has released to us is wonderful. On top of that for being Amazon customers we get the exclusive Mp3 version of the album. Thank-you Amazon and thank-you Flyleaf.  This album was worth the money spent. The songs on it are new and there are many. The music is slightly different than their previous album, but still has that Flyleaf touch to it.  I think if your a fan of the first album you will enjoy their second release, Memento Mori.
1	I've been a fan of Tiffany since her debut cd, which i am proud to say i still own. Her debut cd was recorded when she was only 14, and for that age i found Tiffany's vocals to be amazing. Some people criticized her for sounding nasal, but she has a raspy character to her voice that shines on her ballads. Her ballads are her strongest numbers, and altogether her voice is more suited to ballads than songs like "I Saw Him Standing There", which is borderline cheesy. The song "Mr. Mambo" is a piece of garbage that totally ruined a cd that i almost rated five stars. Why she even chose to record that song is beyond me. I seriously doubt that Tiffany even wanted to do that song in the first place. Probably industry pressure made her sing it. Tiffany all but disappeared from the music scene through almost all of the 90s, but happily returned in the new millenium with a new career and an amazing cd that just blew everyone away that had written her off as a washup. Her new cd The Color Of Silence is nothing short of perfect. The critics gave it great reviews, and Tiffany showed everyone that she is a true talent with a great voice. Working with some of the best producers and song-writers in the business, Tiffany's The Color Of Silence is a not-to-be-missed cd. Unfortunately, it got little radio play, but for those who search it out it's a classic. Her new style and acoustic sound is being compaired to Alanis Morrissette, but personally i think Tiffany is head-and-shoulders above Alanis and has much more class. Tiffany, i'm glad to see you're back on the music scene. Your voice and talent was too strong to go into retirement. Welcome back!
1	Lenny White is the legendary drummer from the awesome jazz rock fusion band Return To Forever and this is his new solo album filled with an eclectic collection of songs showcasing both his talent and that of his group of awesome musicians. The album opens up with "Drum Boogie" which has an intense groove and awesome syncopated drumming. This song sets a high standard and leads nicely into the heavy riff of "We Know" with some great fills and a nice melody on top. From here the album goes all over the place in musical styles with songs like "Coming Down" which has a Prince vibe, the funky and soulful "Forever", and the progressive groove of "Gazelle" and "Election Day". Only two songs have vocals so this is definitely one for the instrumental fans. I enjoyed the way the album was very progressive and technical yet still musical with nice catchy grooves and melodies. The crisp production and excellent mixing is also a highlight. A very solid album overall and highly recommended to fans of quality modern fusion like CAB and of course Return To Forever.
1	Wonderful song, Adele has an amazing voice that never disappoints!
1	Catchy song. Cannot wait for the movie.
1	Original songs from the rides and attractions. Wonderful!
1	This chick is so cool. so honest and forthright.  Doesn't give a f*.  Not to mention talented!  A very killer voice. so full of velvet.  She is the Guns N' Roses of soul music!  Not just 'blue eyed soul', she's the real deal!  Get her stuff. nuff said
1	This song is as beautiful as it was when I first heard it. It leaves me an emotional mess every time, but in a good way. Roberta Flack can't be out done.
1	Great old song.  It's nice to have the opportunity to find the classic rock songs and download them.  Great quality.  Thanks.
1	Excellent Hard to Handle and Smokestack Lightning electric.  Acoustic (including Wake Up Little Susie!) songs are fun if not exemplary musicianship as Reckoning was from later 1980. Excellent album for Pigpen fans!  Not an album of long powerful improvisation, but illustrates the authentic American influences that bred this unique band.  2nd best acoustic recordings of Dead after Reckoning.  From the same 2/1970 shows that are on DP #4. which is 10 stars!
1	I am a Counting Crows fan so I'm biased.  This album is solid though.  I like Hard Candy better but this has a similar feel.  Even more upbeat in terms of tunes though.  Still distinctly Counting Crows.  Order I prefer my albums is now (so very subjective):  Hard Candy This Desert Life August and Everything After Somewhere Under Wonderland Underwater Sunshine Films about Ghosts (debated including this since it's a compilation with only two new songs) Recovering the Satellites Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings.
1	A great oldie! I love the story behind it.  There was a Canadian Native American tribe where the male population outnumbered the female. So the men who didn't have women turned to a type of wine called Crackling Ros as their "date" for the evening.
1	This is a terrific set of songs for Re-Working.  I like them all.  And the enthusiasm Van gives to each of them is fun to listen to.  The selections of partners is a real trip back and the pairings with the songs precise all the way.  I imagine it will be a reach for some fans to recognize who some of them are, unless they get some packaging notes.  I didn't, I got the mp3s, so do some searches on the artists to find out or remind yourself.  You won' t understand how really treasured this collection is, if you don't.  Not that you will need to, but do it anyway if you want to enjoy it more.  And, you may be surprised by:  Van's talented daughter. rich voice, timing, Rough God is a huge recycle.  Clare Teal on Carry A Torch was newer to me and made me go looking for more music from her.  I found a LOT to like.  Eternal Kansas City with Gregory Porter brought me to still more digging up of diamonds.  The music pairings are so right to the partner's style, it is hard to believe (Knopfler on Irish Heartbeat, Joss Stone on Wild Honey).  On (Needed Someone):  Man, this tune with Mavis Staples, what a match. great, great duet, so nice.  Just buy this.  No way you won't find a bunch of things to like.  And, don't forget to read up on these legends, you will get a lot more out of the "Re-work".  The huge effort, in so many ways, Van put into this set of treasures. it's brilliant.
1	This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul. It keeps whispering in my ear, "go on, go over, you can do it. Just a little longer." This song eclipses all other works of music, nay works of art in the world today! Beethoven would be proud, but he's dead. Keep on Gangnam, keep on!
1	This is one of my favorite coast to coast am songs it suits it very well while listening to one of my favorite radio shows
1	even the other black dice albums aren't like this. this is such a good album. its nature and noise and new age and metal and brilliance.
1	The best song Shaggy does, in my opinion.
