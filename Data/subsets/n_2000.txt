0	I got this for a playlist I had to make.  Not my cup of tea
0	I'm not feeling all the GDs, so its not my favorite
0	Were it not for the Hell Yeah CD by Black 'N Blue that I purchased at the same time as Rockaholic, I would criticize this more but after listening to how a terrible a CD can actually be, I will say that at least I didn't frisbee this into the trash. Instead, I kep the case and dropped the CD in the trash.
0	This is completely fake. I am an audio engineer and I was Intrigued by the promotional video I saw on Facebook for this CD. The claim is that crickets are singing a melody. We are played a recording of crickets and then a slowed down version. I took this original and slowed it down to make a comparison. Guess what? There is no melody in the original. I have no objection to making melodies from recordings of crickets, thats an interesting thing to do. Claiming this is some god given natural phenomenon however, is complete nonsense, designed to trick people into buying something. Dont be fooled!
0	Short and sweet:  Without the middle extended instrumental, this is just about as unsatisfying as it gets. Avoid this and find the ALBUM cut, not the "radio" cut, which this is.
0	I want to consider buying this BUT I don't know what it contains! I'm not paying $42 dollars plus s/h without knowing what songs I'm gonna get
0	Sorry as a longtime fan of Chicago Transit Authority's first album, which I think is a classic, I don't understand why they would release this rerecording. All it took was the soundbite of 25 or 6 to 4 to realize that it sounds very flat and dull and nothing like the original version. Will skip this and go listen to the original LP's on vinyl to get the full sound that these great songs were meant to have. Warning don't buy this imitation, seek out the original vinyl LP's to get the full effect.
0	These are re-recorded versions and, of course, the excitement and energy is completely gone in these songs. Sometimes it's just best to leave original art alone. These are horrible and not worth the money. Get the originals and feel the energy, the art, the passion and the excitement of what it was really like back in the day and not the loathing of an artist 25/30 years later. Sorry we lost Andrea True (November 2011) but her best was 1976/1977.
0	Disappointing work -not up to her usual high quality work,bland and lacking drive, I can see why they were in a vault!!!
0	Big mistake
0	I love the song, but as others have stated, the volume is really low. In comparison to other songs, I would say the volume is at about 20% of other music.  You crank up the volume all the way up, and it appears the song is being whispered.  The song can't be enjoyed like this. Very disappointed.  I should get a refund because I will not be playing this particular download anymore.
0	I was soooo excited to get this album because Donell's previous work has been great, but this album fell very short. If you're looking for the same groove as his single Love Like This you won't find it on this cd. There maybe one other song I like on the cd but its not even worth it. I wish I would have downloaded it or something that way I would have only wasted my time and not my money.
0	VERY well used copy.  Cover quite tattered. Didn't have any issues with CD, though it looked somewhat scratched.  I ordered based on a You Tube video done live somewhere in Europe that was posted on my FB page.  Disappointed over all.  Glad I didn't have to pay for shipping from the UK!
0	Awesome track but audio quality is terrible. I heard the same track on my regular FM radio and it sounded way better.
0	Should have songs listed hear no songs no purchasee
0	No where is the song when the horse and Red are rounding the tree after healing.  The emotional parts when the horse wins at the races is not there.  The best of the movie is not even on the SOundtrack....  Very disappointed.  I feel ripped.
0	Disappointed
0	Love Josh Groban, but this is my least favorite album. I was disappointed with the song choices - of all broadway songs to pick, why these?
0	I have all Chris Isaak's records. This isn't the worst (that would have to be Always Got Tonight) but it's not one of his best either. There are some mediocre songs and some good songs, but even the good songs are marred by lackluster arrangements. Down in Flames is a perfect example. That could have been a real stomper! Instead it sounds like elevator music. If you're new to Isaak please don't start with this one. Get your hands on Forever Blue and Heart Shaped World. If you're a long-time fan you probably already bought it, so why are you reading reviews anyway?
0	I was expecting the song I heard on the radio, not this offensive, explicit version.  Uses "b..." word, etc...no thanks!  Deleted it.  Waste of money.  A singer who refers to women in such a derogatory manner is not an artist, and not worth listening to, imho.
0	Skips.
0	I like bob dyan
0	Don't get burned!  These are inferior re-recorded versions.  For whatever reason it was done (and I know artists gotta eat, and Mitch deserves more fortune than he's got), it's terrible.  Buy Rhino's "Rev Up" instead.
0	Iggy Pop is a legend and on this CD he teams up with the accomplished Josh Homme, et al.  The finished product should be exciting, but it falls flat.  It just doesn't have the hooks or energy that you'd expect from musicians of this caliber.
0	This crapola is typical no talent, cheap, bump and grind dance Muzak. I find this nonsense revolting and would not, did not, order it. Why have I been charged for this, or the other stuff that I have ordered form Amazon that has not, will not work?
0	I'm a synthpop fan of sorts so getting this album seemed like it might not be so bad.  I had heard a couple of the songs on this album and didn't hate them but hoped the rest were better.  In my opinion they weren't.  The modern synthpop scene has grown to include much more than the 80s frozen in time.  There are bands like The Echoing Green who include guitars and drums from time to time in music that most people can't help but get up and dance to.  Bands like VNV Nation and Apoptygma Berzerk have driving rhythms and beats that would make anyone want to get up and ride their own Tour de France or compete in an impromptu Triathalon. This album is nothing like those bands.  I found most of the music made me feel like today was 1/1/1989.  There was very little bass and the beats and rhythms here were very slight.  So much so that the sound was very similar to the 80s sound of pure analog synth keyboards.  This is not to say that the cause for this album is not praise worthy and the bands are not quality.  Other 9/11 trinute albums represented a broad sampling of music.  Being a pure synthpop tribute album I would have expected the same but in terms of synthpop variety; I found all of these songs o be very similar and not of the style of synthpop I remotely enjoy. I feel safe to say that if you know any of these bands on here your feelings about their song should help you understand how you will probably feel about the rest of the album.  If you're looking for a sure fire CD to get enjoyment out of and you are totally unfamiliar with any of the bands on this CD I recommend taking the risk someplace else.
0	S***ty Album. He basically is complaining over bitches the whole album however I am not a long time fan. Discovered him from Scarface album and thought he was good so i decide to look at some of his projects which was a big mistake.
0	I think I'd love the music, but I haven't been able to load it on my computer. The music preview was great. Now if only I could hear the whole piece I paid for.
0	It's not as if there were extended instrumental solos. This extended version just had a lot more moaning and groaning and the intro had a lot more empty space.  Cheap, but ultimately not recommended.
0	Love Josh Groban but his disk was damaged on the last trak of the recording. Not happy!
0	Its ok
0	I wish I could've listened to the whole song before buying, I really didn't like the extra section by Kendrick Lamar, it was completely out of context and detracted from the song.
0	THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE, GET AWAY.  Released in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.  There is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.  This is one of those singer/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.  To make a singer/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.  John Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.  It also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.  The album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.  But, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.  The worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.  If you are new to Widespread Panic, get the live CD Classic City and then get the first two CD's, Widespread Panic and Space Wrangler, which are fantastic, five star albums.
0	An enjoyable album with a good delivery time.
0	i've heard there  stuff and its a  cool mixture of the folkys  sounding  stuff which at times can lead to a hybrid of other things, however  they fall into a phrase called  "Sleepy time Music" which works well with Coffee and  rainy  days,  however it doesn't do much for me wide awake and there material sounds like one long song which has some nice moments here and there, however  nothing that to  me  merits the hype they are getting.  they  have talent,  however they have found a formula early on and they  seem content on it, which will work  for folks who accept that from them, however others it feels played out before it had a fully good chance at developing.
0	I suppose this is an o.k. release if you like listening to beatles songs from guys with seattle accents. made me sleepy just listening to it...  better to buy  'Little White Lies ' by the band Fastball if you want to hear the Austin , Texas version of the beatles...you will love it ! I promise ! :)
0	10CC sucks! extra, extra, read all about it! 10CC sucks, and I'm gonna shout it! Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders were better as Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders. I would like to let you know that this is a great album to listen to if you want to commit suicide. this band only has a couple good songs, "County Jail", "I'm Not in Love" and "The Things We Do For Love", all brilliant songs. it puzzles my Dad as to why some artists can put out a real brilliant song, and then their other stuff is rubbish. my father listens to anything when he is drunk, and this is the CD he listened to. he sobers up and then he goes to relisten to find out it was rubbish and the only reason he liked it was because he was drunk. I've noticed that when previewing the CD's when I am drunk and placing my order, it arrives one day when I have sobered up, and I don't like it. my Mum was telling my Dad how awful this album was and kept demanding him to turn it down. the songs on this album are screechy, annoying, depressing and rubbishy. if you like this band, I recommend you listen to Gene McDaniels. he is also pretty bad, but not as bad as this junk.
0	It is one lady with one voice the entire time basically just reading fast. Too fast.
0	It's my own fault! It says right there that it's from the animated series!!  Otherwise it would be getting negative stars.
0	Had the misfortune to see this pathetic group of rockstar wannabees live at an all day event years ago. Spacehog headlined on the strength of that mediocre hit single but were easily the worst band of the day!!! Oh yeah, this album reeks also!!!
0	A lot if not most of these songs are not the original songs or artists!  It's misleading for Amazon to name the artist when the song has been recorded by someone else!
0	I really enjoy Dierks for his bluegrass sound. This album has none of this.
0	The content of this CD is folk songs not original songs by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Leadbelly. This Folkways re-issue is disappointing. The title/artist listing on Amazon.com contains more information than the CD. Songs 1-9 are Woody Guthrie, 10-19 are Pete Seeger (hard not to recognize his voices) and the last 2 by Leadbelly.  Based on the music alone, without context, the CD has very little entertainment value. When was it recorded? All we know is that the CD contains re-issues of Folkways original recordings. I am admittedly not a big fan of Folkways recordings as entertainment, although they do have historic value. Folkways eschewed normal recording techniques to make "authentic" recordings.  Virtually no effort appears to have been taken in the re-issue. Some of the songs sound like they were recorded through a tin can. Some tracks have a 60-hz hum that intrudes if you turn on up the volume.  There are much better collections of songs by all three of these great artists but if you want to hear them sing good old folk music, this may be your choice.
0	expected the real artists not remakes sang by some unknown group. my mistake for the price you pay. you get what you pay for. :(
0	No
0	Neckbeard: A man who is socially inept and physically unappealing, especially one who has an obsessive interest in computing: people expect me to be some sort of balding, overweight neckbeard. code from the console like a true neckbeard.  Neckbeard is a pejorative term for people with negative stereotypes such as social awkwardness, underachievement or pretentiousness. The term is often associated with neck hair growth and may refer to overweight unkempt internet users with strong political views. Neckbeards are also associated with Comic books, Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, Otaku subculture, My Little Pony and certain games. They tend to have hair growth on their neck and sometimes wear fedoras. Neckbeards have been called the "neard".Neckbeards have often been associated with various communities, including feminism, incels and men's rights movements.
0	The item is awesome..the CD case came cracked in many places.
0	Waste of money. Just someone recording at an Oktoberfest (or party). The background noise and cheering is louder than the music.
0	Was not up to Ronnie Dunn's great talent.  Returned it and got a full refund.
0	Should be called "this comedians a hack" I would hope a "professional" stand up could outsmart an audience member.
0	If you ever go to a country music bar, you'll probably hear this song, a real classic!  Love this song!
0	My daughter for her 11th birthday got this CD. Not knowing that it was only a CD single. I'm a father who doesn't live with his daughter so I use Amazon alot for birthdays and Christmas. Well that stops now. As for this item... If this is not a CD single then my daughter got the wrong item. $16 for a single... No Dice!
0	one of my favorites,  me and one of my trucks was in smokey and the bandit 2 with jerry reed so I knew him personally.
0	I absolutely love Barber's Adagio for Strings and has been a favorite for years. I just recently discovered Bond and am amazed at the great combination of the new and the classic. Keep up the good work. BUT, when I saw that Bond had done a cover of it, I had to take a listen. OMG, what were you thinking?  All the techno stuff overpowered the delicate sounds and killed it for me. Thanks, still love the other stuff, but you kinda ruined this one, good try.
0	Should have been titled " Stalking from the outside " or " Shouting from the outside "  Typical cry me a river Adele lyrics .
0	Actually I really love this version of the track and was glad to purchase it.  However after purchasing and downloading, I realized that  the track's time of play was only 6:09.  The actual full version of this track is 9:33, essentially cutting out the entire section of the fantastic rhythmic organ riff which makes this song great.  Therefore, BEWARE: If you purchase this song, know that you are NOT getting the full original version.
0	I was surprised when I first saw her new music video from this album. What a combo! Nowadays, Jewel is the combination of Britney, Christina, J.Lo...etc. Don't you think the world is full of pollution now? All muisc lovers, if you want a healthy ears, please don't listen to this album; if you want a healthy eyes, please don't watch her music videos or pictures, and don't buy her products for less pollution! Thank you!
0	You're going to release a best of Sweeney Todd and NOT include Roxy Roller? I was and am supremely pissssssssssed...
0	These are not real German singers, they have accents. It is nothing what they advertised it. Music stinks.
0	I purchased this product mostly because it had the song I was looking for in it (La la la).  Sadly when I started listening to the cd from the beginning little did I know that the lyrics were explicit (not on La la la, but on another song).  No warning prior to buying this cd.  If I would have known, I would not have purchased it and waited until the song came out on another product (which it did on the Now 50).  Music is not bad at all.  A nice rendition of Get Lucky featuring Tanika was a pleasant surprise. Nevertheless,if you are looking just to hear music (or clean lyrics) this is not the cd for you.  It wasn't for me.
0	Did not order this.
0	there is no need to listen to music. it sucks really bad and it is detremental to people. no music
0	Good music, but uneven recording levels between tracks, a few are far too soft, some tracks lost bass and others lost high treble tones, and a few cut off too abruptly and this damages what could be a great list.  It's still worth the listen, but don't expect it to be the same quality as volume one was.
0	This is the rap cover/remix by Run-DMC, not the Aerosmith original as advertised.  Save yourself the customer service hassle.
0	Bob Dylan - Slow Train Coming Nothing new musically - your standard run-of the-mill, very simple, 80's pop-rock/blues fare.  In track one, "master lyricist" Dylan "sings" the following: You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy, You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy, You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray, You may call me anything but no matter what you say You're gonna have to serve somebody  Who does he think he is? Ray Jay Johnson Jr.? Dylan isn't much of a singer to begin with, but 22 seconds into track 3 he warbles a note so sour, that I cringed as if somebody scratched nails across a blackboard and nearly hit eject.  A few clunkers that ran from 1:54 to 1:58  had the same effect -- awful.  Dylan should stay away from ballads (that should be like a law or something). Is track 5 a reworking of "Cocaine" by Clapton?  This album could use some -- the white powdery stuff, not Eric. Track 9, another ballad? He'd get beers thrown at him on karaoke night in front of even the most talent-starved audiences. If you're really after Christian music that's just an imitation of real rock and roll, just grab an album by Petra or Whiteheart or even Stryper.  If you are a Dylan fan, grab one of his good albums. Mediocre music, awful vocals.  Slightly above average "Jesus-freak" lyrics (for good Christian lyrics, check out John Michael Talbot or Keith Green). 1 star because it is Dylan.
0	First let me say, I absolutely love the song BUT it will not download for me.
0	This is BS, the purpous of digital music is to choose what songs you want and not forced to buy an entire album.
0	Oops sorry I never thought I would say this but this was horrible.  I don't get this CD at all I want my 999 back on I m going to trade this train wreck in bye Felicia
0	I honestly hate how one tries to out-shine the other. This is a duo. Act like a team!
0	I was dissapointed when i got this, for some reason i thought that these guys were going to be a resergence of the before punk-pop mid 90's punk rock that i really like, kind of like Green Day's insomniac, but it sounds just like every pop-punk band out their and it ..., all their choruses have na-na-na-nananana in them, it is just pop with distorted guitars.
0	This song is so mediocre I thought I was going to fall asleep. Mariqueen's voice is barely passable. She's a terrible singer and not an interesting one either. You know how some people may not be able to hit every note, but at least have a unique character to their voice? Mariqueen is not one of those people. She cannot sing. She is 29 years old and no amount of training is going to improve her vocal abilities. If this is the song that's going to be released as a single, well, it's not saying much for the rest of the CD.  Reznor's music is always the same in lyrics and sound.  This songs sounds just like NIN's Ghosts and the Fragile mated and created the most average, banal offspring ever. How many melodramatic songs about self-destruction, suicide and depression do we need from Reznor? Like NIN wasn't enough, now he's making his wife sing that crap. Reznor has created the the dream-team of depression. How To Kill Angels is the lamest band name ever, and it sounds like something a 13 year-old would come up with. It just seems like Trent isn't impressing anyone anymore,he's more of a tired puppeteer.
0	Who came up with this song?? Lyrics are AWESOME but singer is butchers song with less than mediocre voice. Wish she would have taken singing lessons or vocalization lessons, OH WELL.
0	If you have the PC version of Portal, DO NOT BUY THIS. The reason is that if yo get a free program called GCFScape and open C:/program files/steam/steamapps/portal content. GCF in GCFScape, you can then find the song still alive in this program. Once GCFScape has portal content. GCF open, double click portal. Then, double click sounds. Then, double click music. Finally right click portal_still_alive.mp3 and click extract to choose where you want it. By doing this you agree that I am not responsible for anything that happens to Portal or your computer(s).
0	Nice tunes, but seems Mark has little to say... Lost the drama. Becoming repetitious. Cannot recommend. But if you are a die hard, like me, you'll  buy it anyways.
0	Have a love of instrumental music and a wondreful new found joy for Peter White and am  a big fan of The Isley Bros,so it so nice to have him do such great tune . when I heard The version of the Temps,I already aam a fan
0	I like the singers and the song; but, not the 2 together.  I thoought I was ordering the original hit.
0	Not sure who ordered this. Wasn't me. Sorry for the mix up. Can't speak on a product I do not know.
0	Good!! Thank you
0	ANNOYING
0	I was eagerly awaiting an Il Volo new release, and pre-ordered this album before its official release date. This CD includes Xmas songs, a curious and strange pairing.  I had already bought the Xmas CD long before the season, hence I did not need them again.  I even own the Spanish version CD.  What were they attempting to do?  The non-Xmas songs on this CD are mostly without feeling, and do not do justice to their beautiful voices.  I simply adore these young men and I hope that the person(s) responsible for deciding which songs the trio sings will do a better job the next time.  I will continue to be a devoted Il Volo fan as their voices are so beautiful and uplifting.  However, this experience certainly takes me out of the realm of advance ordering.
0	This is the worst thing I've ever heard. That includes that time my girlfriend farted in her sleep and it made me sick.
0	Very disappointing. Not sure what's going on here. This lacks the energy I've come to expect from In This Moment.
0	Fantastic.. So fantastic I bought one for friend too
0	I have purchased music from Amazon before and have always been able to download it. For some reason I can not seem to download this tune so I can play it when I am not online???
0	I have to say I was a little disappointed with the songwriting and the guitar pieces on the album. I know it's hard to replace John F but I thought the tone of the guitar was off, not mixed right and it was just filler for most of the songs. This is the first album I've heard from them where I've been disappointed and they are one of my favorite bands. It has a few songs that are ok and it has potential but I feel like it falls short.
0	I didn't like it at all.
0	When I heard Susan sing the piece from Les Miserbles  I loved it.  This CD was a disappointment, but probably my choice in music differs...
0	This album marks the beginning of an end as far as Joni's career, after this album she began moving away from her folk roots and more towards Jazz.
0	This song sounds like it's being sung from a big metal barrel. It just really has a very bad tone, which is so sad for such a beautiful song and beautiful voice. It's just a bad recording!
0	not what it claims to be, Steamroller is a different version.
0	I gave this song to starve because the content of the music however the quality of the soundtrack was great
0	This guy took a bunch of awesome dance tracks and tried poorly to rap over them. This whole cd is trash. These songs arte old in the Electronic community and now suddenly the main stream is trying to adopt them to be cool. This guy is pathetic and unoriginal.
0	I didn't realize this was the edited version, therefore most of the songs ( I was very anxiously waiting to hear) were bleeped out.
0	Chrisette Michelle is a very talented singer! I thoroughly enjoyed her 1st Album, jammed to the 2nd Album, and this one not so much. I'm having a hard time just trying to enjoy it. Let Freedom Reign is not her best work. Almost every song sounds alike. I've seen her in concert and can testify that she has a true talent and gift; however, I'm just not moved by this album. Which I think every person expects when listening to an artist; to be moved, changed, or just to vibe. I'M NOT FEELING IT! But I will continue to support her as an artist and peacefully respect her right to express herself (even though I am not feeling this album).
0	Now there are two(2) albums unworthy in the Van Halen catalog, I only own this one . It wasn't worth the wait. " l love you people, you pay my bills." Enough said.
0	i didn't care for it , sorry differeance strokes for differences folks . my likes someone else dislikes . sorry
0	Such a poor song with bad vocals and bad lyrics. Sounds the same as anything else nothing new here. Wish there was something good but here there isn't.
0	Barbara Mason is an outstanding singer.  You don't have to sugar coat her music with expensive background up grades.  In this case, such treatment has diminished her raw talent.  Just present the original recordings and let her shine.
0	I ordered it a few years ago and it never arrived. I don't even like these guys anymore. Very displeased and annoyed.
0	The first album rocked. Not sure what happened with this one, its like some weird mixture of The Beatles mixed with Mowtown, mixed with...I just don't know. I can see stretching your boundries, but yoga has nothing on this, it's a hell of a stretch.
0	Sounds like I need to do drugs to listen to this electronically manipulated song... I don't do drugs.  Sorry.
0	the packaging made the cd looked used, everything looks bad quality and it doesn't not include all the songs that says in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	Cuts off abruptly at the end.
0	THANK GOD THE POWER HAS FALLEN!!!!!
0	This cd is so bland and boring. What happened to the Rob Zombie who use to write songs like thunderkiss65 godslayer and every song on astrocreep 2000. I don't know who sold out worst metallica or rob zombie. Plus what is with all the fillers hes been putting on his album. I gave him a bit of mercy when sinister urge came out because that was a very rushed album. But theres no excuse for the poor music hes writing on this. What makes me angrier is that the album started off pretty good and heavy then foxy foxy came up and that song is ridiculously bad. Then the album just seems to go on and on. If you want a really good album I suggest every go out and buy the new Sepultura album it doesnt dissapoint.
0	I am a huge fan of GVB but i must say how disappointed I am with this cd. A big letdown for me.
0	I ordered it and it arrived fine. However when I opened it the inner sleeve was all crumpled up and then the first song (Radioactive) was horribly scratched up and skipped. So I was ok, I ordered a replacement... but this one was the exact same! All the other songs were fine so the problem wasn't with the turntable. But the first song skipped horribly.
0	you have to be a moron to like this
0	This has to be the funniest set of reviews. That I have ever seen for a cd. There is no way you can call this punk. I am sure half of the little kids out there will though. This is mainstreme radio's answer to giving all the Trl viewers another Blink 182. Well, guess what, They don't have the talent and they don't have the punk credibilty. This is manufactured for the masses. I hope you kids relize that punk goes much deeper tha trl. If you want some good suggestions Try The Alkaline Trio,Face To Face,Pennywise,or The Smoking Popes. I have plenty of reviews of punk music for you to look at. If you really want to hear real punk music.
0	I like many others have been a big fan of M&S, their sound and the earthy feel of the music keeps me interested in every song. However, I cant even pay attention listening to the samples...I keep listening but unlike the other 2 albums I forget that I am actually listening to music. This style will appeal to a large audience and is 'safe' music. Rather than feeling like the engaging band we all love, this feels like any of a hundred albums I can pick up from major studios trying to placate the current audience with their music formulas.  Come on, you are better artists than this. The lyrics are good but your instruments and beat do not work unless you are going for elevator music.
0	I've been a fan since the beginning, back when i was listening to the first vinyl EP.  I was in the audience for both nights of the Live Evolution DVD being filmed at thre Moore Theater in Seattle (I can be seen in the audience and in line outside the theater).  The triumphant comeback of this magnificent "hometown" band in 2013 with Todd on vocals was an absolute dream come true. I listened to that CD for practically two whole years until Condition Human came out.  And then Condition Human came out.  I have to admit, I'm disappointed.  All the skill and talent is there, but the arrangements just seem boring compared to that last album.  It has a few good moments, but very few.  The rest of this album is just a sleeping pill.  The pure terrifying/satisfying punch, raw power, and melody of the last album just isn't found here.  The band is tight as ever, but Todd's vocals are all over the place, as though he's trying to hunt for the right melody to sing and failing to connect.  PLEASE don't tell me that he's suffering the same thing that other singers do when they start getting older (the last 10-15 years of Dio's singing career was abysmal on stage, same with Geddy Lee).  The musicianship is pure perfection, of course.  But the vocals and arrangements just fall flat on this one compared to the last album.  Sorry, but I listened to this one a few times, offered up a huge "huh?", and went right back to the 2013 album.
0	Not speaking for the rest of the album but the hit song Guesthouse shows an extraordinary amount of research into ,,, ripping off Paul Siimon. People like this song because it recalls Paul Simon. Hopefully some of the other numbers feature some originality.
0	So irritating to hear these guys paint radio rock with a thin layer of metal, using the deteriorating skeleton of the "Soilwork sound" as a brush. So pitiable to hear Bjorn awkwardly [attempt to] hit notes outside his vocal range. So ironic the album cover is proportional to the music in terms of boringness.  Oh, but then there's "Blind Eye Halo," the obligatory pseudo-thrash snoozer. The inclusion of this song means Soilwork are as great as ever, evidently. Too bad the drug industry could sell bits of this song to cure insomnia.  Basically, this album is fail. Try Chainheart Machine and A Predator's Portrait, those albums were Soilwork's peak.
0	This was a listing for a band called "Smithereens" and the album 1234. This is not the new jersey based band "The Smithereens" whose first full album was Especially For You. "Smithereens" is a british 80's pop synth group, and a low average one at that. Nothing memorable on it.  Here is the tracklisting for this album  Tracks: 1.) You is a Guarantee 2.) For Love 3.) Promiscious 4.) Speed of Life 5.) Time Ticks Tragedy 6.) Just Enuf 7.) He's a Sucker  Hope you find this helpful
0	The song itself is GREAT and gets 5 stars!! The recording really sucks and sounds like it was done by a bunch of high-school kids for a class project. They had fun cutting and pasting the tracks in all the right places, but the sound is absolutely HIDEOUS!! In my opinion, anybody who deals professionally with music would not have allowed such bad sound to hit the shelves. I've read another review of someone who purchased vinyl and was complaining about the noise due to cheap polymers... The vinyl itself I'm sure is just fine. It happened in the recording studio. Pharrell should re-record and re-release this, but make sure he's got his ears in the editing process.
0	Came with a broken case
0	The music is pleasant - Hal's voice is easy to listen to. I would like it better if he would leave Music Roads Records which is owned by Kelcy Warren, the man that is building the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Comanche Pipeline. Hal should join Jackson Brown and defy Mr. Warren. Fight the good fight for the earth.
0	Obscure psychedelia which is so inept and amateurish that its flaws are somewhat endearing. At its best, the group has a fractured, Syd Barrett-type appeal (particularly in "To Be Free"), but the slower songs are a shaggy mess. The songs barely hold together either structurally *or* technically, and the musicianship (especially the singing) is awfully erratic. Beware of druggy bongos! On the other hand, "My Clown" (which would have been a good choice for Rhino's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nuggets-II/dp/B00005JGA7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nuggets II</a>&nbsp;box), "Jolly Mary" and "To Be Free" are nutty fun, and "Crying Is for Writers" is interesting just for its unusual subject matter. The other tracks you can probably toss, unless you're keen to fantasize what they would sound like if recorded by a better band. Dock the group an extra point for not only having an unforgivably dull name, but furthermore titling the album with the same!  Note: July is also somewhat of a historical curiosity, since guitarist Tony Duhig moved onto Jade Warrior, singer Tom Newman became an engineer who notable worked with Mike Oldfield and bassist Alan James later played with names such as Cat Stevens, Kevin Coyne, Showaddywaddy and Neil Innes.
0	WE Never recieved this c.d. would love to know why..
0	Pretty much aimed toward the die-hard Petards fans and completists. It's a three track CD single, which looks to have one original member - bassist Roger Waldmann. "Kids (Are The World)" is so-so, "Golden Glass" didn't do much for me at all and then there's a karaoke cut for "Kids (Are The World)". I, personally could not picture anyone who'd want to karaoke to that song.
0	This is listed on Amazon as David Bowie and Pat Metheny, both as "artist, composer," so I assumed that they would, indeed, be the artists of these mixes. They are not. These covers are rap music.  I have the song on Bowie's "Nothing Has changed" box set, and I assumed these were different mixes.  Of course, this is partly my fault because the cover does say "Souldiers," but I have no idea who or what that is. I based my purchase on the fact that it said Bowie and Metheny were the artists.  Bottomline: If you like both Bowie and rap, you may like this. If you don't like rap, you don't want this.
0	Terrible sound..
0	To put it simply, it's repetitive and boring.  We know you have money and you like weed Wiz.  How about something different?
0	THIS IS NOT LIVE MUSIC FROM OZZFEST, IT IS JUST A BUNCH OF SINGLES THROWN TOGETHER!!
0	I really wanted to download this song but the mp3 downloader apparently no longer works with my Mac desktop.  this stinks.  I don't want iTunes downloads dang it!
0	Ok, fut just seems like a repetitive sound over and over which I find somewhat frustrating instead of soothing.  Word.
0	While a 2 star review sounds harsh a lot of that is due to my personal taste.  I bought this CD based on my experience with "Rock and Roll Jesus" which I think is fantastic.  Kid Rock started out as a rapper with a rock groove and matured into a bona fide classic rock artist with a Bob Seger Motown rock feel.  When I heard the first single "First Kiss" I expected more of the same but the rest of the album is decidedly more country than anything else.  Kid sounds great and the band is solid so my review is strictly based on personal preference which is why I rated this as 2 stars.  If you're a fan of country I think you'd be very pleased with this effort.  If you're looking for a more rocking Kid Rock sound similar to his recent efforts I'd steer clear.
0	The rudder has shifted and a new course is being charted. I do not like the course and may abbandon ship. It's as if Point of Grace has sold out to the pop- country music world. To me, the excessive country twang is nauseating. What is the deal with the song "Love and Laundry?" "Put on my mascara while I drive on down the road." Come on now...... The word "pray" is in that song so I guess that counts as a religious song right?? Here are the songs I feel are worth while: He Holds Everything,There is Nothing Greater Than Grace, What About Jesus, and Come To Jesus. That is it for me. Four songs out of eleven. I miss songs like: I choose you, The entire Steady On CD, Keep the Candle Burning, and All the World. The new country sound is not for me. The group Genesis continued successfully as a trio for a while but maybe for Point of Grace, it is time to fade into the sunset.
0	Holosync is 1) Outdated 2) Overpriced 3) Cannot live up to its claims (no one could)  Holosync uses binaural beats, which is fine, but rather "old school" at this point.  Isochronic tones are widely considered to be more effective, but binaural beats are quieter and can therefore be more hypnotic, so there is room for argument.  Holosync wants to stress your brain until it breaks down and can take more stress as a result.  huh?  There is no other product on the market that states that you may experience "upheaval" on a regular basis as part of a process.  That is ridiculous.  You should enjoy your meditation sessions.  ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL!!!  Look around.  If Holosync is right for you, great.  But it may not be...don't buy the hype, check it out for yourself.
0	I think she is one of the best singers around, but this cd, what is she trying to do? is BORING AND SHE SING WITHOUT ANY FEELING what a disapoinment, I hope she'll return everybody their $,is this a new style spare us please
0	Received one disc with scratch on it.
0	this was not the version that they are famous for.  This version had less synth, a more quiet volume of the singing and was just boring.  It was like a coffee house version of the song.
0	The last several seconds of the song is abruptly cut off.  Irritating to say the least.  It is a great song, however, I would like to have the entire track.
0	KW should respect true artistry and never sing again. All he's good for is playin the Jackass at Grammys.
0	Not for me but my aunt loves it!
0	This is a completely awful song that is only good as a joke, for a laugh, and a parody fashion show.
0	Love the cd but no booklet...
0	Every song I buy here on Amazon stops abruptly. There is no end. It just stops. I buy my music here for my DJ business and I have to over lap every song I buy here without letting it end because it just cuts off. Most times it doesn't even play the last two or three words of the song. I am looking into buying music somewhere else,
0	loved his songwriting His voice real strong  Excellent country music highly recommend this  alum have recently bought two more albums of his from amz
0	Gross... glad I didn't actually pay for this song.
0	Bought song. Downloaded cloud. Could never find song on my computer. I have a credit for mp3 but won't bother to purchase. Don't need aggavation.
0	I did not enjoy listening to this music during meditation, which is what I had hoped to use it for.
0	Was okay.
0	This is a song that needs some soul behind it...not a trait of Cyndi's. I wish I had listened to it 's sample.
0	I HAVE THE FIRST PART THIS HOWEVER IS THE SECOND PART TO THE "HITS" I GUESS BUT THIS CD HAS MAYBE 3-5 SONGS THAT ARE CATCHY BUT OVERALL THE COLLECTION IS VERY UNLISTENABLE AND FORGETTABLE
0	I already have the cd with this song on it..this is only one song played 4 different ways..It came fast in the mail and has no problems. But I don't need it.
0	It would be nice if I could put this song on my player, but it's locked in the stupid cloud and I can't get to it.  I'm buying future songs from iTunes.
0	I bought this album hoping some of the rave reviews were justified.  I have wide tastes and listen to a range of music from world to ragtime to rock to classical but I just couldn't get the hang of this one.  After my first play, I re-read some of the rave reviews and listened to it again but still couldn't find anything and had trouble even continuing to listen to it.  The singing seems out of tune half the time plus being rather banal and sometimes just rather irritating.  In some ways it reminded me of the laid back emptiness of music on Soul Train.  I wish I had liked it more, just not to my taste.
0	It's a good song but would seriously appreciate if it would play everything has been updated and still won't play
0	I love her but this is not her finest work. Try her cd w Chet Atkins -- simpatico Better songs
0	The version I downloaded was not the original vinyl version,which is what I thought I was getting,so that's my comment.
0	The first reviewer to note that this song is very much similar to, if not the same as, track 13 titled, "Far Away (Alejandra's Phone Call)" on the soundtrack from "All The Pretty Horses" is correct.  However, as to another reviewer's claim, there is no relationship to the track from Moby's "Play" release.  Aside from both songs having been recorded with nylon-string guitars, I'm not sure how the two could be confused.  The ASIN number for the "All The Pretty Horses" CD is B000056KYJ.  Enjoy.
0	This song is not the one that played over the radio years ago,,, quite frankly it sucks and I'm out of a $1.29,,, thanks Amazon for not warning MP3 listeners as well, a double thumbs down for you as well :(
0	I have a feeling these live shows are a lot more fun live than this recording would suggest. Here, the 1993 big band sounds a little like overkill and James kind of overdoes many of his best songs, adding all kinds of new notes and swoops and hollers that are fine as part of a live show, but which you don't want to hear again and again, as here. The essence of JT is simplicity, but his treatment of his catalogue here is a little too ornate. I would stick with original albums or greatest hits if you only need a JT sampler. This souvenir is for rabid fans who already have those and who want a live recording sample.
0	Not impressed
0	I met Joe after a show last week and asked him what his inspiration behind this special was and he said, "Think of a meat grinder and put in every happy memory you've ever had or ever will have." With that in mind, this special was just so.
0	I saw the Scissor Sisters on BBC America and enjoyed them very much.  I ordered a couple of CD's thinking I would get the same high energy music.  Many of their other songs have obscene lyrics I do not appreciate.  I am no prude but I think Scissor Sisters are relying on shock value to sell albums.  I'm sorry I bought the ones I did and I won't be purchasing others.  Deborah in Tampa
0	I don't know who this is maybe a Russian singer?  But I Do Know that this is NOT Massimo Ranieri It needs to be listed under another heading also it's really odd stuff...
0	It was ordered for son, personally, I don't consider it music, and find it hard to rate it as such.
0	The CD took its time in coming and when it did I found that the cover was broken.
0	If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best. Avoid it.
0	I am very upset.  Again I did not receive this item.  I don't even what it is about.  Would you please clear up this problem?
0	This song exists in it's original form as created by Michael Jackson. It's been around a long time. Michael Jackson is named The King Of Pop because he is the master of 20th century popular music. The track won't ever be better than the way he left it. How any producer or singer thinks they can make it better is laughable... the songs are what they are. You wouldn't buy a painting that someone else had drawn over and this is no different. Sony continues to rape the music this genius left us and affixes crap to his legacy.  ...We miss you Michael.
0	Absolutely boring enough to make you fall asleep but too "jumpy" and the loop cuts are very obvious and annoying.
0	Not for me
0	I don't understand, how serious Yes fans can consider this 'Fly From Here' to be a REAL YES ALBUM.  Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as "DRAMA, Vol 2"... ... But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE.  ... Hey, but... What can you REALLY expect when there's no more Jon Anderson and Rick (or even his so-talented son Adam) Wakeman, back in the full gang??? In addition, Trevor Horn has 'Buggles-ed' the music once again...  This 'Fly From Here', definitely, only has the cover art (another excellent work of the maestro Roger Dean) of a Yes album... The music, really performed by the band MAYBE... And ZERO stars.
0	Make sure that you search for all versions of this song before downloading. This is a lot different than their original cover.
0	I would gibe it a better rating if I could have heard or have found the song on my phone
0	Racist
0	The quality of the music is fine but the Armed Forces medley is in the wrong order! When the songs are arranged in a medley format, it is protocol to present them in order of junior to senior service, as follows: Coast Guard, Air Force, Navy, marine Corps, Army.  It should end with the Army and I needed it to end with the Army for a Veterans Day event.  It ends with the marine Corps Hymn.  I wasted my money and had to find another.
0	Horrible. Totally ruint a good bands music
0	except for a few cuts, this wasn't up to Automator's level......
0	Google 'theme from Brooklyn Bridge' and it will bring you to televisiontunes.com - this is THE original song that you know and love.  I too wasted 99 cents on this Muzak version.  Too bad CBS and Goldberg couldn't work out their problems and release the wonderful show that was Brooklyn Bridge.
0	A classic song given the "death metal" touch. Not my cup a tea, I'd like to hear their version of "Lonely Goat-herder" from Sound of Music.  Given a second chance, I would not buy it again. But I don't think I'm their target audience. Just my opinion.
0	Whenever buying "oldie" always be sure of two things: (1) Original artist, and (2) original recording.  For the most part this piece of crap is neither.  And worse, they try to play mind games by making the artists name close to the correct one, e.g., should be Andy Williams, but they have instead a similar name.  Please stick with Rhino or ACE or other reputable labels to refresh your memories.  This should be a crime.
0	I did not purchase this someone else must of under my account
0	This probably isn't the version of this song you want. You want the one with the wierd picture of George with the funky mustache/soul patch thing.
0	Pass on this version, folks. There are enough other ones out there (one of which I'm going to buy right now).
0	I've started to realize while listening to Amazon playlists and stations that Amazon must not have license for a lot of original versions of songs (seems to be quite a bit of "re-recorded" versions of songs). This may be out of Amazon's control, but it doesn't mean we should suffer at the hands of bad remakes or rip-offs. The horrific rendition of "Summer Breeze", rather than chilling me out, stresses me out! If you aren't going to use Seals & Croft, can we at least compromise with Jason Mraz's take? Bad call, Amazon. For the whole list. Bad call.
0	This guy is a tool and his music sucks.  He has no place in country music.
0	You really have to be very young or love HARD METAL and I am neither. Not recommended for traditionalist. Highly recommended for hard medal lovers.
0	Meh...heard it all before.
0	If this cd of Donna summer is so good why not let Us know the songs on it
0	I do NOT believe this is the Temptations, sounds like a Cover band. Great Tunes, but NOT the Temptations in my book
0	Did the MP3 download to my computer but it never downloaded even though it was charged to my credit card. And, it's not showing up in the Cloud Player or Digital Items. Not sure what the problem is with this. Did a search of my entire hard drive but there is no indication that this ever downloaded. It has been about four days!!!
0	Good tunes. Sounds fuzzy when ripped to hard drive. CD only sounds ok on CD player.
0	This is so bad, it's embarrassing....this isn't so much a comedy cd as it is the soundtrack to mass suicide, which is very similar to how the story of joe derosa and the lives of anyone who can say they actually think he's funny, should end
0	I was dissapointed it was only one song, i didn't realize that. But the one song is nice!
0	While at first it may be catchy and pop sounding, it becomes cheesy and repetitively monotonous. I thought this was something that was re-discovered by the original Bay City Rollers, only to be dismayed that it is only a former singer of the Bay City Rollers who is capitalizing on the past.  The Bay City Rollers "starring" Les McKeown is not the Bay City Rollers.  Don't get sucked in to the hype.
0	Never recieved. Got lost in the cloud. I did not understand the download between my computer and the cloud. I do not want to sign an agreement for the cloud wherein I will end up paying. So I chose download and it got lost...maybe it is up in the clouds I do not know. Hesitant to buy any others.
0	This version is nothing like the original - if you like trance, you'll probably like it;  if you're looking for the 1980s (superior) hit, your best bet is the German version, Major Tom (Voellig Losgeloest) by Schilling alone.  As of the date of this review, the English version isn't available as a download.
0	This is nothing but adolescent thrash. Cant believe people like this crap. i will never buy anything like this again.
0	I never really liked Hal's music, it simply wasn't that good. It's like a photocopy of a photocopy of something that might have been worth listening to. It's the kind of music that you listen to on a long car trip, and wind up turning off the radio. Now that he is denying climate change I just find it even more disgusting, like can the dude do anything right? Without support from ETP and Kelcy Warren, I don't think Hal's work would ever have been published.
0	Received this cd today and the case is cracked and broken
0	would not download i couldn't get it to even show up i want a refund, didn't even get it to show up!
0	Not a fan
0	Mendelssohn is my favorite composer, but I found this to sound very un-Mendelssohn-like. If this had been the first of his works I had heard I would not have sought out any more.
0	pure torture.  her loud wailing is ear splitting.cant believe i gave this song a chance when it came on satellite radio. i probably missed out on hearing a good song on another station
0	You don't get 50 concertos in this album - as the marketing folks don't understand that a single concerto contains several movements (usually) - and you get 50 movements - not 50 concertos - still not a bad choice of music - but unreasonably deceptive in title (and contents - as you are getting a lot less)
0	A fine band whose rarities and oddities are well worth exploring. At the time, their albums set very high standards for production, so this collection does the band, their production team, and their legacy a disservice by being in lossy format only. I look forward to a lossless version.
0	While the song and video is catchy I will be definitely be deleting it from any device I own. Psy spoke about killing American solders in one of his songs. This is extremely disappointing considering given if it was for American solders he would not be able to even have a career given that the North would overrun South Korea.
0	This is the perfect sound to drown out background noise.  For me its noisy teenagers in the swimming pool at night.  The big problem is the recording is NOT 75 minutes!!! but substantially shorter.  Find something else with white noise recorded for the entire track.  Too bad they took a good product and messed it up.  If the reason for the dead space was to get me to go to their site and buy a "better" recording, no way!  I have no patience for tricksters.
0	It's not bad it's great
0	What happened guys, get your shi+ together. Not what uabb fans wanted epic fail
0	I picked this up as the Amazon digital deal of the day.  So for $1.99 I can't complain too much.  The sound quality is relatively good, however my biggest gripe is that the song titles seem to be wrong.  I'm not an expert on the Big Band Era, and maybe songs were known by different names, however several of the songs are easily recognizable standards, that appear to have the wrong name:  Track 5 is listed as "See Saw", but is clearly "I'm In The Mood For Love".  Track 6 is listed as "Nevertheless", but is actually "Sweet Georgia Brown".  Track 12 is listed as "Body And Soul", but is "Embraceable You".  Track 13 is the most blatant: being listed as "A Little Bird Told Me", but being the song (and lyrics) "Blue Skies". So on the whole I doubt I have the right names on any of the songs.  Is this the correct content?
0	I have bought Music through Amazon preferring them to iTunes because because iTunes try to control their music too much. However after the latest MP3 purchase,  I find it now Amazon has made it as difficult as possible to download their music to my iTunes. Bye-bye Amazon. I guess I'm gonna have to go back to the iTunes Store  as much as I hate to.
0	When going through items that I had not yet reviewed I came across this. I was totally baffled at when or how I bought this because I did not recall buying it. I asked my husband if he had purchased it, but he acted as if he had no idea what I was talking about so I assumed our toddler must have somehow did it on accident. Upon listening to it, I was assured it was definitely not my husband that had bought it, and I had no reason to believe that our daughter randomly stumbled across it so I decided to go read up more about it. Once I started reading the reviews, it finally all made sense to me. Regardless, giving the song some credit because it's not really my preferred genre, I found the song itself to be pretty dark. Too, while it's free and everyone loves free, I didn't really like that it was just randomly downloaded without my permission or consent, as I wouldn't have really wanted my toddler to listen to it, especially once she is a little older and actually understands why it means. If you liked the genre and had just been cheated on though, maybe you'd actually like the song.
0	Soso
0	This is not a clean version of the song.
0	I made the huge mistake of purchasing this CD of a favorite recording from the past.  Without reading the fine print, I made the incorrect assumption that if the CD were available from Amazon, it would be a legitimate issue.  At this price point, I have purchased other old recordings that have been beautifully remastered. I am willing to pay the price for good sound. Well, was I ever wrong.  This sounds like a file made on a $100 machine from an original old LP copy.  It is full of hisses and warbles and worse.  The Chorale, one of the all-time great vocal ensembles, sounds as though it is singing in a vat of molasses.  Even the MP3 samples sound better than this CD.  It is a travesty that Amazon is distributing this inferior product.
0	5 Stars to Amazon, I have no issue with the purchase or shipment.  2 Stars for the content of the music on this CD.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Kid Rock fan, have all his albums, but this one sucks.  The first two tracks are good, the rest is trash.  When you listen to it, you get the distinct impression he is trying to hard to fill an obligation.  My advice, skip this one, just a waste of your money.
0	I just purchased the Songs for Worship - Tranquility and none of the songs on the 2 cds are anywhere near what they say they are.  The songs are nice but not what you would expect.  In fact, the first cd shows it is "All Creation Worships" disc 1 and the second cd shows "Holy Ground" disc 1.  For a $6.99 cd it's not worth the time or money to return the cd, but I am disappointed not to have received what I paid for.
0	No review
0	I thought (and hoped for) the vocals version - this is only instrumental, unfortunately.  Still looking for the one I want.
0	"25 or 6 to 4," one of the greatest songs ever - right? This is not "25 or 6 to 4;" it's more like "Love me Tomorrow" or "Your the Inspiration."  This is the Chicago that at one point said "You know how our band has an incredible brass section? What if we just used synthesizers instead?" It is that Chicago that made this album; and It is the epitome of Adult Contemporary garbage.  I own thousands of Christmas songs; I make a habit of collecting all sorts because I love listening to Christmas music.  I can not make it through this album to no matter how many times I've tried.  I've actually deleted it off of every playlist I have and have even deleted the album entirely from my hard drive and cloud storage.  Yes.  It's that bad.  Now if you like Adult Contemporary music; and if you could care less about classic-sounding Christmas standards; and if you think that 80s Chicago is better than 70s Chicago, you may love this album.  Though it is brass-heavy (a good thing), it is also cheese-heavy; and I am saddened and a little offended that I came to own this album.
0	Hmm...only two reviews here.  I guess I'll say what everyone if afraid to.  This CD is horrible.  Sorry fans, sorry Serj.  His voice is jarring over the softness of the symphony.  It is far better suited to his band and SOAD.  Although his voice hovered between metal and "opera?" this output clearly says leave the cellos and flutes to others.  In fact, leave it to 'Within Temptation' who does it justice.
0	There's nothing special about his album at all. It just sounds like every other pop-"punk" band out there. The guitar, bass, drums, and singing are all quite simple. Sure, some of the songs are catchy but it doesn't take long to get sick of them. However, I will rate the songs. Intro - I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be "copying" the intro from Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast. I'm not 100% sure on that, though. Nothing on My Back - Catchy tune, but loses my interest after a while. 6/10 Never Wake Up - WAY too short. Nothing specail about this song at all. 3/10 Fat Lip - This is the hit song from the album. It's actually not that bad. I don't understand the statement "Maiden and Priest were the Gods that we praised". If they were so big into Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, then why does their music suck so much more? 8/10 Rythms - Kind of boring. 5/10 Motivation - Catchy, but gets old really fast. 6/10 In too deep - Worst song on the cd. WAY too poppy and annoying. 2/10 Summer - Decent song. They seemed to do a better job with their instruments and vocals on this song. 7/10 Handle This - Alright, but gets on my nerves. Sounds too "emotional". 5/10 Crazy Amanda Bunkface - Faster than some of the previous songs, but not that much better. 6/10 All She's Got - This song is fast like the previous track, but not as good. 4/10 Heart Attack - Alright song writing, just not my style of music at all. 6/10 Pain for Pleasure - The music sounds a lot like Iron Maiden, with the dueling lead guitars and the galloping beat, but the singing doesn't sound like Maiden at all. Obviously the music isn't near as complex as Maiden. I would recommend that you save your money and buy some REAL music, like Dio, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, or Judas Priest
0	It's okay.
0	When I first bought this tune it played in the Amazon Cloud. Now it will neither play nor can I download it. I would like a refund.
0	horrible and I was expecting a completely other song... this was clearly misleading advertising!
0	I thought that Pete Seeger would be performing the Garden Song, but it was Arlo Guthrie.  I am so disappointed!
0	I've been a Black Keys fan since their days in Akron.  I expect an artists music to evolve over the years and I've enjoyed the Black Keys' progression.  Until now.  I don't know what they are thinking with this track.  I hope this is an anomaly on the album.
0	Not nice to listen to and just plain weird
0	This is crap. I downloaded this and it is only 30 minutes long. Do not waste your money on false advertisement. Sound quality is very bad. I had to turn it waaaaaay up to even hear it.
0	If you like typical rap glorifying sex, drugs, money and generally bad behavior combined with constant profanity, degradation of women and no substance whatsoever while furthering the black, thug-life stereotype, this is the CD for you!
0	the quality of the recording is poor
0	The music gets 5 stars.  The one star is for the packaging.  When I opened it, the CD case was smashed.  Luckily the discs somehow remained intact.
0	Don't waste your time and money on this book. I found nothing in it that a little common sense couldn't give me.
0	Sounds more like a David Gilmour album than a Pink Floyd album to me.... And it feels rather like a money grab.  Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I have every Floyd album after Syd Barrett left, and I liked / loved the all, with maybe The Division Bell not quite making it to the level of the other albums. I would like  to give this 1.5 stars.
0	file appears to have downloaded, but will not open or play. Will try to get refund. Will not download anything else from playlist.
0	Blown apart was so great. This is not
0	I'm sad to disagree with most of the reviewers here, but I hated it. I didn't even finish listening to it.
0	the music is stupid and thier isn't any words and i don't know them and i like the music but it is STUPID
0	I would have loved this but singer lost it for me. He did not seem to fit. I'm not sure what he was trying to do, a David Sylvian impression? He's probably a real nice guy but his voice made me turn it off after several attempts to get through the CD. Needless to say the music and the drumming is great. Did I mention I did not care for the singer?
0	Horrible song then and worse now. Geldof has been ignorant and condescending for 30 years. (FYI, in Ethiopia it snows and it's the 10th largest population of Christians on the planet. Band Aid money supported a brutal regime that created the famine in the first place.) Now Geldof, who has no medical training or even academic degrees, wants people to again give money to HIS PERSONAL CHARITY so that HE, not experts or even non-expert West Africans, can decide how to fight Ebola. He's got net worth of more than 32 million GBP. Why doesn't he use his own money for his pet projects? Because there are enough well-intentioned but uninformed people out there who couldn't find Guinea on a map without Google.  There is a much better, musically and talent-wise, song called Africa Stop Ebola done by West Africans in a public service announcement format.  Download on Amazon UK and elsewhere  PSAs are proven to help spread information and save lives. Unlike Bland Aid which seems to primarily be a vehicle for reviving Geldof's ego letting him curse on TV every few years when suffering grips someplace with little brown children.  If you really want to help, donate DIRECTELY to reputable organizations that work in Ebola-affected areas like Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders.
0	(2.5stars) With the virtual logjam of solid (but largely unspectacular) roots artists fighting to distinguish themselves from the rest, its quite easy for some artists to get completely lost in the shuffle. At the top of the genre, artists who are actually reigning in the game get free space to pretty much do (or ATTEMPT to do) whatever they wish, voicing with the finest in production talent and performing at the biggest stage shows and festivals in Jamaica and all over the world and releasing albums very frequently. Even the artists who are one level just below the ruling artists are afforded the same prospects, which is why roots reggae artists are amongst the most active in the entire musical world. At the top, we have artists such as the Buju Banton's, Sizzla's, Capleton's, Luciano's Richie Spice's and Anthony B's of the world (speaking strictly modern artists of course) who more or less have the lay of the land virtually having the key to reggae city. The next group of artists, the I-Wayne's, Turbulence's (although in PURE popularity, he probably actually belongs on the first list), Jah Cure (him too), Junior Kelly's, Jah Mason's. Bushman's, Lutan Fyah's, Warrior King's, Chuck Fenda's, Fantan Mojah's and others of the world also hold similar such roles in the game with SLIGHTLY less international popularity. All of those artists, through some way or another have found ways to distinguish themselves from the pack and have scored hits, and subsequent hits which have allowed them a greater bit of exposure, in and out of Jamaica, pushing their careers and messages to the next level. It is that next (overpopulated) group of artists who are in question in here directly. This group includes a virtual revolving door of artists who are either coming up or have seemingly reached a plateau and leveled off for one reason or another. These artists can, at times, also be a source of frustration for some fans (ESPECIALLY yours truly) because this group includes and has included, over the years, some SERIOUSLY talented artists who  don't seem to have the drive to push themselves to the next step. Think of artists such as Determine, Norris Man (who had seemingly took the next step with his big hit Home and Away, only to step back down over the past two years), Jah Mali, Mark Wonder and Abijah. You have SO MANY names, who by virtue of having one solid hit or an album, jump into this category, making it even more crowded and more difficult for these artists to take the next step and MAINTAIN the level of quality music and popularity as well.  One such artist who seems mired and stuck on that specific level is Kingston native, roots chanter Spectacular. Spectacular falls into a category with Jah Mali, Steve Machete and long gone Xterminator chanter (Roaring) Lion as artists who are genuinely SUPREMELY talented but for some reason can't seem to catch on and STAY on to a track leading to the big big songs of which they are clearly capable (although I must confess that Steve Machete, ever so quietly, is one of my absolute favourite artists). While in the case of the others, it may simply come down to a case of not recording enough or not having the proper promotion, I have no idea why Spectacular has failed to catch on and stay there. His talent is one, which is so subtle and so. . . Spectacular, that it really takes awhile to discover, but without a doubt, he maybe currently the only one with such a skill currently recording reggae music. Traditionally, artists with big, heavy and coarse voices have to almost forego having good melodies in their music in reggae. For example, the best cases would definitely be Capleton and Buju, both of whom are able to make melodic music, but in order to do so literally have to CHANGE their voice. Another example would be the free-flowing Jah Mason whose styles tend to go from night to day and back in the course of one four and half minute song. Spectacular? Nope. Spectacular is an artist who can actually make a full melodic record despite having abig bellowing voice. If you've never heard Spectacular (more on that in a minute), think of a lower pitched version of agitated St. Ann's (BIGGUP St. Annz!) chanter Perfect (himself, also falling into the case of having the big, melodically challenged voice, although he is one that hardly EVER attempts to change it). I first became aware of Spectacular around the same time I first became aware of Martian voiced Mobay singer, Jah Cure, as the two collaborated in the MAMMOTH combination tune Chant. Having initially heard that song on Jah Cure's Free Jah's Cure album, I was actually quite curious for a release for Spectacular, who promptly took a LONG leave of absence from reggae, only to return and, like many of his peers, almost immediately head for Europe. It would be in Europe that he would strike on with audiences and more pressingly, with producers and labels as well, which would go on to afford him his debut album in 2005 (curiously enough, for the same label, DHF in Germany, which would almost a year to the day later, release Perfect's debut, Giddimani, as well) Find Yourself. While Perfect's much anticipated debut definitely did what it was supposed to and lived up to expectations, the same cannot be said for Find Yourself, which is actually may be one of the albums which I had been most looking forward to in the last decade or so. Find Yourself introduces the international world (and reintroduces him to Jamaica), but doesn't come close at all to showing the chanter in his best light. Ultimately, one is left with the feeling that something was just missing here.  Unlike Giddimani, which was built largely on previous singles voiced for a variety of top reggae production talents internationally, Find Yourself is a largely German based reggae album, done by German based producers, yet it sounds quite familiar as many of the riddims are reworks and borrowings of more familiar pieces. Of the very few highlights on Find Yourself for the young veteran Spectacular (who just recently celebrated his 32nd earth day, happy belated to him), no light shines brighter than that of the opener, the ultra unique 50 Push Ups. If you are AT ALL a fan of reggae music undoubtedly you've heard songs speaking of the physically strong nature of an artist and almost ALWAYS such a song will turn inevitably to a sexual vibes. 50 Push Ups is a tune which doesn't go that way at all, instead, it speaks ONLY from a physically healthy point. Its very interestingly and quite possibly the first roots tune I've ever heard that not only speaks about being HEALTHY, but explicitly goes the extra distance in saying that one must be PHYSICALLY strong in standing up against oppression and those who fight against righteousness. Built over a fairly uneventful one drop (which has a heavy string backing at times), it still has a pretty melodically high vibes, showing exactly what I meant when I said that Spectacular essentially foregoes  changing his vibes in anyway and still creates melodies despite his heavy voice and 50 Push Ups, as the albums best tunes, is a strong example of this. If only the entire album could stay along the same level. Following the opener is the very familiar sounding decent Voice of the People, which flows over Germaican remake of Sly and Robbie's legendary Night Nurse riddim (which in its redone form was known as the Doctor's Darling riddim, and most notably featured Tanya Stephens` big hit It`s a Pity).Voice of the People is a strong enough effort and a very unsurprising include on Find Yourself and on although it has a very low vibes to it (due largely to the fact that Spectacular's voice is just too big for the very laid back riddim, it almost sounds like he's holding back at times, and completely free-styling at others) lyrically is quite an impressive piece. The song has a message of people and particularly those who are oppressed standing up in defiance of their oppressors, to the utter dismay and ultimate destruction of the oppressors. Then things head downhill and only REALLY make one turn back towards the good for the balance of the thirteen remaining tracks. Completing the opener is the downright odd tune Loud which features German dancehall singer (Mighty) Tolga. While I definitely have a healthy appreciation for both Spectacular and Tolga as solo artists (Tolga is a big singer, several nice its behind with a nice album as well), the combination just doesn't work. For his part, Tolga gives what he usually does, a higher pitched free-flowing style; but Spectacular, instead of his usual LOUDness goes quite all of a sudden (isn't that a coincidence, on the song named Loud he uses his  quietest voice on the album), with this just annoying growling style! And it all happens on an odd UK dancehall/garage hurried sounding riddim.  The one real other time you get a big vibe from Find Yourself which is better than just average or even good is another combination on the album, the very nice Blind to See. The song features the unusual natural voiced Gambian reggae singer Rebellion the Recaller. The vibe here is a much more natural one which works for both artists and while Spectacular doesn't run his voice to its heights, he doesn't change it much either (its basically a more singing version of his usual chanting sound) and of course, in the process creates a lovely melody throughout. Rebellion adds a very unique dimension to the song as well. The title track is another nice addition here which features full blown Spectacular in his usual fashion, but does so on one of the most simple one drops on the entire album (the Bonx It riddim). It also has a very nice message in that it suggests that the only REAL way to Find Yourself is to Find His Imperial Majesty (definitely) and should you fail to do so, you may Find Yourself in situations with which you aren't exactly prepared to deal. Stormy Weather is a similarly vibed track but it is almost COMPLETELY average and greatly UN-spectacular over the weird one-drop Black Survivors riddim (which sounds like the reggae version of a theme music from some spy television show from the 1970's or something of the sorts). And then there's Evil Retire, another VERY SLIGHTLY above average tune which almost has a freestyle vibes to it in my opinion and really doesn't give too much outside of the norm (I do like the riddim which has just about as SUBTLE horn usage as I've ever heard).  I do want to point out that, of course, lyrically Spectacular does his job. He never steps too far outside of the realm of roots reggae music and he pushes the ideology and concerns that we've come to expect from the genre and lifestyle. Its combining and translating those thoughts to music which is seemingly lost on the remaining tracks of Find Yourself. For prime example, check the unfortunately OVERLY familiar For So Long, which has the miserable `luck' of being voiced over the Campo riddim from Minor 7 Flat 5 records which I have LOOOOOOOONG tired of hearing completely. And the tune's message is very strong of maintaining oneself and one's mental strength in the face of those who fight against righteousness and even in keeping the knowledge that the song is over three years old (yet not part of the initial batch of Campo riddim recordings), I'm still unable to make it sound good in my ears, just AVERAGE. Speaking of average, check the closer, Gangsta with German Hip Hop group, The Specializtz. The song actually came as a welcome addition after going down the harsh mediocrity which IMMEDIATELY proceeds it (including two very similar sounding dancehall tracks, Family and Move), but doesn't exactly stand too wel on its own merits.  Overall, just as I mentioned, I was quite looking forward to hearing this album for awhile and it certainly doesn't come anywhere near living up to what I had hoped. Since this album was released and on more current terms, Spectacular has seemingly returned to the form he once exhibited prior to Find Yourself. In 2007 he (coincidentally) recorded the very solid Wrong Uniform combination with Steve Machete over the Heavy Duty riddim, also High Grade, an even stronger combination with Lutan Fyah for Irie Ites' Stop Dat Trrain riddim and enjoyed a generally very fine form throughout the year (also check the very nice Good In Myself over the Ghana riddim as well) all of which top 90% of the Find Yourself album. His 2007 was following another strong year in 2006 which saw him doing very nice combinations, highlighted by his combination with Turbulence, High Grade (again) for Mafia & Fluxy's Rocking Time riddim; showing himself to be WELL above what he pushed on his debut album. I hesitate actually recommending the album for anyone in particular, but MAYBE just very new fans to roots reggae, particularly those coming from a background in Hip Hop, MIGHT be able to enjoy this one. Otherwise, join me in waiting for the next piece coming from Spectacular which certainly (even if its just a collection of former singles) be better and much more Spectacular than Find Yourself.
0	This album is terrible. Where are the lyrics? The songs sound so plain without the emotion that lyrics would provide. I wish I could have my $5 back to get a Quarter Pounder meal.
0	Full disclosure, I have not listened to this entire album.  It was just too awful.  Look, the bottom line, this album is 40 years too late.  If this has been released in the 1970's when everyone was on psyc drugs, then I'm sure it would've been a HUGE hit.  But this is 2014.  It just doesn't work.
0	Heard so many times Lovato has a powerful voice. So I've been trying to find it in every CD she released. Have to say, after listening to "Confident" I finally give up. Because this girl is simply not gifted with such thing . Pretty sure that screaming loud, almost on the verge of voice capabilities,doesn't count so. On this record Demi sounds somewhere in between Katy Perry, Sia and Ellie Goulding. Moslty like Katy Perry, which is not good at all. Maybe Lovato vocal abilities are not that impressive like her fans say, but comparing to awful Perry attempts Demi can stay in tune at least. Guess,  that "Perry" sound is the fault of her music producers who reworked the singer's voice too much, cause I've never heard Lovato sounding like this before . The whole production on "Confident" is pretty much outdated. All that arrangements and music tricks have been used a  million times and in better interpretations. Confident. Womanizer by Britney? Is that you? Overall, except for two songs ("Cool for the Summer" and "Mr Hughes") there are absolutely no catchy tracks. "Confident" is a passage album, missing any sign of originality.  P.S.: in case of Demi Lovato, singing songs like "Confident" (by the way the lyrics for that track are one big cliche) and especially calling the whole album like this, shows even more how insecure she really is. 2 good songs = 2 stars.
0	As a shopper of the new Met Fresh Super Center, I actually hear this song played a lot. For newcomer, Katy Perry, she really doesn't seem to actuall have the appeal to really rock out loud. Her debut single, I Kissed A Girl from her debut album One Of The Boys, is one of the most displeasing songs I've ever heard this past year. She really feels like she is trying to be more like flavor of the moment, and sadly she wrecks her chance at the beginning. I really think she needs to really reinvent herself, if she wants to as good as acts like K.T. Tunstall, or even the tabloid drama Queen, Amy Winehouse. If she really wants to win people over, she'd better stop kissing all the wrong girls.  Song: F
0	Cheapest production ever...
0	When it has came down to Robin Thicke, musically he seems to have it all, as a singer and a father. But surprisingly, he had a song that really did not appeal in the he could've brought out from his past songs. He has done very well as a soft blue-eyed Soul crooner with songs like Magic and Lost Without U. Blurred Lines, Robin's latest song actually is not very good. It really seemed more like a attempt for him to get into the Youtube crowd of music lovers, but instead it felt more like a joke. I actually was not very impressed with the song, and it honestly was just as bad as the overexposure we've heard from people more interested in the Call Me Maybe and Psy music crowd. For Robin Thicke's next album, he has to have beter songs than this one was.  Song: D+
0	Forget it.
0	What a sorry, ill-produced excuse for a compilation. It looks eclectic but is just a mess. It starts with a bunch of noise and proceeds to never finds a flow. Songs jarr from one to the next with poor volume regulation, making for terrible background music - ironic as having it on during gatherings is generally the idea behind a christmas compilation. Many tunes seem like cheap b-sides that EMI probaby used at no cost. Even some of the songs with famous singers are lame, including the cheesiest rendition ever of "baby it's cold outside" featuring Dean Martin which isn't a patch on the Johnny Mercer/Margaret Whiting version. Then there's the ill-chosen Leonard Cohen "hallelujah" (a song I admire but not in this context); music producers seem to think people will be tricked into believing is a christmas song because it has the world hallelujah in it!
0	Not sure if this is Amazon's fault or Import CDs.  After doing a search on Amazon for "Alana Grace" this CD came up.  I ordered it thinking I would receive the Alana Grace CD, but instead received this CD which is by another group named NFD who, unknown to me, has a CD with the same title as the Alana Grace CD.  The NFD CD is only three songs and other than the title has nothing in common with the CD I was expecting.  Import CD did do a good job of shipping this very promptly.  Hopefully Amazon will improve its searches and not let this kind of thing happen again.  Definitely disappointed.
0	I loved Nick's last album and I loved his Nick & Knight album, sadly this album just doesn't do it for me.  I was really excited for this but there is so much trashy lyrics and talking about getting drunk.  Not at all what I was expecting from Nick, especially after reading his book and knowing the struggles he has had in the past.  I was really hoping for something I could listen to for years like his I'm Taking Off album, but unfortunately this isn't it.
0	Horrible
0	The original of a song is usually better than any subsequent attempt by others to do the same track-- and that's definitely true for this song. To each their own opinion, but Thomas Rhett did this song perfectly. Nelly has some songs of his own that are ok, but he needs to stay out of country and do an original song of his own.
0	I'm huge fan of hers loved the last cd and many others  but can't get into this one at all.. she mumbles and whispers thru this really uninteresting  album throughout.. with the exception  of 3 songs sounds like one long mumble
0	He is playing to his audience of people who hunt and fish.  Like Hey,  he's talkin' bout huntin' and fishin'...I'm gonna git this one.  Not that special.
0	I used to wonder why this album wasn't released on CD like the rest of Bill's work, but now that I've heard it, it's pretty clear that Cosby's producers didn't want to risk this recording contradicting the polished, strictly wholesome image that Bill had been cultivating since the early '70s. No, you're not going to hear him cussing at length or talking explicitly about sex or anything, but nevertheless, the tone of this 1968 album alone is out of touch with the warm, inoffensive quality that his later work is known for.  The collection features two shows from the same night (hence the title) recorded at Lake Tahoe; the two acts are supposedly divided by the nature of their content, but with the exception of one skit, I felt that they were pretty similar in tone. The 8:15 performance ("the Dinner Show") has Cosby interacting with and teasing the audience for 17 minutes before talking about golf, football, and religion for another 14; while the material is all "new" and hasn't been recycled in any of his other albums, it's not exactly laugh-out-loud stuff and generally sounds like space-filler for his "Sports" album. Disappointingly, half of the 12:15 show ("the Late Show") is Bill simply repeating stuff from the first act.  Luckily, he does tell a pretty entertaining story from his adolescence about braving getting beaten up to attend a party. He un-endears himself, however, by later talking about his marriage in vaguely unflattering terms and uttering a few homophobic comments during a story about drag queens. Concerning the latter, he's obviously exaggerating some things he says for the sake of getting a laugh, but you do get the definite impression that - at least during this point in his life - Cosby the equal-rights proponent was practicing a bit of prejudice of his own.  I've only listened to the album once, but I'm pretty sure that at no time other than his departure does Cosby receive a prolonged ovation...and rightfully so. Even if we are to completely ignore the uglier bits, not a lot of stuff on here is funny enough to merit a buy for anybody other than stalwart devotees who want to complete a collection.
0	Home for Christmas.  Sounds innocent enough.  But you would be well advised to stay away from this home.  It is a horrible place.  You'll be asking Santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd.  Alternately, you can buy it for people on your Christmas list that you don't like or just plain hate.  How bad is it?  Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo.  It had them babbling like babies in minutes.  But if you are a fan of Kenneth Copeland, go ahead and buy it if you must.  After all, the man has a private jet and he's gotta pay for that jet fuel somehow!
0	Cd case came apart when I opened it. The lyrics/paperwork on the inside were stapled upside down in multiple sections. I'm wondering if this is even a legit CD. I will let you know if it even works.
0	The general UMG description (editorial review) on how this Blu-ray release was remastered is not true..  this was taken from the 2011 Bob Ludwig remaster.  BLu-Ray audio is sadly taken from the 20th Anniversary Master, so the headroom is extremely limited and available fidelity and dynamic range of the Blu-ray format is a complete waist,  I wouldn't be surprised if UMG just used the digital master for the CD release and upscaled it for the Blu-ray production master.  From what I've read  and waveforms I've seen it seems like they used the CD master for the vinyl lacquers, I could be wrong about this, but why else would Bob Ludwig brick-wall limit the vinyl master exactly like the CD master but just a few dBs lower?  For someone like Butch Vig, being/been the album's producer who's done all these TV spots, podcasts, and guest appearances, with Grohl and Noveselic promoting this re-release, you'd think he'd want to be involved with the ACTUAL audio end of the remastering job and not just the publicity benefits.  I feel like if there was someone else there holding Ludwig's hands (ears) during the remastering process, except reps from UMG, we might have gotten a true HIFI audiophile release similar to the In Utero 20th release.  Hats off to Albini for still caring enough to actively be In Utero's producer 20 years later and suggesting DMM at Abbey Road, attended.  maybe for the 25th of Nevermind we can get UMG to do a HIFI remaster for Blu-ray and vinyl.  maybe get Howie Weinberg back too.
0	The Recording was scratchy and faded; very poor quality  I will not buy old songs from Amazon when trying to fill in my mp3 library.
0	Let me just say: I love John Mayer.  He may be crazy, but I think he is one of the best musicians we have from my generation and I will support him no matter what.  That being said, I must admit I'm not crazy about this album.  I was such a HUGE fan of Continuum and Battle Studies; this album just sort of falls short of those two.  I understand he was trying to return to his more acoustic roots, I'm just not sure it really succeeded on this attempt.  Either way, I will look forward to the next album all the same!
0	Only one good song here: Fear Not. Can't buy the song as a single. Rest of the songs have similar intent: Scripture set to music. Search on the net to preview the songs.
0	What can I say , I had to give it a one star , it's too short  songs is like 3 minutes long ,  beats are nice , lyrics are great ,songs full of emotion,and  insight , it is just too short ANDY I want more time so if there's anybody out there that know him personally tell him to make longer songs, I have all of his music , and as long as he stay on his knees I will continue buying his music , sending people to his shows , outreach ministries ,one, God bless , and for the record this CD totally deserve 10 stars
0	Disk skipped in places
0	This song is supposed to be a summer love song, that's sweet and cute, but let me say, Taylor Swift blows this out of the water, and half-way across Asia. Ironically, the two are doing a duet, which is like Rosie O' Donnell doing a duet with Leona Lewis. Totally mismatched.  All sarcasm aside, the song has more cheese than Wisconsin, more horrid sounds than a Chinese takeout kitchen, and more annoyingness than Rosanne. Really, whenever I'm forced to listen to this song at the gas station, I want to light a match, and drop it.  Boyce Avenue's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for, but it's still a 4-star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history. What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it's sort of catchy. It's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity. So in summarizing, don't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds, because you'll choke, and don't listen while you're depressed, because you'll kill yourself. Like drugs, JUST SAY NO!
0	Needed it to complete the rest of the record.  For some reason, I didn't have the entire album in my Library.
0	Slower version than the original
0	This is a bootleg release from dubious sources. I have no idea why Amazon even allows this to be listed, but do yourself a favor and save your money.  There is NO legitimate issue of this "2-fer". If you see this release, it's a bootleg.
0	Be aware that this track is NOT the original soundtrack theme song from 1968-69, it's some later re-recording that lacks all the sparkle and exuberance of the original bubblegum classic.
0	Have to agree with the prior review. The playing is not as fast as it should've been and it seems that the soloist is struggling throughout the solo parts.
0	I am a great fan of JMT.  His music is very inspirational, However, this a shabby, horrible sounding, cheap reproduction.  I returned it after listening to  half of it.  Don't judge his music by this  CD.
0	I don't know what program is being used to convert this song to mp3 format, but it is not of good quality. The song is overmodulated to the point of distortion. Just be aware that it's not a crystal clear copy.
0	Not as good as I remembered.
0	Ordered on accident by my 2 year old
0	Very slick pop album. One notable exception is a great song about a stalker called Haunted. This song is a keeper. It's nice to finally have a CD burner.
0	Perhaps Mr. Hartman has made the vocal version of this song unavailable as this is the second website to sell me the instrumental version. And while I do enjoy the instrumental, the vocals bring the real fire!  It would be helpful if the copy for this track would indicate that the vocals are omitted for the majority of the song.  "Relight My Fire" is truly one of my favorites. Sign me 'Disappointed again'.
0	I heard this song in my church and the band was great.  It was soooooo much better at my church than this slow jamz soul version.
0	was happy with a couple of the songs but not most and there weren't as many songs on the album to warrant the purchase.  Not pleased at all.
0	I don't know.  I vaguely remember the song, but to be fair, Amazon's s*** music service wouldn't authorize my phone to play the music I purchased... oh, don't get me wrong, it lets me buy more and add it to the library, but I can't actually listen to it.  So, word to the wary, buy it somewhere else.
0	I had no idea that 9 out of 10 songs were NOT ORIGINAL recordings  and 5 out of those 9 were flat out horrible.  Don't waste your money if you want ORIGINAL.  I had forgotten how bad K-tell recordings were
0	I didn't get it. It appeared very weirdly in my music files ( found it after much looking) and then there was no link only message saying file not available. This was a first try for me ( a download) , I'm not only not impressed I am very disappointed. I didn't know how to do a follow up
0	Like others, this one is not the original and I was disappointed when listening to it.  Another artist does it very well though.  His name is Shakin Stevens.
0	Not a hook on the whole thing.
0	Wishful singing.
0	Extremely slow!
0	Already had the cd
0	This is one of the worse Gospel compilation I've heard. This has nothing to do with Gospel. It's a mix-match of melodies, poorly played.
0	Good, but others I had reviewed had better quality and sounded more professional.
0	After waiting 4 arduous years for this CD I was immensely disappointed in the amateurish and deficient music it had to offer.  It is erratic and unfinished; the songs go from simplistic and 'folksy' to mega orchestrations that make you feel like you should be in church on a kneeler and the only one who should be begging forgiveness is Groban himself who is offering up this unadorned, unassembled, incomplete work that doesn't compliment someone with such a classically trained voice at all.  True it would be a shame if he had been MIA for so many years and then fed his true fans more of the same ballads and classical pieces but these are what drew the fans to him in the first place.  Awake was very 'out of the box' for Groban and quite enjoyable but Illuminations feels like he dawdled for 4 years then threw together a cheese sandwich at the last minute and tossed to his starving fans who were chomping at the bit for something new to chew on.  I have heard this CD but I will not waste my money on buying it.  I have been a fan of Josh for 6 years and the fact that he put together such garbage and calls it 'the best he's ever done' really disappoints me and I'm not the only one.  There are many of his diehard fans who don't care for this tripe but are stomped to death by fans who are blinded by the fact that it's Josh and it's quantity over quality.  Try to see it this way; it's as though you have been going to a favorite restaurant every day for several years because they make the best soup you've ever tasted and then after not having this delicious concoction for a few days go back to discover that they've changed the recipe and it tastes awful ... you wouldn't go back, right?  You wouldn't waste your money on another bowl just to see if you could grow accustomed to the new flavor would you?  Well after listening to it a few times just to see if I might "learn" to like it I decided that if I have to force or teach myself to like it then I really don't and there's no point in making me want to poke my eardrums out with a hot knitting needle.  You know the old saying "love is blind"?  Well in the Grobanite's case you could say "love is deaf".
0	Unless it's for nostalgia, this song is not very good. The recording is pretty bad and the vocals are raw and off-key.  They are so much better than their debut release, End of the Ring Wars.  I highly recommend starting at the Low Level Owl volumes if you're new to the band.
0	I really love my wife and added this to a CD I burned for her. She loves it and I wish I was deaf when it plays....
0	I am latinoamerican, and normally I like Marc Anthony a lot, but sorry, even if it comes from Marc Anthony I hate bad copies from good songs created only for comercial reasons.. In this case this is a very bad copy of the song: "C'est La Vie",  from Khaled. Listen it in youtube you will see that it is mutch mutch better.  Link in Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Cest-la-vie/dp/B00BRH2JVS/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1371755731&s=dmusic&sr=1-4
0	I have purchased almost all of his early CD's and loved his music until today when I bought this new one and heard a different sound, music & lyrics all geared towards a completly different market. Why the big change? I can not return this now that it is opened sure would like to. I should have read the reviews before I bought it and then made the dicision. I think it would have been better for his fans to make the change more acceptable by doing some songs from his old style and some from the new.
0	This album has estimable compositions and a professional orchestra.  The saxophonist, however, plays ALMOST on pitch, ALMOST with a good tone, and stays ALMOST on the beat with the orchestra.  I don't want to be cruel, but as a warning to those considering buying this CD, the tentative attack of the saxophonist sounds like an amateur practicing.  Amazingly, on tracks nine through twelve all these problems disappear.
0	This is an absolute waste of money if you want a good tribute to the bad boys of rock then pick up Down At The Whiskey. Its much better and still different but with actual talent unlike this piece of crap. http://www.amazon.com/Down-At-Whiskey-Millennium-1981-2013/dp/B00ERH142K/ref=sr_1_25?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1429367854&sr=1-25&keywords=motley+crue
0	The entire reason why I bought Babel was to have The Boxer.  Super annoyed that it wasn't on there.  There are 3 missing tracks that are on Babel that aren't included on the vinyl version.
0	Almost every track skips.
0	These guys aren't the Florida band who released 2 great albums on Capricorn in the early 70s. They instead are pathetic posers who, when confronted that they were in fact using a copyrighted name of an existing band, showed their stupid, nasty and rude selves immediately. It says something that everyone but these bozos knew about the name already being in use, but then some people are just plain stuck under a rock with their own little stupid excuse for a life. Add to that the fact that this album is way past useless, and it's easy to see there's a special place waiting in hell for their pathetic carcasses.
0	I preordered this as I was curious to see what this guy could do when he was NOT with Celtic Thunder. Unfortunately, this was a let down...oh sure, he has a great voice and I'm sure for all the hormone-loaded young females out there he is a gift from heavens, but for my middle-aged ears, this CD didn't do much. I love what he does with CT and I really like Tears of Hercules and Don't forget about me, but all the rest of the songs are bland and uninspiring. The usual sentimental pop crap, love you, love me, miss you, baby...heard it all a hundred times before and there's nothing special or memorable about those songs. I'm sure he could do a lot better if he wasn't so intent on pleasing a certain category of fans and of making a go of it in USA. He's great when he sings Irish-inspired songs..with his pop stuff, he's just another guitar-picking "Americanized" idol.
0	These demos were released without Donald Fagen and Walter Becker's approval and against their wishes.  "Sun Mountain", "Android Warehouse", "Old Regime", "Catalyst", "The Founders of Steely Dan", "Becker and Fagen (or Fagen and Becker) Presents" and the dozens of other titles this same collection of demos are constantly repackaged under are in their most primitive forms.  Do you really think Steely Dan, a band known for their sonic perfection, would want this revealed to the public?  If you're a Dan completist and care to hear the earliest demo versions of a few SD classics Barrytown (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pretzel-Logic/dp/B000V6ACUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pretzel Logic</a>) Caves of Altamira (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Royal-Scam/dp/B000V6738K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Royal Scam</a>), and Brooklyn (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Can-t-Buy-A-Thrill/dp/B000V673TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Can't Buy A Thrill</a>) try and borrow a copy rather than buy it.  I wouldn't give the cretin who released this a penny.
0	This is NOT the EP version. :(
0	After loving the first two albums I had high expectations.  Some people may call it "evolution" but honestly the music on this album is quite boring. No doubt the songs show how talented these guys are but this is quite a departure from the sound that made this band popular.
0	Aerosmith hired songsmith-for-hire Diane Warren (she was like the Max Martin of the late eighties/early nineties and wrote songs for a lot of chart topping pop crap. I mean, you hire DW to write song poop drivel, you might as well hire Michael Bolton as your singer.
0	Garbage
0	My radio station repeatedly plays Wasted and Wounded.  I must be getting pretty old because it literally sounds like crap (Refer to South Park episode "It Sounds Like Poo!!).  The part where they use some sort of device to down tune the words Wasted and Wounded.  I thought I had crap in my ears.
0	I can't access the song
0	The dulcimer tunes were nice, but it was unfortunate that the the vocals by Tom Conway were really, absolutely, terrible.
0	My friends used to listen to this band when we were in high school and thought I remembered that they had some good music. This CD is boring and does not flow at all. Its no wonder no one knows about this band. Terrible.
0	Listening now, just don't think I will again. Not really calling my name. Sorry! Tried again, didn't do it for me.  Lowered to 1 star.
0	I thought the longer version would have longer guitar riffs disappointed. Nearly a different song
0	it's not that I hate it.  I didn't get to hear it.  the track that I bought was only 6 seconds long.  That's it.
0	the selected score ends abruptly even though it completes the time allotted in the menu for purchasing. A disappointment that I didn't expect.
0	while I like the arrangement and the idea of this version, the main vocal is desperately melodramatic and ultimately ruins it..
0	Has to be free.  Not many people would want to buy it.  I was suppose to get a free song after I ordered some CD'S.  If I knew it was this one I wouldn't have bothered.
0	Nothing but noise, don't waste you money. I'm a NIN fan but I was really pissed off.
0	I bought this based on the great reviews and all the awards. Wow. Not too sure what the hype is all about. The character voices were so so annoying--I can't imagine listening to this multiple times. Then it jumps wildly from topic to topic. Galileo to Fibonacci sequences to magnetism and Mozart and so on in lightening speed. Nothing is covered well, just quickly, again in those annoying voices.  The worst part for me, though, was the whole reason I bought the CD--I wanted some good skip counting songs. Holy cow. It is the most awkward, contrived, forced sequence you can imagine. It's set to Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, and I wish I could sing it for you to show you just how weird the 2's are. Then it skips to sevens and omits the number 28.  I wish I'd saved my money.
0	poor guy
0	Wow!!! What a complete let down. I'm a Floyd fan, have ALL their albums.  This is four sides of sound effects. Sounds like a b-movie soundtrack. I've never paid for a double album and had all four sides be half utilized.  If these guys are done musically, and they are, they don't need to be duping fans and selling this nonsense.  Holy COW man!! Total crap.
0	Are saxophones unknown in The Ukraine?  They must be given the lack of them in this rendition of Josef Holbrooke's "Children of the Don".  Either that, or Maestro Penny is one of those conductors who thinks it not a problem to alter a score not written by himself.  The full orchestral score calls for a section of FIVE saxophones (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Baritone, and Bass).  This is actually somewhat common in Holbrooke's larger-scale works.  Holbrooke wanted the sax section to re-inforce the wind section by adding a deeper, reedier, and somewhat edgier sound to the ensemble.  Naturally, this effect is not had in this recording.  The score itself contains much in the way of late-romantic, eminately listenable music.  The effect, unfortunately, is marred in several places by not adhering exactly to the composer's intentions.  Hopefully, a much better recording will one day appear to offset the shortcomings of this one.  If you are a huge fan of Holbrooke, then perhaps this recording would be considered better than nothing; if you are a student of orchestrational technique in addition to liking Holbrooke's music, then I would say that it would be better not to waste one's money on this CD which is essentially done by a less-than-first-rate ensemble and conductor.
0	As of this date I can not find this on either my phone or Kindles. I had to buy the CD.
0	Skips every other bar. Need a real black vinyl version
0	I love this album, but this gets 2 stars. It would be great if one time I would get a record from Amazon that didn't skip at all. Last two I've purchased have had bad skipping spots.
0	not what I thought it would be.
0	I value this box set quite a bit -- file under guilty pleasures -- but Vol. 4 is only, well, 1 of 4 CDs in this set. Shouldn't even be listed on Amazon because it is incomplete...
0	downloaded only partial download.  Would not play.  This process is very dificult to near impossible to make it work.
0	I truly did not want to believe that this was one of my beloved favorites, Rick Springfield murdering each and every song on this album, but a person can only go so far on denial. In my case delusion didn't even make it through the first track, and by the time I trudged on through to the end I only got really, really sad.  I didn't know that Rick could suck.  This album is a massacre. It should be taken away, hidden, and hopefully forgotten.
0	I've never even heard this recording. The process for downloading & playing is ridiculously complex. I will not be purchasing anymore music from you.
0	The CD was very boring, the only "okay" song was the first one. My girlfriend is a DIE HARD Jessica Simpson fan and she listened to it one time and hasn't touched it since.
0	Awesome, awesome and a blessing
0	I noticed that almost every band on the radio sounds alike. All rap sounds alike. All diva-pop sounds alike. And all radio rock sounds alike.  I decided to download the "How You Remind Me/Someday" mp3 onto my computer for the fun of it, and I was laughing. Both songs have the same BPM, the same chord changes, wow, and I thought Creed was terrible enough.  The rest of the CD isn't any good either. "Because Of You" sounds like something ripped off Metallica's "St. Anger", and "Figured You Out" has some of the most mundane lyrics ever.  Nickelback's new album, "All The Right Reasons", hits stores really soon. Expect one of the songs to sound exactly like one of their older songs. Nickelback is a joke and a disgrace to Canadian music. Hopefully they will realize how terrible their songwriting skills are and retire from the music business.
0	Ehhh, first two songs are great. I love his music that I can dance to. This album is more sexy Marvin Gaye than it is for dancing.  Not my favorite.
0	did not order this item
0	These songs were only usable by the owner.  I tried to transfer it to my wife's portable device but it won't let me.  It was purchased for her.
0	I was excited about this new release.  Sadly, the majority of it is a bunch of poseurish mumbly. It makes you want to find the band and kick their ass for moping so much about nothing. Go do some volunteer work or something productive in society, I wanted to scream at them.  I really liked the first album.  I only like the graphic of this album, and maybe the song "Angel".  That is all.
0	It is ok just not the same with out Sammy Hagger
0	cant stand her but my wife likes her
0	After "Getz/Gilberto" the second best selling Jazz album of all time behind "Kind of Blue", the record companies were anxious for another golden egg.  However this is one of the worst periods in Stan Getz life, the 70's. Personal problems, and he was locked in the the bitterest divorce case in history, went to the Supreme Court! Things added to his orange juice...  Joao Gilberto also has a good reason to have a grudge against Getz but it doesn't show here, he is as mellow as usual. A trooper. His singing and guitar & Heloise hold the day, while Getz pretty much phones it in. What's good on this album comes from him.  For better Getz, pick any other decade or his life. For some reason all of the Getz Columia recordings are really bass thin and harsh. This one is less so, but no exception.  See my list for many better Getz recordings.
0	Whoever put together the streaming managed to leave out several movements of several symphonies. i.e. the title of the set is misleading.
0	The baby crying thoughout the song completely ruins it. I have yet to find a version of this song on iTunes that doesn't have the baby. Very frustrating.
0	Bought this to get one song off of  the mix.  Unfortunately, the songs are sped up; so if you want the original timing, you won't get it here.
0	This was so difficult to get that l never did accomplised the download. Kept taking me to different things l had to download. Will not use again!
0	This is the wrong ong going to return this,as soon as I can I have been Ill, and my daughter did not like it .
0	This is the epitome of what's wrong with film music today: it's bland, boring, forgettable and, while it fits the film is an utter bore to listen to isolated from the film. The Terminator Genisys score sounds a great deal like Lorne Balfe listened to the original scores, namely Brad Fidel's, jotted down a couple notes, included some very weak reference and then filled up the rest of the score with a Hans Zimmer-style soundtrack of synth noise. With tracks like "Sarah and Kyle" it sounds like its trying hard to find a theme or a melody but completely failing. I can leave a film scored by John Williams and remember themes and melodies clearly, but with this soundtrack, there's, well, there's that song that went "dah-duh...." then had some noises and booming chords and drums and, was there a theme in there somewhere?
0	Record was extremely warped. The warping is so bad it sometimes causes the music to cut out.
0	I bought the cd based on one song that featured Joss Stone. It just happened to be the only song on the album that I liked. I had already download the song before ordering. I could have saved my money for something/ anything else.
0	Any recording of PROMISES, PROMISES should come with a warning not to listen to this score unless you want these lethally contagious tunes and beats buzzing around in your head for weeks afterward.  That said, I personally much prefer the original cast recording, originally on United Artists Records, and one of the few released on that label.  Like many revivals the performances here are mostly fine technically but somehow lacking a certain feel and je ne sais quoi. Sean Hayes has a pleasant voice but with an annoying vibrato (wobble) on sustained notes. Kristen Chenoweth is pretty much note-perfect - after all she does easily toss off the fiendishly difficult "Glitter and be Gay" from CANDIDE - but the bouncy (and deceptively simple) Bacharach/David mode seems a little stiff in her deliveries.  I admit to favoring the mellow, expressive baritone of Jerry Orbach, one of my favorite Broadway male singers, and especially the unique, slightly countrified soprano of darling Jill O'Hara on the original original cast. There is also a loose, effortlessly swinging,(and authentically Bacharach) feel to the original orchestra sound which seems lost on the by-the-numbers instrumentalists of today. (But this is a very fine point).  The unnecessary additions to the score have already been mentioned here.  I was pondering how to discreetly describe the source of "A House Is Not A Home" but it's already here, it was from a film about a whorehouse. But when you think of it, isn't that something akin to what the lead guy here is doing with his apartment?
0	Love Muse and been a fan for about 15 years. In my opinion this is their worst and most generic album to date. Disappointed based on how they promoted it and described getting back to their hard rocking/raw roots.
0	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!  This is a remastered version of "Nevermind" and it is HORRIBLE.  The sound of Nirvana that was on the original "Nevermind" album that was perfectly mastered and perfectly produced by Butch Vig and recorded at Sound City DOES NOT exist on this recording.  All of the songs are missing the original sound that made this album great.  Remastering this album is just like someone going back and remastering the original Rage Against the Machine album that was also recorded at Sound City.  If it is PERFECT, don't screw with it!  You can't beat PERFECTION!!  Music recorded at Sound City on the very rare NEVE console using tape and actual talent are VERY FEW.  Please, Please, Please, SAVOR them as they are supposed to be savored.  Don't support a crappy remaster that is nothing like the original recording.  BUY THE ORIGINAL ALBUM!  You will not be disappointed.
0	I bought the song because I made a music video but it was easy to the track this song so is banned from cell phone usage so no 1 could watch my music video on their cell phone.
0	This is the greatest damn thing ever.  If you are a stuck up person who is appalled that a Broadway musical can be put together with rap overtones,  just don't purchase this and go purchase a Nickelback album.  If you are on the fence and checking the single-star/complaints and trying to determine if you should drop a pair of Hamiltons for this, just do it already.  You are not likely to be disappointed.  (Really a five-star review)
0	Terrible quality, GREAT SONG.  Bass is messed up like everywhere else on the internet, only this song.  I don't think a good quality one exist anywhere, what an absolute tragedy.
0	This could have been good but the quality of the CD was crappy.  Skipped, was all garbled and piece of junk.  I usually don't have this problem so I didn't save receipts or anything to return it.  I will just NOT purchase from here again.
0	only a few of the tracks are worthwhile.
0	I feel really bad that I do not like this album. I have all of his other CDs and practically wore them out playing them over and over. However, I just do not care for this one. Too loud, too fast, too jarring, screaming, overdone vibrato are words that come to mind. He drowns out the background music. I do not find it relaxing to listen to this collection of songs. There are one or two songs that I like, but I find the rest just irritating to listen to.
0	Poor audio quality  request refund.
0	Not all piano as I had expected. Orchestras , comos , etc included
0	Josh Groban made one of the worst mistakes of his professional life, by selecting a collection of songs that doesn't fit his voice or his style. He and his fans deserve better
0	Very disappointed - not the version from the movie - this version is very disco
0	This was some useless version with a bunch of crap that had nothing to do with the original song. Frankly I was cheated!
0	I remember, when you use to play shoot them up bang bang baby baby!  Owww, that is another intruder song I cannot get enough of.
0	Not really my cup of tea, this isn't my favorite genre or something I typically listen to.  Better off buying some Tech House.
0	This would be a wonderful album, except the mastering job sucks. None of the songs have and treble whatsoever. It all sounds so muddy. Go get PIGMATA, the remastered version. It has THREE bonus tracks in addition to a wonderful remastering. Don't support this "grand recordings" company. It's a joke. Go get PIGMATA and support Raymond!
0	NEVER DID RECEIVE IT AND SO I COULDNT REALLY GIVE YOU A GOOD COMMENT ABOUT IT ABOUT THE PRODUCT WHEN HAVENT TRIED IT
0	this is garbage!!!!!
0	First I have to say I love the music; I have heard it all on my i-Phone.  I ordered the CD to hear it in my home via my CD player.  Yes, I have an older CD player.  Here's the problem: the CD has a bar code on its identifying top side.  I have never seen a CD with a bar code on it.  That being the difference between the subject CD and the other 150 CDs I play, I have to believe that the bar code is responsible for the fact that it will not play at the unit for which it was purchased.  I think it is AMAZing that AMAzon doesn't understand my complaint.  For the first time ever - I am not happy with the CD nor am I able to contact the singer or her company unless of course I join FACEBOOK-but that won't happen.  MMH
0	The package did include two vinyls. Unfortunately they were BOTH side C/D but no side A/B. Sad, as it was bought as a Christmas gift.
0	I liked this song just fine at first. But what's the deal with the bassline? I had it playing and I thought I blew my speakers, until I realized it was just the way the song sounded. Now, I can't get it out of my head, and it has ruined my enjoyment of the song.
0	This is a free sampler of relaxing music from a variety of sources.  If you are looking to find difference types or sources of relaxing/meditating music this may be helpful.  It is not relaxing in itself as the music keeps changing every 3 to 5 minutes.
0	Loved MC Lars albums, but this collaboration with K. Flay didn't really work for me. If I wanted to listen to songs about fame and sex and parties, I wouldn't be listening to Lars. But most of the songs on this album are drawn on "traditional" hip hop themes -- that is, fame and sex and parties.  Somebody's Watching Me is a fantastic song, and I wish the rest of the album was like it.
0	i used to like this song a little bit, but then it got really overplayed and it got really annoying.
0	Great first dance song for someone who loves it
0	meh
0	First of all, I must stress, do NOT buy this CD at all costs. If you're really curious as to how terrible this band is then I recommend you just download their music for free somewhere. So, where to start? Well to be honest there really isn't that much to say because this album left so little of an impression on me that pretty much every aspect of their "music" can be summed up in a few sentences. The vocals are just talentless whining, although in that respect they suit the lyrics perfectly since they too are devoid of any talent, emotion or imagination whatsoever. As for the instruments, it's a mix of attempts at gothic and electronic pop; failing at both. The use of instruments is simply unmemorable, repetitive and mind-numbingly boring. While the incredibly biased Editorial Review for this album does shows a minuscule amount of honesty by admitting that the piano melodies sound like they are being played by a child; it would have to be a child who has just started to learn how to play the piano with no knowledge of how to compose a song. I can't pick any favorite tracks as all the songs are horrendous, so instead I'll tell you which songs were the most horrendous: 10%, Mars, Believe, Wendy's Razor Blades, Legion and You're My Disaster.  The biggest crime about this is that the band is actually trying to get people to hand over their hard earned cash so that unsuspecting listeners will force their ears to endure this torture. So there you have it! "Versailles - Broken Dolls", a vacuous excuse for music occupying the lowest depths of the underground music industry; and forever will it stay trapped there.
0	Oh, Rod Stewart, what's happened to you? I miss the Rod Stewart of yesteryear - the rocker, party-animal and bad boy who gave us such hits as "Hot Legs", "Rhythm of my Heart", "Forever Young", and "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy." Now we're left with a cover artist who's traded in everything that made him a star and appealing who churns out albums full of cover songs of old American classics. "Fly Me to the Moon ... The Great American Songbook Volume V" is really not that different from the first four albums of the American Songbook series. For one album, the one where he covered classic rock songs, there was a hint of the old Rod Stewart but now we're back to this crooner imitation that Stewart's been playing with for the past few years.  In listening to this album, I wanted to break down this review by tracks. Then I realized that there really was nothing great to say about the individual tracks on this album. I will start off by saying one good thing: thank goodness the music of this release is more upbeat and overall happier than the tracks chosen for the other songbook volumes. That simple change of going for the most swing/upbeat orchestral arrangement of the songs makes "Fly Me to the Moon" stand out in the series.  Now, for the bad news. My problem with "Fly Me to the Moon" and the other four volumes of this American Songbook series is that it is really lacking in Rod Stewart. I'll explain. I get it - as artists get older, they want to change or do something differently musically. This thing of covering old American classics, however, has been dragged out entirely too long in my opinion and is truly killing the musical legacy Rod Stewart made. These tracks are nothing more than high profile karaoke. Where's the feeling? Where's the emotion, the spark that makes you nod your head in appreciation of the sentiment and emotion; the unique spin that makes you feel like you're listening to Rod Stewart? This album, and the others of this American Songbook series are pretty annoying and disappointing because every track is sung almost entirely the same as the next. There's no real emotional exploration going on or personalization happening. To me, the tracks sound very similar and therefore feel uninteresting because it feels like Rod Stewart or his record company realize they'll make money with him being a cover artist either way and he's grown very comfortable not investing himself into the music or songs because they're already familiar to most of his audience.  This feels like a lazy effort from Rod Stewart with no real creativity or talent being exhibited. There are a few tracks worth listening to: "Moon River," "Sunny Side of the Street", "Fly Me to the Moon" have traces of the old Rod Stewart but still, I find it hard to believe that the once rocker Stewart who in interviews likes to to point out how he doesn't feel old or irrelevant has gone from being such a stand out artist to being nothing more than a good cover artist. I'd like to have heard a few original tracks mixed into this album; we haven't been treated to truly new, original content from Rod Stewart in years and I believe all of this covering of the American classics he's done over the years has made him a bit weak as an artist because he's singing every song with the same emotion and tone and is showing little range. I say skip this. It's really not anything new or anything unique worth throwing your money at.  Listen to These: "Fly Me to the Moon," "Sunny Side of the Street," "Moon River."
0	I love Ghost, but this LP has skipping issues and there's nothing worse than new vinyl that skips.  The Popestar record is fine, but the Meliora record is awful with skips.  I've tried 3 different ones and the skips are always in the same place - the manufacturer should be ashamed of itself for taking money for this awfully produced record.  EDIT: I should update that I upgraded my setup from the low end Audio Technica turntable to a Pro-ject Debut Carbon, and it doesn't skip any more. Just on the cheap table.  So I don't know what you're running, but it's gonna be hit or miss - if you look this release up on Discogs you'll see there's a history of skipping.
0	Such a basic  generic sound.
0	Purchased because I like the duet with John Legend, didn't realize most of the other songs had vulgar language!
0	In one word the way to describe this album is "Generic". I'm not saying I didn't like it but honestly they lost track of who they really are. We came as romans is supposed to be a symbol of hope and originality for the music industry, but they completely sold out themselves for this album. Remember their past albums? How they had long songs which usually incorporated awesome instrumentals with technical sounds that just were plain bada$$. But with this album they hardly use any technical sounds and the lyrics make for generic crap you would hear in a three days grace album (not a diss, just a fact they have generic lyrics). I saw an interview where they talked about how the producer of this album made them scrap all their work and make 30 new works (which only 10 made it on.. Seriously...10......). Since when did this band listen to others on what their music should sound like? They dropped the ball with this album despite the few songs which I enjoyed.
0	I was disappointed in the music.  I had never heard some the songs on the album and most of these weren't very good.  I only recognized 5 of the songs.
0	Can anything be worse than Justin Beiber's "Baby Baby"? YES!  This is seriously the worst crap I've ever heard.  It's completely beyond my comprehension how anyone can stand listening to this rubbish let alone actually claim to like it.  Frighteningly, unbearably bad.  Lame, uninteresting, unmemorable, and sophmoric melodies.  Don't waste your money.
0	Man, the roasting fire sound is very annoying. I deleted it after 5 minutes listening to it.
0	the two songs i really wanted  to hear aren't on it; what a waste of money; is the other music good? sure, but the missing songs make it a big disappointment.
0	the bitrate isn't 320!!!!!eeeewwwww LIKE THIS SHOULDN'T EVEN BE LEGAL! ::puke::
0	Just... Just no. His music is so bad it is pathetic. Similar beats in every song, lackluster and blatantly obnoxious vocals, and horrible lyrics is all you'll find here, ladies and gents. Trust me; it's so bad it isn't even humerous.  Please, PLEASE don't encourage him.
0	Guarantee that you will remove it after a few spins. Now any one can relaese a CD. For $.99 people take chances. I listened to the 2 songs 3 times before deleting from playlist. Stream it don't buy it..
0	Good buy from Amazon.
0	Lol really ? Chad rapping skills is bad smh and Gabe did ok but she was holding back singing i wish she had more strength in her voice and was more confident singing the song The reason why i rated it a 2 was because it did not live up to the hype i thought they was going to kill the song but it fell flat it needs work ...my honest opinion
0	this wasn't the version I was looking for and although it is a great song, the extended more musical version is a lot more fun.
0	I love this song, but the Amazon music app won't play it or save it to my phone.
0	This is the 6 plus min long version, which begins with a bunch of stupid chimes or something, instead of the redic sax I demand from a rendition of careless whisper. I didn't know! I regret my purchase! What will I use for a phone ringtone now?
0	Not original recording don't like changes
0	I have thoroughly enjoyed TSO's previous releases.  The music was stirring, had original arrangements, and featured well sung and well written lyrics.  However this new album just falls flat in every category.  First off, the instruments (especially the drum kit) sounds like they were programed on a Korg Triton keyborad. There is no way you could convince me that the strings on the album were studio recorded, something I would expect from the a band that hires out an orchestra at every concert!  Then the songs, so incredibly repetitive that they bore me and I find myself skipping ahead in the album.  The vocalists sound like they are trying to bring emotion into these emotionless songs so I can't fault them for making the attempt.  About half the songs sound like I've heard them before.  The whole thing just seems like it was rushed through but we've been waiting for 5 years for this.  I'm completely disseminated and I'm now just hopeful of something better in the future.
0	Kind of annoying.
0	First of all, there's a reason why these guys were back up vocalists and not lead vocalists. Second, six or seven (or more) of the songs Elvis never performed live and probably didn't even fool around with in the studio. Now the band is good, but what they have to work with is not much and even worse. And third, J.D.'s glorification and denial of Elvis' addiction to opiates (essentially Elvis was a herion addict who used demoral and other powerful narcotics in pill form and injections) is beyond naive.  It's people like Mr. Sumner that aided in Elvis' decline and eventually his death by enabling and caretaking. Not that Elvis doesn't share the blame. Addiction and alcoholism have at their roots selfishness and self-centeredness and he was told by more than one person to clean up and because of his delusional state, refused to clean up. I suppose it's difficult for someone to hit bottom when he has a host of "friends" who aren't willing to tell the truth to him and when you make $100,000 for an appearance that certainly doesn't seem like someone who has hit bottom.  Anyway. The album is tedious, monotonous, and J.D.'s bass gets incredibly irritating, particularly when he's trying to defend Elvis and his drug usage problem which Mr. Sumner never really believed Elvis had, even until Mr. Sumner's death. For those who have to have anything connected with Elvis, it make a nice display in your record collection, otherwise I expect you won't bother listening to it more than 1/2 a time.
0	Never got it to download.  Have purchased it two or three times and still can't get the damn thing to download.  Even tried a different browswer.
0	I pre-ordered this months ago... I was excited when it arrived and then it left me flat. This band has talent, in their last release they proved it with original lead vocals and solid guitar work in songs like Whatever Haunts You, Big Enough and Mean B***h. If you are looking for that same edge, you are not going to find it in Stay Golden. Maybe they can pull the magic back for the next release.
0	I was very excited about this Passport to Identity idea and really looking forward to doing this with my daughter. However, as I prepared for the weekend and listened to the audio beforehand I realized that the content was not exactly what I had in mind. I was expecting the content to be focused on teaching our teens about our identity being rooted in Christ and not in what the world says, but the focus of this entire weekend is not her identity in Christ alone, but her identity as a woman based on FamilyLife's interpretation of what it means to be a woman. It is all very gender based. Even though they have very good life examples and stories of Godly teenagers, they make it a point to emphasize that the actions of that teenager characterize a Godly woman and is specific (restricted) for women, when in reality all their stories and principles are true for any Godly PERSON, whether male or female. For example, when they talk about being a helper and having the heart of a servant, they restrict this quality as being a characteristic that God created in women, when it should be a characteristic that all followers of Christ have. The bottom line is that this whole set is not meant to teach your teenager about having her IDENTITY IN CHRIST but her IDENTITY AS A WOMAN  that follows Christ; for me, there is a huge difference between these two and I would rather teach her TRUE Godliness and not what gender-specific-ideas of what Godliness looks like. They should change the name from Passport to Identity to Passport to Womanhood to make it more accurate.  PS. I also bought the passport to identity for young men for my husband to do with our son and listened to some of the audio to compare the teachings. Well, the boys' version is even worse. It goes to the extreme of saying that a young girl's role when she grows up is to be married and find great joy in serving as her husband's helper and supporter! -Forget the fact that many girls will grow up and glorify God in their singleness, like the children's pastor in my church. Oh, poor children's pastor! She has no purpose in this world and is defying God by not fulfilling the role God intended for her: to marry and find joy in being her husband's helper. And for us who do get married, our sole purpose is to support our husbands, not to minister to the poor and orphans, the unbelievers, not to make disciples and expand the Kingdom of God; no, we weren't made for that; we were made to help our husbands while they go and do that! It's so ironic how on they girls' version they teach the girls that there's so much they can do for the Kingdom within their "womanhood" limits and on the boys' version they say that girls' were specifically made to be their husband's helper, that's all they were created for. Wow!
0	loved her last cd. did not like this one.
0	I really looked forward to this album expecting progression from the first one I accidentally bought in Columbus GA and ended up loving to queue up on my iPhone on those long flights to SFO.  However, this album has little of the energy and emotion that stood out in the debut.  It comes across to me as trying to be too clever rather than just laying it out there as the group did in the original.  I should see it performed before passing any final judgement because the studio could be what killed the performance.  With the NYT gushing all over the band they will get past this second act and hopefully have the runway to survive two years for part three.
0	As in her first collection Susan Boyle's singing on The Gift is excellent.  Her voice is soft and melodic.  Whoever compiled the arrangement must like loud music because it completely overpowered her singing.  I bought it to play as I traveled and found that I had to keep one hand on the dial to adjust the level up and down - not a good idea when traveling.  Her first song began so softly that I had it turned way up; then the music came in at full blast.  An orchestra of that power and a choir singing loudly are too much.  I buy her CDs to hear her voice not that of an orchestra or choir.  She could sing a cappella and it would be beautiful on its own.  Hopefully any future compilations will not make this mistake.
0	It would be great if the songs were listed. I don't wanna make a blind purchase.
0	This CD is imported from Russia.  The "Plays Pretty Just For You" seems to be a valid stereo version of the original album.  "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?", however, is a mess.  It is not in stereo, and only contains approximately 25 minutes of the original 35 minute album.  All selections are incomplete and the "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" selection is only 4:28 compared to the original 2-part selection lasting 9:27.  A real rip-off.  The original selections from "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" are currently only available from iTunes.
0	1 is not for song itself but for the clean version which still contains the "B" word defeating my whole purpose for buying this version.
0	Who do these kids think they are?  The Beastie Boys?  Not hardly.  The Beastie Boys are talented and unique, this band is so ordinary and radio friendly it makes me ill. Sounds sorta like it should be the soundtrack for a teen movie or something.  For god's sake, please don't buy it.
0	I didn't order this! I just got charged for something I did not order and don't even know who this is. There's nothing in here to return to get my money back. Be sure to watch this sort of thing on your credit card. If Amazon charges everyone $2 for something they didn't order think about how much that adds up to per person daily in profits for Amazon. I wouldn't be so angry if there was a way to remove this, but there is not.
0	There is no sample to know what it sounds like? or What it is?  I have to put a star to submit this
0	Those people who hate Ayn Rand's ideas (pro-communist leftists and anti-abortion conservatives) or enjoy watching Jerry Springer will love this movie. Those who want the truth about Ayn Rand should look somewhere else.
0	No Comment.
0	I like the fact that Amazon is expanding out and getting more original content and not afraid to take on the music labels. I think the problem with this is that Amazon for some reason doesn't seem to know their audience, which is a HUGE miss from a company that knows everything about us.  They also seem to be slow at integrating with their own devices (I tried it on the Echo, and it doesn't work). After that I tried to play it on my Sonos, and its not there either. So I'm listening to it via my laptop, a few songs I dig, but most of the artist, I don't know and the songs are just ok.  Maybe I just have high expectations for Amazon?  I will not give it a 1 star, because I think the effort was good, there are some good tracks there, but the execution was very disappointing.
0	A freebie from our friends at Amazon.  I always enjoy a good freebie, it is a great way to try things.
0	This song never came through. I tried several times to download. I love the music of Luke Bryan. I will have to buy the whole cd.
0	not what I expected ..........
0	this has 16 shanties. the game has 35. Not including The Parting Glass, which is not in the other album either. It should take near an hour to listen to all of them nonstop.
0	Nothing wrong with it just an unwanted freebie That's all even if this wants more words I have nothing to add
0	This is one where reality kills your expectation. I am experiencing the same feeling as I did when hearing STP's post break up / reunion album.
0	I always knew French guys couldn't play Rock N' Roll and this album is proof of that. Forget about these Stooges and NY Dolls comparisons. This is terrible. The singer is the worst, guitars are weak and buried in the mix and the drums are about as powerful as the last few old maids in the popcorn popper. Looking for stuff that sounds like the Dolls and Stooges get Hollywood Brats, Silverhead, Hanoi Rocks and Smack. As far as French sounds, stick with Francois Hardy and France Gall.
0	I got cheated made me buy twice
0	Not much of a song
0	shorter song
0	Hello band mates: I have the FX Network app which has Simpson world one of my favorite cartoons and love watching every episode for multiple viewings however the app does have some flaws it tends to have the same 3 commercials during the break and one of them is for a hipster fiat car with ear bleading your annoying poppy song that makes me want to not clap my hands it makes me want to cut them off. Your band is auto tune garbage and since you " sold out " your mark on the world is being a car salesmen and ruining The Simpsons. I know you have no control on them playing your ad anytime but I just ask you please stop playing digital instruments and do some real good in life and become the best Starbucks baristas you guys can be, thank you
0	This is not the original, nor is it the sample version offered by Amazon.  This is a horrible 90's remake.
0	As a singer who loved the original cast album of this show, I was weary when I heard the casting announcements for this long-overdue revival. Sadly, my concerns were validated once I received the CD this past week. My chief complaint is with Sean Hayes. As a gay man, I can honestly say that I have no issues with casting anyone to play a part...IF they can pull it off. He has a sweet voice, but frankly, lacks the bravura and energy to be believable in this role. I also have to say that the musical direction is off the mark. I can't see from the credits who did the arrangements, but my guess is that they weren't adults in 1968 to remember the sound and feel of the original. Kristin Chenowith, as always, is first rate, although she would not have been my first choice either for her role. In essence, this was a missed (by a mile) opportunity to revive a rare and very special piece of Broadway history. Wonder what Mr. Bacharach really thinks about this version.....
0	Compared to all there other albums this one is by fare the worst.
0	DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy this version.  I have an $8000 sound system and this version sounds like it's coming from a 1960's transistor radio, I couldn't even make it through the whole song.
0	This song crush by david archuleta, is okay. I do agree it is a safe song. Alot of people don't like him not for the lack of a beatiful voice, but his image!! Who cares if he's nice, clean cut, young and old girl adored!!!! You don't need a tainted image to sell records and gain fans.  You don't need a gimick when you have talent (T-pain) take notes.  I, a R&B fan ,who like to see a little R&B on his album!!  For his strength is slow songs. Don't turn him into bubble gum pop, or bubble gum R&B. (his album producers take notes) Give us a mixture of styles, but you have to give us 4-to-5 slow songs to radiate nice voice he has. I'll give him his dues he can sing,unlike some of these artist now. who can't sing live, but can dance out of this world,fill in your own blanks please!!! I'm not saying R&B love making songs, but slow songs!!! Like elliot yamin for example!!
0	Nice art.  Marginal recording.  I find it ironic.  If you want to know why this and many other recordings sound bad ... G00GLE "Loudness War".
0	NOT GOOD! BUTTLER, GEECH, AND SHWA SOUND MUCH BETTER! LYRICS? COME ON! NO TALLENT HERE! NOT GOOD AT ALL. MMM
0	I am the biggest Killers fan - all albums I love and value the difference in them. But, be aware when you buy his solo album, sweet but almost too sweet. I understand Europe, especially the UK has a different spin on him, and he is lovely, but I was a little let down, considering he did mention that some of these tracks were meant for The Killers, and I wonder what direction and sound they would have produced with them. Secondly, I needed to hear some a mix of beats and themes in his music writing, too much one way is not enough value for entire album purchase. But luckily, this album was priced lower, and I think the label understood this and his popularity in the U.S. market, that is why you see him do more shows in other parts of the world, where he clearly has The Killers market behind him, now he really needs to get the band back together in reality. Two good songs on this album: Flamingo: Crossfire and his duo "Hard Enough" which no radio station or college alternative plays. But that is the music industry - and that is individual taste. Welcome to America and our ability to like what we like. I give it two stars, fitting for the most I found in this album. I would really love to see his solo performance to get a better perspective. Let's face it, there are so many bands out there producing and I just don't think this album was up to standards (producing) to where Brand Flowers or BR of The Killers should be. It was elementary for him and for world know record label.  Saying all that, I like the two songs and love BR/The Killers. I would to see BR solo tour and of course, I would love to see The Killers back being a band and jointly producing some great music. (ps. I spent over $15,000 in the last 4 years seeing TK and even saw them making their DVD at the Royal Albert in London, so I am fan and proud of it.)
0	Only two funky songs. The rest like an r&b romancer. Not my thing.
0	Only liked one song.  Let your hair down David make something fun and not boring.  We hear the same old traditionals every year.
0	Pushed the wrong button and somehow ordered this song by mistake so- don't mean to dis it- just trying to get it off my Amazon reviews.
0	Sony Music shortchanges Lauper by only giving her one disc (and 14 tracks only!!!!) She deserves much better, and this is what it should look like:  Disc One:  1. Money Changes Everything  2. Girls Just Want To Have Fun  3. When You Were Mine  4. Time After Time  5. She Bop  6. All Through The Night  7. Witness  8. The Goonies 'R' Good Enough  9. Change Of Heart  10. Boy Blue  11. True Colors  12. What's Going On  13. Iko Iko  14. The Faraway Nearby  15. Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)  16. I Drove All Night  17. Like A Cat  18. A Night To Remember  19. I Don't Want To Be Your Friend  Disc Two:  1. That's What I Think  2. Who Let In The Rain  3. Sally's Pigeons  4. A Part Hate  5. Hat Full Of Stars  6. Come On Home  7. Sisters Of Avalon  8. Ballad Of Cleo + Joe  9. You Don't Know  10. Fearless  11. Brimstone And Fire  12. Shine  13. Madonna Whore  14. This Kind Of Love  15. Waters Edge  16. I Miss My Baby  17. Stay  18. Makin' Whoopee (Duet With Tony Bennett)  19. You've Really Got A Hold On Me  They took 6 tracks from her debut, then they strangely take two from her second album, one from her third, two from her fourth, two from her fifth and none from her sixth! What?!! Sure it's nice to have Goonies, but no Hole In My Heart???!! Don't buy this, make your own compilation or wait until they get it right.
0	I spent every Christmas as a child listening to this album. It would bring back some good memories if it would play. $5 up miss piggy's butt.
0	Though I wasn't a massive fan of all the songs from their debut "Swan Songs," I did think that the few like "Young," "Undead," "Pain," and "Paradise Lost" were good. Still, "Desperate Measures" seems too desperate in just pushing another album...it actually includes three songs unedited from their debut, including a remix and live version of the overrated (in my opinion) "Everywhere I Go." In addition, their few covers were mediocre. I truly really only liked "Sell Your Soul," while the actually new top-of-the-list "Dove and Grenade" was very disappointing. They suddenly sound like an amateur band rather than the imposing stuff from Swan Songs. Given, Hollywood Undead is still ongoing--I don't really even consider this an actual album.  Will continue to anticipate their next REAL album.
0	Get over Elvis. The fat man's gone.
0	You can tell she was having more issues than vogue. I appreciate your vision and what you wanted as an artist, but, sometimes some things just don't go. I still love your voice and will dwnload your next album to check it out, but hope its better than this country mix tape.
0	Love Jimmy and the song but like google it didn't download into my music files.  I have never found it.  Waste of money!
0	Second purchase, still a lousy recording. Music is fantastic, composition is beautiful, but music cuts off br end.
0	Great song but sadly it won't play longer than about twenty seconds.  Most likely an issue with Amazon.
0	Great compilation of their hits.  Are a few drop-outs in the recordings, but overall a good CD.
0	If it weren't for the irritating fact that my favorite local radio station, KEXP, seems to like playing my least favorite track off of this, "We No Who U R," I wouldn't bother writing a review of this.  I like Nick Cave's musical artistry in general, that song just seems so cold and threatening, with so little redeeming value, I thought I would share my irritation at it for arbitrarily contributing to fear and making intimidation seem acceptable. The fnords are strong with that one.
0	Once again Amazon has failed to test the encoded file and there is a scratch/skip at 28 seconds. Why buy this version when there are so many others? Audio signature is also a bit compressed for a high quality mp3.
0	Downloaded MP3 of Neil Diamond African Trilogy. The MP3 is missing the last several seconds of the Original vinyl recording. The finale'  This is a defective copy of the original.  There seems to be no way to communicate this to Amazon.
0	Not enough hits! To much filler.
0	Only disc 2.  Not a complete CD.  I want to return it.
0	As a long-time fan of Steeleye Span, I was bitterly disappointed with this latest album. Many of the songs are very derivative - there are some rehashes of previous songs with different words and new rhythms. The vocals frequently sound tired; Maddy Prior hasn't lost that fantastic voice but it doesn't impress here, partly because many of the melodies just aren't catchy. My advice would be to stick to the wonderful earlier albums: they will always be a joy to listen to.
0	I feel that this music fits middle size to older children chrildren instead of little kids.
0	The only unfortunate thing about Amazon MP3 downloads is you can't listen to the whole thing before buying it.  10 seconds (or whatever it is) is usually enough to know if that is the version of the song you want, but in this case, it wasn't.  As far as I know, there are two versions of the original Dukes of Hazzard theme from the TV series; one played on a regular guitar, the other on an electric guitar.  This one is neither.  It is played by Waylon Jennings, but he throws in some extra "yeah!" gutterals here and there, and the tone and inflections used are NOT the same as either of the two original themes.  Do not waste your money.  I know it was only 99 cents, but it was still a waste.  You'd be better off holding up a microphone in front of your TV speaker and recording the theme direct from the show (if you're not tech-savvy) or using one of the multiple ways of wiring a straight TV to Computer/recorder to capture the song.
0	It doesn't play. My phone gets to this song and gets stuck.
0	Honestly not what I was expecting... about as good a this season of drag race to be honest. If you're a collector, grab it. If you're looking for substantial music, save your coins.
0	OK...downloaded this song and can't find it!  I love the darn song....just can't find it.  I haven't downloaded ANYTHING else (music wise) since this!
0	Poor song selection.  You should list songs in your ad.
0	Don,t bother with this crap. We waited a long time, and this is what we get. Check out Adriangale if you want to hear a real rock band. Guardian's time has passed.......SAD
0	Sorry but I don't like this. My friend gave me this as a present. I never heard of this person before but she told me I wold enjoy it, but I didn't. I have heard better Christmas albums. This is just plain awful.
0	extremely poor quality
0	did not like it. glad i did not pay any thing for it . will hope for better music later.
0	loved Jethro Tull but this was not one of my favorites not even sure why I chose to buy it
0	although a nice album musically, these mp3 tracks i downloaded were of poor quality, probably recorded from an old vinyl record. all tracks had clicks and pops, while some had actual hisses and skips! i know there are better quality albums out there because i have one of them.
0	Wow, another album from BRMC where they cannot decide what kind of music they want to make: Rockers or slow, drawn out (and IMO dull) folk songs.  I really liked WAR MACHINE & AYA.  Those I bought and enjoyed.  I'll be glad to never hear any of the other tracks ever again :)
0	I BOUGHT THIS CD 'CAUSE I LOVED THEIR FIRST ALBUM, HOT FUSS. YOU'LL FIND 3, MAYBE 4 GOOD SONGS IN THIS ALBUM. I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY, 'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT.
0	Im a real hip hop head. The beats go hard, but Rick Rock lyrics doesnt. I was really dissapointed in this CD. Rick Ross went commercial
0	I purchased this song but never saw it in any kind of library and therefore was never able to download it. Would someone help me?
0	The second part of the dvd just kept pixelating while it was running. I have the vhs and plan to just have that copied as this was a large waste of money.
0	Let me preface this review by saying I love the song Lowdown By Boz Scaggs. However three minutes and 28 seconds into the song there is a beep. It is distracting and ruined the song for me. I am (for the first time) very unhappy with my digital purchase!
0	While the song is good, it's not the version on the radio.  I'm really getting sick and tired of some of these bands putting their "clean" versions on the radio where kids hear (and then want) them, but not selling a clean version for you to buy.  Either quit swearing, or start selling clean version (which is only beneficial to the artist, so what gives?).
0	Sounds like Rufus Wainright.  Okay CD, though. Very interesting lyrics.
0	Case was cracked....
0	This is not the original lineup. Kelly Hanson has replaced the original lead singer Lou Gramm and sadly it shows. I'm the first to admit that I'm not a hugh fan of the group but do enjoy some of the hits that were played on the radio during the 80's...that said I was looking to add these "hits" to my music collection and mix them into my playlists. I also admit I bought this disk because of the $5.00 price tag. I thought I would get in cheap and plug the hole in my library for a song...sometimes you get what you pay for...The minute I heard the vocal on "Feels Like The First Time" I knew something was wrong. The band was right but the vocal mix was off to where I finally looked at the cd case and and found the small print...Brand New Recordings Of Foreigner's Greatest Hits...sadly it's just off enough to make it unlistenable...I have to agree with other reviewers who like me are a little confused as to why they would release this record...Journey replaced their lead singer and only play the hits in concert...if Foreigner wants to remain a working band they need to write new songs and sell them as such...bands like Deep Purple, The Allman Brothers & Lynyrd Skynyrd (to name a few) have all had personnel changes yet they moved forward and made new music to the enjoyment of old & new fans alike...sorry Foreigner but this cd will be traded in at Rasputin Records and that money will go toward "Foreigner:Complete Greatest Hits" issued by Rhino Records at least I'll know I'm getting what I payed for...
0	I bought tis for my son who is a music major.  He loved it
0	The album is great. The sound quality of the vinyl pressing was made for crosley, and sounds like isht. Oh well, at least it looks cool in white
0	I Love two songs off this CD 24 Karat Gold and Lady. Lady is Stevie Nicks at her best. Powerful and touching. The rest of the songs are ok. Ill be honest. For me, Its her voice. Some of the vocals are cringe worthy and embarrassing. I've been a fan of Stevie Nicks for 35 years. I'm devoted and love her. I was always pleased that she didn't use auto tune. She should have on these songs it would have made a world of a difference.
0	I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish with this album but it doesn't work. I understand that bands evolve, but how a band that is so acoustic/folk driven who has uploaded countless videos of themselves harmonizing by creeks and forests to the tune of two guitars evolves to this is a mystery. This effort represents nothing of the band who released their first two albums. It honestly sounds like an overproduced 80s album with no heart. I had hoped that we would get another Rivers and Roads, or Lost in my Mind, or 10,000 Weight in Gold, but no such luck. I guess I can just be happy we got those albums at all and hope this band some day returns to its roots.
0	This generation of music will appeal to an audience that will believe any kind of crap. Nothing here is genuine or special just another attention failed hollywood star.
0	Very disappointed, sounded like one big long song, would not recommend it
0	Ok, so it ultra new age and designed for meditation, etc.  It still doesn't work for me but that may be just personal.
0	Was not what I thought I was buying.
0	Handful of songs, with lots of people talking in between tracks. buy the individual songs instead
0	ok
0	I ordered this CD thinking that there would be at least 10 songs on it. There are three. Two are the same. What a disappointment. I could have downloaded them from ITunes for far less.
0	As a Guy listening to this is a bit like cats scratching your face. Listen to my sage advice: Boyfriends and girlfriends just need common sense and communication, but this song is for those "Mangina's" who hate themselves, and guys who never are able to disagree with their leader, the Gal in their life. AS far as the song, it's a better country cong, all country and oldtime music can wax a bit satirical and humorous.
0	Dr Dre is delighted, fans are joyous, and Curtis Jackson`s ego is beginning to expand.  But as 50cent continues to captivate universal Hip-Hop audiences, I am finding it rather difficult to control my frustration!  It is always cheering when a real raconteur stampedes the stage, but once again, I am left wondering what is it exactly that has evoked the mournful revolution in Rap.  The "Next 2Pac", has just began performing his implement, releasing a platinum album and to create the biggest buzz in the world of Hip-Hop.  But unfortunately, the enigmatic withdrawal of intelligent lyrics on POOR LIL RICH is just a brief exemplification of every other track on the album.  The litany of references to violence becomes tedious, (WHAT UP GANGSTER), (IF I CANT), (BLOOD HOUND), and (DONT PUSH ME).  In those final hours of uncertainty, (WISH DEATH), once again fails to duplicate the prophetic style of so many others in the past.  As his devouring passion for weaponry becomes the leitmotif in this LP, the obsession has led Rap music into the most self-destructive calamity ever known!  And those dispatched to the world of meaningful lyrics outpost will not enjoy the radio-friendly hits (IN DA CLUB) and (P.I.M.P.).  If only 50Cent wrote his lyrics as ambitiously as he strives to appear on television adverts!  Instead of a more pragmatic approach to solve his problems, it seems 50cent believes a combatitave one is the answer, (BACK DOWN).  Buy this album if you are entertained by incessant bragging and meaningless lyrics, but otherwise do you utmost best to avoid!  Sometimes it makes you believe Rap music can not get any worse than this, (until you hear Will Smith)!
0	worse song ever
0	I always loved this song. I had no clue that the vocals would be different on the greatest hits version than in the original. They just don't have the original punch. Its ok, just not what I wanted. I went back and got the original.
0	Unfortunately, I cannot download  this song onto my itunes so I need to go through Amazon's music each time I want to listen to this song. Otherwise, the song is absolutely wonderful to dance to, my husband and I dance the rhumba to this great song.
0	i bought but it never download to my kindle.. very upset about that.. and i really want this sone to listen to
0	This album is the biggest rip off of the Enigma that I think I've ever heard.  It does not contain any Enigma songs except for 1 and that one I'm not completely sure of.  The other other songs are by other artists with the titles changed and a lot of noise added in to make it look unique.  I wouldn't buy this album at all if I were you.  I do not own it myself, just heard some of it on an internet radio station.
0	Taylor Swift, to paraphrase Simon Cowell on William Hung, can't sing. She "talks" her way though in a monotone style with lyrics that sound like they should be in a high school soap opera. Red is no exception and, quite frankly, I am amazed at how long this "gig" has lasted. What I object to most--and she's not the only one--is the commercialization of country music by fluff artist who are not singing country music , but are perverting the genre. I mean, can you imagine George Jones or Merle Haggard singing with this gal? Taylor Swift needs to get the heck out of country and go with Britney and all the other bubble gum artists and, then, hopefully fade away like, to name a couple Debbie Gibson and Tiffany. Avoid this album and, for that matter Ms. Swift's "music" like the plague. When we lose Merle, George and rest, whose gonna fill their shoes?
0	This albulm proves you can't believe everything you read. I read rave  reviews obviously paid off by his manager. This is not a Terrible albulm  but does new justice to the term mediocre. I will take it with me on my next  trip to the used CD store.
0	Roger hits a new low here!  I guess I seen this one coming after hearing about his 4th divorce, recent negative interviews, political bashing, anti Jew/Isreal stuff, and even negative comments about David Gilmour, angry rants, and bashing Trump and others at the recent live shows.  This guy is one angry grumpy old man.  But I could have forgiven all that for a great new album after all it's only the music I really care about in the end. But tons of political stuff, F bombs, bad language, and some pretty good songs toward the beginning of the album ruined by profanity.  Deja Vu is the only song I like because at least he made that song without saying the F word 7-8 times throughout.  But it's also ironic that he talks about what he would have done had he been God (yet he's a professed atheist).  Toward the end of the album when he finally stops cursing, every song runs together (slow, generic boring numbers).  Wait For Her, Oceans Apart, and Part Of Me Died sound like the same song and stuff that could have easily been put on the weakest Floyd record The Final Cut.  After the brilliant Amused To Death 25 years ago this is what we get.  Oh well, we will always have the classic Floyd albums he helped make and a couple MUCH better solo albums!
0	I really hope somebody reviews this item because there's no information about it anywhere on the web. This is a legit item, right??
0	i am so mad!  i should have read the reviews like i usually do, do not buy this!  i thought i was getting the real songs form the real artists!  ugh last time amazon i swear!
0	what you are offering is not the Columbus Stocade Blues by Danny Davis it's I'll Fly Away. Wrong song under song title!!!!!
0	Blocked out my favorite part of the song...thought it said explicit. If I'm gonna pay $ I wanna hear the swearing. It's part of the art.
0	Awfully Bad
0	first song on cd would not play.
0	Really bad album. Styx hits a new low by hiring some heavy metal scab to ruin their sound. I can't believe people praise love is the ritual! That's without a doubt the worst song I've ever heard in my life. Everybody else lets his poision sink in, Dennis has gone to Broadway-ville, and is competing with Celine Dion for "worst adult contemporary artist" award, james is absent, and Glen stinks up the place with his awful awful songs.  I love Styx up to and including Killroy but this is too much. Avoid this.
0	It's very dull... kind of flat.  I was very disappointed as I'm a pretty big fan, and bought it unheard.  That was a big mistake.
0	How do I rate this song? Well let me see hmmm...this is pure garbage Brandy try again baby I know you can do it!
0	Good recording-great performer---Both CDs stopped producing any sound after playing them three times....You should check into who supplied them for you..
0	This is an early version, with the crummy lead in , and dinky fade out at the end. It does not sound like the radio version.
0	A SOUP SWELL OF GARNISH PLATES BETWEEN TO SHEETS OF CAR LIGHT MOBILE FUSED MENTOR SHIP OF RADICAL MARBLE FEATHER GAMES ... IF THIS DOES NOT SAY IT ALL NOTHING EVER WILL ... HEADS OR TAILS U DECIDE ! A WHITEWING REVIEW (PLEASE SEND CASH ...
0	Could not get the CD to play
0	Love Clapton, but have to question some of the song selections. Not enough Derek and the Dominos or studio versions for me of his classics. Where is Tulsa Time ???
0	DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE FAKE CDS. ITS A COPY WITH BAD SOUND AND NOISE.
0	Didn't realize it was the edited version of the album. Would not have bought it if I knew. Oh well.

0	Want to go to sleep in a hurry? Play this song which may make you want to drink a case. BEAT IT!
0	Didnt order
0	i bought this album yesterday at target. this album is terrible. there are only like three songs  i like from the album. besides dive in and the chapter 5 intro the album is a waste of money. i'm happy i only payed $12.99 for it.
0	One word to describe The Endless River: Disappointment.  I LOVED The Division Bell and I honestly thought that this would be a continuation of it (Gilmore even said so), but this is very much an instrumental album and I am a person who likes more lyrics.  I felt like it was an instrumental blend of The Division Bell and Wish You Were Here. Maybe youll enjoy it, but I listened to it once and won't be listening to it again.
0	THE MUSIC IS TOO BLAND!  I HAVE A LOT OF BARBRA'S MUSIC AND THIS CD DOES NOT FILL THE BILL FOR ME.
0	It was ok!
0	Tried to buy explicit version but if you want the cd also you can only get clean version, tried to cancel order but got stuck with unwanted clean download. Very unhappy.
0	Spektor's latest Album What We Saw From The Cheap Seats, lives up to its name.  Throughout the album I felt as though I was watching a great artist from so far away that you can't really make out any greatness.  Spektor and her producers have stated that each song on the album can stand alone "sonically."  Well, that seems to be the truth, the album does not have any cohesive composition.  When entering the studio Spektor came in with many songs from her journals and seemingly threw together a release on a whim.  The art is devoid from this artist's album, which is ironic considering the first single "All The Rowboats" conveys the plight of famous works of art held captive in museums.  While I initally thought this was struggling to be a metaphor for humanity, the lyrics do not lend themselves to that interpretation, instead Regina just sings about paintings and statues...as if she is engaging in an act of fancy singing about pictures from Better Homes and Garden magazine.  Personification should be used to make a statement not simply for the use of personification, unless of course you are only looking to sell albums or make people dance.  At times this devout Spektor fan had to entertain the two most devastating words to a true artisit...."sell out."  The best song from the album is an updated version of "Ne Me Quitte Pas" which Spektor previously released on "Songs" her second self released album.  The few songs on the album that attempt something pertinent to the human condition, such as "Small Town Moon" and "Firewood" are lost in the din of useless lyrics.
0	not to impressed
0	I had heard Left Hand Free on XM a few weeks back and really dug the raw pop sound. It was reminiscent of The Byrds or The Black Keys.  I was on my way home the other day and decided to pick up the CD. What as mistake that was, as the remainder of the album was a limp collection of soulless ambient whimp-rock. This #$%@ is going to Graywhale.
0	I expected 14 verses! I only got 4!  it would be helpful if a brief summary was given of the content so that customers can find what they are looking for before purchasing the wrong item.
0	Every song is just a rip off of a Punk-Cover that another band did better. The great thing about punk covers is that they're taking a classic song and putting a genre twist on it. The Rezidudes aren't doing this. They're taking punk covers, and just recreating the exact same song all over again. Their songs sound exactly like the Me First or Pennywise versions, except not quite as good. It's like making a photocopy of a photocopy. It's roughly the same but it's lost some quality along the way. Seek out the original punk-covers and skip these guys.
0	Probably not the album you are looking for
0	Audio is terrible
0	Amazon requires a proprietary downloader to download a simple mp3 file.  The downloader will not install on my computer so I was not able to download my purchase.
0	Not good!
0	I was searching for some more christmas music to add to my collection each year I want somethjng to play other than our Chipmunks christmas and Soulful Christmas albums. So this works. Thanks for the free music, free is always good, so no complaints.
0	I instantly fell in love with MJ 6 and 7, not the case with this, and I so looked forward to it. Not a continuous mix. Very hard to get into. Very disappointing.
0	George Mann, the pianist on this recording (which is actually part of 4-CD collection), takes on a challenge here playing short works by a variety of composers ranging from Bach to Tchaikovsky.  Sometimes he hits the mark, but often he misses.  Debussy's Claire de Lune and Dvorak's Humoresque are examples of where he is in tune with the composer's emotions.  His playing of Solvejg's Song from Grieg's Peer Gynt is at times contemplative and others whimsical.  His playing on Satie's Je te veux and Gershwin's Do It Again is pleasant.  His rendition of an arrangement for Bach's Air for the G String and Siciliano in G Minor are OK.  But, his playing of Albniz's Tango lacks fire.  While Schubert's Ave Maria can soar, Mann's performance barely leaves the ground.  His rendition of Schubert's Serenade merely scratches the surface of emotions in this piece.  His performance of Beethoven's Minuet is so wooden you forget it's a dance.  At other times, while he is playing the music, it seems he's not really there, for example, Poulenc's Nocturne, Elgar's Salut d'amour and Tchaikovsky's Andante cantabile from the String Quartet in D Major.  Perhaps I'm too critical of Mann's style of using a light touch.  But his performances, for the most part, just don't grab me.  I read one review of the collection which creditted the performances of the selections as a good background music and a inexpensive survey of a variety of pieces.  As a survey, I fear that listeners might be turned off from poor performances of good music.  As background music, OK.  But, don't pay too close attention to the performance lest the weaknesses show through.
0	Sounds like white noise
0	I don't dislike the song, I dislike the ability to edit music when it was my first time trying to purchase music for an MP3. I only needed one Lights (single version) of Ellie Goulding's song.
0	This song was purchased, it went through on my card, showed up in my library, there was a glitch on my computer and the song disappeared. I have never had a problem like this with music downloads. Hopefully this will be resolved my the song being re-added to my music downloads.
0	The pianist performing this great piece of music should not quit his/her day job!
0	FALSE ADVERTISING:  Song Time is 5:27 and NOT 7:46 as listed as of 25-AUG-2008.  I wasted 99 cents thinking I was getting an extra EP version.  Darn!
0	Nice album cover; nice piece of vinyl too but shockingly poor content.  A small group of us review new realeses every month and use a scale of 1-5 wheelbarrows (don't ask, it involved vodka). This album hovered around the 1.5 wheelbarrow mark but given we don't do halves we agreed to let it be 2 as it makes for unintrusive background music.  I've played it a number of times since our review and it simply does not grow on me. I liked their previous album and hoped they would mature with this one but actually they regressed IMHO.  I'll keep playing it because sometimes you only get an album after multiple playings but that usually applies to something that is layered, to date this one seems one dimensional.  Because reviews are so personal I'm not going to go into specific details on the banjo there or the guitar here, I suggest you buy the album and see if YOU like it. You might!  UPDATE Dec 5th:  So some time has passed and I continue to rotate this album into my 'playlist'. It just hasn't got any better for me I'm afraid.
0	some OF THE SONGS SOUND LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN RECORDED OFF OLD 45'S THAT HAD BEEN USED TOO MUCH. also SHIPPING PRACTICES ARE THE WORST I've EVER SEEN. FOR A PACKAGE TO BE SHIPPED BY MAIL FROM Maryland  AND NOT ARRIVE IN Pennsylvania FOR 3 AND 1/2 WEEKS IS JUST PURE IGNORANT ON THE SELLERS BEHALF.
0	The cd is taken from an overseas lp master tape and is not mixed for cd. This cd was made without the consent of Crosby & Nash. If you want the best sound quality, purchase the American version "Wind on the Water" (MCA - 088 112 043-2) lovingly remastered by Stephen Barncard.
0	ok though not quite as epic as i had expected. still an ok song and good buy. weird album art.
0	He gave the message out that if you want to become popular diss on a well-known artist. That already shows his ignorant talent. Can't you rap about something else than car with rims, drugs, money, and girls? He needs to go buy some education he sounds like a total MORAN when he talks with double, triple, cuadruaple negatives and uses words that are not even in the English dictionary. I grew up listening to rap oh yeah Thank you for making me feel better when I am down and come home and you are rapping about  nice cars, clothes, and jewelry that I don't even have. DONT JEOPARIZE YOUR EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU WANT TO IMITATE THIS ILLITERATE RAPPER YOU DON"T HAVE TO GO BROKE TRYING TO HAVE MORE THAN YOUR NEIGHBOOR. Don't support this garbage.
0	Couldn't play it cuz my phone lg35 optimus logic isn't compatible :-(
0	Great song, and I'm so glad it's available for non-DRM download, but this one is really pretty bad quality compared to the other songs I've downloaded from Amazon!
0	I am so disappointed in Jewel!! I own all of her other albums, her poetry, and i LOVE her. But this album is a seel out. Jewel's unique and beautiful music are taken over by a POP style, and it disgusts me. I suppose musicians do this all the time, however it's just very disappointing that one of my fave singers is a sell out. its all about the buck.
0	Very poor quality
0	Damaged front of the case. CD is okay!
0	I think the title says it all... what a ripoff, making money off of these guys (who are really nice guys, by the way).
0	This song has no place listed on any Christmas play list.  I am glad that is was the first person to listen to this song and decide whether or not to add it to our music library. Shouldn't it be safe to let their kids listen to songs on a Christmas list and not worry about if the song is sexually explicit?  Sad, now we have to worry about Christmas songs being inappropriate!
0	After listening to this song I purchased for a friend's father's funeral... all I could think was "I would hate for this crap to be played at my funeral."
0	Hollie's voice is exquisitely beautiful. That comes through on this recording, but the recording's balance ruins the effect. The grand instrumental backgrounds are questionable, in themselves, but their volume almost smothers Hollie's delicate voice. And why place a little girl's voice amidst a HUGE instrumental background? Hollie's voice contains all the drama and dynamics necessary. In visual terms, this recording is like seeing her standing at the rim of the Grand Canyon, but from a distance.  I listened only once, disappointed even for a Hollie fan or, maybe, especially because of being one. Next time, let her sing a capella.
0	Can't understand why there aren't more voices in the wilderness calling this Blurred Lines song out for what it is -- sick and disturbing.  You don't have to be religious to be offended.  You don't have to be a feminist.  You just have to be a human being with a conscience and respect for the feelings and dignity of other people.  The song is damaging not only to the women it suggests degrading and injuring but to the men who listen along and aren't offended.  For the sake of your sisters, mothers, cousins, daughters, and the way you want them treated by men -- be offended by Blurred Lines.
0	purchased for someone else.
0	There is no question that Lorde has had one of the biggest anthems from the past year with the success of her song Royals. But after that, she honestly hasn't seemed to show that she has been a strong successful songstress in the way she had shown from the beginning. Her latest song Tennis Court, the third single from her debut album Pure Heroine actually lags a bit into the drive from the heart. I just felt that the song definitely showed not to be one of her better songs. It was good at first, but honestly not as strong as Royals. It is alright, but not anything really driven. I definitely felt that this song for Lorde showed to be more of a fault than a ace from the hole. Hopefully, when Lorde comes up with a follow-up album, there will be more than just a miss on a tennis court.  Song: D+
0	In my opinion a band that cannot create new music and release the new material without surviving on past glory should retire.  It makes you think that maybe its the record label as usually the record label makes all of the money on a album/CD
0	I like Christian music.  None of that pozer Christian music like POD.  I like the soft and soothing kind.  Such as Mighty Lord, Shine Jesus Shine, and my favorite group is Sonic Flood.  What is 50 Cent does someone have bad grammer because I sure could use 50 cents to give to my loving and sharing church.  I would accept donations.  Any good sugestions about good soft Christian music? Email if you do.   God Bless You All
0	This CD features a man's voice with relaxing new age music in the background.  He goes through the usual litany of instructions...stretch the arms, the toes, the fingers, and hold for 5 seconds etc. It is actually a bit difficult to understand exactly what he is saying because the sound quality is quite poor - very muffled.  The soft music continues...I once began the CD before I got into bed because I wanted  the music to lull me to sleep but apparently the music never makes a solo appearance.  After the sleeping instructions end, it is wake-up time and the voice tells us something about getting up.  I just get out of bed and off I go.  But...coincidence or not, it does work.
0	The site does not give a listing of songs on the album, hence, I can't buy it without more information.
0	Okay. Jewel used to be human, you know? Like, the kind of person who could walk through a crowd and look normal and casual and just, herself. Now she's piled on unnecessary makeup, and is wearing clothes that everyone hate Britney for.. Just trashy outfits on Intuition though her regular tank top would've been just fine in the past. And not once in her video did she play a guitar. Hmmm... Jewel without a guitar in her lap? That's a little odd. There were a few other videos without her guitar. But... A song she sings, without actual acoustic in it? Wow that's a first, I think. I mean, what's up with that? She's gone for the clown look and for a poppy sound and [garbage], and her guitar, her naturalness, and her confidence in her doing something actually original but still being loved was what I loved about her, and that vanished in this album. I haven't heard it all. But I heard, and saw, Intuition, and I listened to a preview of some of the other songs and I'm not even going to bother wasting my money on something so fake. Pop stars die out much more easily than the original ones, I believe. I'm going to 10th grade this year and I've been obsessed fan of Jewel since 3rd grade. SEVEN years! Name some "pop" stars that last that long? I cannot think of any. She used to be totally original, and I still love her old stuff and will listen to it till the day I die, and I'll learn to play her stuff on my guitar and I'll sing my heart out the stuff that she poured her heart into. But this new stuff - she's basically asking for her career to die soon *^_^*;;
0	Got this for my mom for xmas.  when she put it in her computer to listen...japanese porn took over the screen! wth?
0	I had forgotten how annoying Byrne's voice could get.  I love all genres of music and agree with many of the comments that much of today's music and is very bland and "corporate".  But an artist doesn't have to be truly awful to stand out; Byrnes and St Vincent did just that.
0	I have been a pink floyd/Rodger Waters fan for 30 years ... I own every floyd/ water album/cd from the beginning. I hate to say this ( I really do) this CD just is not good mostly because of #1 Waters voice is gone and #2 there's nothing new  you can exchange words from pros and cons or amused with the music... It sounds like he put this together in a day and didn't care of the results. I don't like Rodger Waters music - I LOVED  Rodger Waters music and after the 3rd time of trying to find a song I like I cant ... The music its self and the musicians are good but the voice is no longer there. SORRY ALL YOU PINK FLOYD FANS (like myself) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - its better to remember the good instead of listening to this mess.
0	Can't find it on my phone
0	Streisand has already recorded the majority of these songs (some of them enduring standards she has performed to death!) featured here which are also included on her studio and live albums.  While it is mildly interesting to hear songs such as 'evergreen', 'people' and 'the way we were' sung as duets, did we really need to hear them again even though altered and reinterpreted? let's face it...all these remakes of songs sound inferior to their original versions. In my opinion it would have been far more thrilling to hear Streisand perform material she has never sung before. All of Streisand's partners on this album (except for her son) have extensive and fantastic work they have produced during their careers why didn't she choose to perform their songs instead or totally new material especially written for this album? Yes she does sing Billy Joel's `New York State of Mind' with him yet she has already covered this song which is included on one of her albums!  While there is much to say about the varying quality of interpretation of each song, I am not too sure about the awfull beyond-the-grave duet with Elvis (these virtual duets where already cheesy back in the 90's can we now just move on!); instead a duet with someone else such as George Michael for instance (amongst many others) would have been far more welcome. I am not too keen on `What kind of fool' either (the second biggest dud here!), already a fantastic classic duet unnecessarily remade here. The new arrangements don't feel right (it was originally produced as a pop song with a tempo and works better that way) and while I have great respect for John Legend, he can't compare to Barry Gibbs! And there is also something rather odd with `How deep is the ocean' being sung between mother and son or is it just me?. On the positive side, the duet with Bocelli is awesome!  I hear rumours of a duet album featuring only females which is already in progress, if so, I hope it will be better than this. Take notes Barbra!  Overall: an ok easy listening album that will appeal to most and will call for the `wow factor' only because of the famous names associated to it, Andrea Bocelli and Stevie Wonder being the highlights,(reminds me of these bad movies starring major A list actors everyone goes and see) but also a sadly missed opportunity in many ways!
0	I am a fan of Stevie Ray Vaughan but this piece struck me as something gernerated by a corporate formula for what SRV should sound like.  I would recommend Texas Flood, Little Wing, Lenny and various other SRV hits long before this one.
0	Ugh.  This album gets my vote for most overrated album ever.  While it's true that it was revolutionary and changed the face of mainstream music forever, it's still not that great of an album. The songs are extremely poppy and pleasing to the ears on the first few listens, but this gets old really fast.  How many times can a human being take "Smells like teen spirit"?  The album hasn't aged well at all, and there are and have been many, many, MANY bands with the same type of sound as Nirvana who can pull it off a million times better. Many people claim this as the album that destroyed bad hair metal and reshaped the course of rock.  "Pffft," is what I say.  The only thing this album gave us is those stupid, pseudo-angsty nu-metal bands (Staind, KoRn, Trapt, Chevelle, Seether) that are clogging the air waves and are the bane of real music fans everywhere. If you're looking for some REAL grunge/alternative, pick up Surfer Rosa by the Pixies.  This is the album that Kurt was trying to ape when he recorded this pile of dung.  Even compared to other grunge bands of Nevermind's time (Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains), the album is a joke. Don't give In Utero the skip, though.  Kurt quickly realized what a monster he'd created with Nevermind and decided to record a REAL album.  The result was In Utero.  THAT album gets 5 stars.
0	Just flat out terrible.  I love the Lips, but this album has nothing to offer artistically or even from an entertainment point of view.
0	Well, not really good actually. There are only a few songs that worth listening. They are Chariot, Follow Through and I Don't Wanna Be. The rest just didn't work for me. They just aren't catchy at all. However, if you're a fan of Gavin, Then buy this album. 'Cause i bet he put lots of effort into it, and being a bad album to me doesn't mean a bad one to you. So guys, you may give it a try. Maybe listening to sample before buying:).
0	One of the worst albums I've ever heard! No talent and unoriginal I believe she's only in the business because she's beautiful. Auto tone and poppy music can't save this one. Don't waste your dollar.
0	I found the stereo tracks dropping out and bounding back very annoying. This is not a version of the El Capitan march to I will find a place for in my playlists.
0	got this for .99 cents. about right for the quality of the music. album gets old fast. it was worth a chance for .99 cents, would not pay full price
0	It did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it. It's was a waste of my money.
0	I know I shouldn't complain,  after all it was free.  I guess I was just expecting a little bit more,  how can I put it music,
0	DISAPPOINTED. I PAID $8.95 THINKING I WAS GOING TO GET HER WHOLE CD ALBUM. IT ONLY CONTAINED THE ONE SONG "CLIMB." THE SONG IS GREAT AND INSPIRATIONAL . WISH THE CD CONTAINED MORE OF HER SONGS.
0	The song is great but when it ends another song starts and gets cut off...it's something technical I wish it would be fixed so I could get a new one..it's very annoying.
0	As George would say, " a money grab ".  Boy if George were alive today he could make a great album about our election.  It would HAVE to be a DOUBLE album.  America has sure given him material.
0	downloaded this and it's nothing but static... no music, nothing. How do I get a refund or at least the real music?
0	BARBRA STREISAND IS UNIQUE...HER VOICE IS PRICELESS...BUT THIS DUOS SIMPLY DONT WORK...THE OTHER SINGERS DO IT NICELY, BUT THE SONGS SHE SELECTED SHOULD NEVER BE "TOUCHED"..THEY ARE SIMPLY PERFECT AS THEY ORIGINALLY WERE RECORDED....MISS STREISAND...I WORSHIP YOU...BUT THIS RECORD WAS NOT NECESSARY...
0	Less than boring
0	I bought this for my Aunt because she remembered it from she was a kid and she claims she is happy with it.  I do not care for this type of "grade school" music
0	Just OK
0	The song performance is cute, but the song is very short, and the last seconds are an ad for more music. The ad ruins the song and makes it undesirable for my grandchildren. I deleted it because of the ad.
0	Come on,this is actually more than one band playing the same song over & over?Really?I almost fell asleep during the 1st sample.
0	good condition, bad music--the idea is better than the execution
0	I was disappointed in the music and lyrics. OAR may have fallen into the hands of mediocrity.
0	Rip off. There is no one song that is worth $10. plus $4 shipping fees. I don't believe Sinach authorized this fleecing of her fans. This product needs to be pulled off the market if the entire collection of song cannot be found.
0	not what i thought
0	Stills is the One holding the guitar!  And I won't even comment on the politics these guys continue to wear out.  Mr. Young, YOU, not aside!!!  "Waging Heavy PEACE"??? Come On, Man!  Blah, blah, blah -  Your acts are ALL getting OLD and wearing extremely THIN!  A lot like your hair!
0	It sounds (to me) like these are cover songs not recorded by the original artists.  Especially Bohemian Rhapsody.  I think if this is the case, it should be made clear you're buying music by cover bands.
0	I own all of his albums. I have seen him in concert twice. Do not purchase this album. In my opinion, this album is a low point in his career.
0	People, please.  This item is NOT!!! the Noel Coward derivative with Bea Lillie, Tammy Grimes, et. al.  It is a MOVIE THAT BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE to the Broadway musical.  Caviat VERY emptor!
0	David Cook is a great singer.... but i just don't like this song.... is so just not the David i love...... i hope the album have better songs.....
0	Never ordered or received this
0	Miss the hungry, creative Neil.
0	you sure this wasn't the good the bad and the ugly revisited I expected clint eastwood to come in riding a horse
0	This sucks.
0	Vinyl was warped.
0	Kool Moe Dee attracted me to this song, because in the 80s and 90s he was legendary!  Not so much anymore...
0	I ordered this record about a year ago and finally got around to getting a record player - opened the record from the plastic, took it out and found that the edge of the record was scratched/melted somehow. I had it stored in a drawer with the rest of my records and all the others are in mint condition. Since I had just opened it, I had no way of knowing it was damaged when I had first received it. Super bummed since the first 30-45 seconds of Victorious and LA Devotee are cut off/skipped. Hoping to return it and get another.  The record itself/part that works is definitely five stars. Giving it a low star rating for the damaged item.
0	Wrong song!
0	All the songs on this album are beast man. This album is their best but they don't compare to attack attack or blood on the dance floor. You wanna here good music check them outt.
0	This is not the version I've heard on the radio which has more of Christina Aquilera's voice and is far more listenable.  It was impossible to tell from the sample that this iteration of the song really isn't the one I was hoping for.  I like the Say Something I've heard on the radio much better.
0	Love ya Jen, but this wasn't a great CD !! You have an awesome voice all its own but to add as "fluffy fillers" Ludacris, T-Pain, Fantasia, And I'm Telling You, and Jesus Promised to the mix was just wrong, dead wrong.  Spotlight, We Gon' Fight, Invisible, and Stand Up are the only standouts. You'll sell a lot of CDs, but next time, stick to your voice alone.
0	I find it amazing that the Hastings myth has permeated music as well. There was nothing in his guide book about the route south of the Great Salt Lake as the song suggests. The mention in his guide of a possible route south of the GSL was in no way feasible or practical until the explorer Fremont, then Hastings himself plotted out the difficult trail that would take his name. Hastings also led over 200 people and their wagons south of the GSL and not a single person died. The route turned out not to be practical for wagon travel as a notch across the Rubies called Secret Pass could only be traversed with pack animals. This forced Hastings to take the wagons he led around the southern terminal of the Rubies adding extra miles and all but nixing the potential and practical use of the trail based on the geographic knowledge of the day.
0	Cookie Cutter Garbage, I liked that he used the singer song writer approach on the first CD, I feel he's just hopping on the R & B band wagon. We already have a Justine Timberland. Be Yourself write and sing your songs. It's been a long since I had to skip this many tracks on a CD just couldn't sit through more than a minute. On the plus side the songs that he sings are great but the Rap stuff is just terrible. Maybe he will go back to being original again. Otherwise this the last time I will waste my money on a crappy CD. Ed should take some pointers from Emerson Hart.
0	I had several of the standard released albums from this group and thought I would add a greatest hits album. I found this music Cd very disappointing. It has many of their hits (they had a few) although 'Look What They Done to My Song, Ma' is missing.  Its the sound quality that's drives this collection down. These appear to be mono recordings and as such sound flat and uninspiring. I ripped these to wave files and looked hard at the waveform with help of a computer and found nothing that would indicate these were stereo recordings. The dynamic range of the music just isn't there either.  The other issue for me in the talent level of the group. The original 'The Seekers' had Judith Durham a most talented and charismatic singer, where this group had for the most part, two girl singers but each had just average abilities and not very engaging. So with the sound quality issue and the bland vocals, I wouldn't brother with this release and as this is Oop (out-of-print)...I can see and hear why!
0	I just don't like this song. She sings weird in a few parts where she gets real loud and when you're getting into it, she scares you with her loud parts.
0	The add indicated that the seller was selling a CD and I got a cassette tape, I was sooooo disappointed. But I learned that; even if it is written it does not have to prove to be true.  However, that's all right!!!!!!!!!!! I was had.......
0	Not an official release and the sound quality is pretty bad - thin sounding/output levels really low. A couple of songs are listed out of order on the back cover. Why did I buy this thing?
0	Its a great album, Ive loved it since the release. But I purchased the vinyl and every song skips. Im severely disappointed in this order and the quality of the vinyl. I hope someone sees this and fixes this issue.
0	Not worth the money. Save it for a talented artist.
0	Not sure why Amazon music downloads don't automatically show up on my sd card anymore. Cant listen on my phone through prefered mp3 player anymore. My daughter loves the song though. Too bad I can't play it for her.
0	My teenage daughter downloaded this song on my new kindle because I wanted music.  I did not enjoy it.  It was too whiny.
0	The vinyl came curved, its difficult to reproduce
0	There is absolutely no question these guys can sing.  But they scream the lyrics of nearly every song.  I have really gotten into a cappella lately and was looking forward to this CD.  I was very disappointed.  It would be excellent if it wasn't so darn loud.  This is one CD I will pass on to someone else.
0	Was expecting much better - ended up throwing the CD away.  Couldn't stand Dylan's gravelly voice on these classics, and I AM a Dylan fan.
0	Only one of the discs in the two disc set were in the shipment
0	the song is good but the picture is inappropriate and i don't really know spanish but it is still a good song
0	didn't really like the song
0	I would have like the album to contain updated versions of the Christmas songs, but since I only paid $0.99 for it, I can't complain too much.
0	I love Soul Asylum. I like every single other one of their releases, and downright love some of them.  This cd is chock full of boring, uninspired, defeated, depressing songs that lyrically, sonically, and emotionally sound phoned in. This is the one they put out because they had to. Skip it.
0	the original has pac and val young in it where she sings the hook off michael jackson's human nature and that version sounds superior to this this is a insult lil mo what are smoking on.
0	Horrible
0	I bought this CD...and the music is pretty good....if you like Pink Floyd. But when I imported it into my itunes music library - something didn't work. The songs cut off half way through. So I get half of the songs. I am not happy. I thought that maybe I should have download the MP3 from Amazon when i bought the CD - but there does not appear to be a way to do that now, I buy a lot of music and books from Amazon - but this is leaving a bad impression.
0	According to the liner notes for "Dear Mr Sinatra" the foundation for this latest John Pizzarelli CD is "... songs that were written for Frank Sinatra...".  As a result, this premise gives us some rarer songs and eliminates the more usual suspects.  You will still find "Witchcraft", "How about You" and "Nice and Easy" amongst other familiar titles but how often do you find "Ring a Ding Ding", "I see you face before me" and "Yes, sir that's my baby" in an album these days?  But wait.  "Yes, sir that's my baby"?  That was written in 1925, and Sinatra didn't record it until 1966 - so perhaps that was not written just for him.  OK, it is the foundation for the choice of material and not a prerequisite - but if you come up with such a good idea why not stick with it?  Particularly when Sinatra was one of those few singers who really did have dozens of songs written for him.  Let me say before I go any further, I am a huge fan of John Pizzarelli, but quite frankly this latest album is something of a disappointment.  I find John more at home with a small group of instrumentalists behind him.  However in view of the choice of material it was understandable to go for the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz orchestra.  Sadly some of the arrangements (mostly by John Clayton) either seem too brash or at worse "empty".  You feel that the whole project was rushed through to the extent that I found the balance of vocal and orchestra quite puzzling on some tracks.  I can salvage a few tracks that I will play over - "Ring a Ding Ding", "I see you face before me / In the wee small hours", "Can't we be friends" and "The Last Dance", (again liner note writers please take note: Cahn & Van Heusen's song is called "The Last Dance" not "Last Dance").  But with a total running time of just over 39 minutes this CD is not great value.  If you have not encountered John Pizzarelli before, I would beg you not to start with this album.  Instead try "The Rare Delight of You" recorded with George Shearing.
0	Every time I attempted to download, the song didn't come through and I lost my money.  I wouldn't recommend trying it unless you have plenty of time to keep trying, or the money to lose.
0	I bought this song to add to a road trip playlist. I personally hate country music, but my buddy is a huge fan so I added it for him
0	It takes a lot for me to rate something at 1 star.  In this case I wish there was a minus-star system.  This song lacks any semblance of creativity nor displays any discernable musical ability.  All this equates to an entirely nauseating experience.
0	Whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual. Not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying, she actually sounds like she's trying. Id hate to hear what she sounds like on an off day.  I think this music was meant for prisoners of war that are meant to go through psychological torture. Please, do yourself a favor DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM OR ANYTHING ELSE BY THIS ARTIST. I guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do. I am forced to give this only one star and that in my opinion is VERY generous as I don't even think it is worthy of review. I only do this to warn my fellow music lovers.
0	Uninspiring.  Bought it for the Los Lonely Boys version of "Born on the Bayou" but even that is lackluster.
0	Song cuts off about 3/4 of the way through
0	Yuck.  Supposed to be a pop album, I get that.  But this is awful pop.  Sorry, Grace.  The only song worth a listen is Empty Heart.  It may only sound good because the rest of the album is so poor.
0	Enjoyed only one song, Toes
0	not the version it was supposed to be.
0	Sorry to bum people out but the vocals just ruin this, if you could call them vocals. It sounds like some one mumbling some spoken words under water or outside of the house when I listen to this on my great home stereo.  It would have been a better release if they just left the vocals or mumbling off.  This sounds like other darkwave/ambient works, Lycia is the closest comparison except Lycia's music is well made.  Sorry for the low rating but I doubt this will get much play again and I have a wide variety of tastes, I rarely exclude anything.
0	Only plays through media player hooked to the internet which tells me this is an illegal copy
0	First of all, this album is mostly a bunch of out-takes that weren't worth releasing when they were recorded.  It has been in my library for decades now and while there are some major talents represented here, I would never choose anything from this album to showcase those talents.  Probably better for the opportunity to check out the groups you've never heard before.  By the way, Tony (T.S.) McPhee was a more-than-marginal Brit Bluesman whose band the Groundhogs backed John Lee Hooker on a tour and one album.  EDIT: Please check the two comments attached for further discussion, especially since people found this post vague.
0	DOUBLE PURCHASE DUE TO HER SONGS LISTED BY ALBUM INSTEAD OF SINGULLY!
0	If he were not the son of his dad... A third listening won't be necessary. Sorry folks, I've been listening to the latest recording by Kyle Eastwood twice with an open mind. The least I can say is : don't waste your time nor your money. This is smooth jazz for VIP on a yacht (cocktail parties, etc..). No thought down here. Though they worked hard to release this record, the music is not essential whatsoever. But they dared ! OMG ! The musicians are ok but this is not serious (or too serious, it depends on the perspective). Some melodies are good though.. But the record is not worth its 5 stars (hence my reaction to write this little review ooposite to the other one...). If you want to hear the inspiration of these cats, better turn to Lee Morgan and all the Blue Note recordings (my gentle side). Or maybe Roy Hargrove... Now if you're keen to listening to David Sanborn, Kenny G (my evil side), that might be a good deal for you. After all, it depends on your tastes, which I won't question... I reckon, some people might like it. I don't, really... The music here is too light, too... The british musicians Kyle selected for this french session (recorded at La Buissonne) are unknown to me (on tenor sax, trumpet, piano and drums)... But honestly, if you want to listen to great bass players, why not turn to Richard Davis, Michael Formanek, Franois Moutin (in the last Rudresh Mahanthappa recording)... Of course, this is different... Here it's just for fun in Summer (you know, when the kids are running to and fro and you can't stop them from yelling... this music will calm them down). Or a lovely atmosphere when your guests are swimming in your pool, while you're getting the drinks ready. Well, skip it if you can. Sorry Kyle. I wish I could love it, but I can't. I'm happy you enjoyed recording this one though.
0	This song did not download to my amazon mp3 file where is my song and how can I listen to it on my iPhone thank you
0	This is not the version that you are looking for.  Have not found the version sung on Ondine yet.  dang it!
0	This song sounds like alot of other club songs that we have heard before and Jennifer Lopez's vocals are very weak. It's obvious that so many special effects have been added to pump up her vocals that the overall sound is overproduced. The lyrics and rap solo are repetitive and dumb and overall the effect is not good at all. JLO should just stick to being a judge on American Idol and leave the real singing to the many more talented signers that are out there: Mariah Carey, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Jennifer Hudson, Mary J. Blige - just to name a few.
0	Amazon... please stop placing this song over and over when I'm hold.  Hearing the same song is frustratingly annoying, especially when I have issues with my Amazon orders.  It makes it further worse when listening to it on the phone at 16kb with heavy static.
0	It did not download correctlyand now I'm not going to try it again,It was free so no loss no gain
0	This is not the version with Wanya Morris as the description indicates.  This needs to be removed or relabeled, false advertising.
0	One of my favorite hymns.  I use it with my devotions often.
0	I am really disappointed with this CD.  I just could not come to grips with the latin flavor.  Don't get me wrong I enjoy latin jazz/music but not from Bob.  This is a long way from his Standing Tall CD and any other.  I listened to this online and I am so glad that I did not buy it.  Maybe next time Bob.
0	Favourite band, awesome tracks, water-logged sleeve. I received this as gift, which I much appreciated, but due to a lack of a $0.001 plastic cover, it looks like it was dragged onto the beach at Normandy. It took forever to arrive, which would not be an issue, but since I'm here writing a review....  NO Forever!
0	Not a great song, unfortunately.
0	awful music
0	Hearing the song is infuriating every time I have to call Amazon customer service
0	Love new music and New Boyz song is hot Tiec Tocc and the Pac Rock Check them out and new boyz keep jerkin
0	Not my type of music
0	This was awful. I had to pay a shipping fee to pick it up from the post office due to insufficient funds when it was mailed to me even though I already paid amazon the required shipping nd handling fee. On top of that I thought this was the audio of the book by john steinbeck. Instead it was some type of  awful band. The cd came in a cracked case with a note written by a child who was so happy that I took this cd off her hand and it was sent with some profanity within her letter as well. I would encourage everyone not to order anything from this seller.
0	I can't tell if this is an album of 10 different, or unique songs OR ONE LONG TRACK, and a crappy one at that..wasted $$ more crap from Pharrell Williams, who seems to think that Happy was a success so its groove and time must be repeated endlessly...
0	I hope nobody continues to buy this, because Lana will not get a penny from it, because it's not an official release. When you buy this, you're basically giving your money to some random people who decided to take almost every song she's ever done and throw them on 2 discs in no particular order, and then make custom artwork for it. and then title it Greatest Hits(should it REALLY be called that, this release is mostly random album tracks).  Just buy her albums. She will probably get an actual singles compilation in a few years.
0	Not the original.
0	Sound quality was okay. The arrangement was different than the original as performed by Aaron Jeffrey. Having learned the original version I was unable to use this performance track as some of the notes and rhythms are enough different to require a complete do over on learning the song. A do over I did not have time for. Perhaps if I had not already learned another arrangement it would have been different.
0	My band decided to start covering this ridiculous pseudo disco excuse for a song so I bought the long version. Big mistake, I should have bought the radio edit and prevented myself from having to sing the whole thing.
0	Love Chante but the album is awful! I only could get into 2 songs. I thought this album was personal? The music, and lyrics don't agree. I expected heartfelt ballads, and raw emotion. Needless to say boy was I WRONG! C'mon Chante. I know you can deliver better music than this.
0	I was really excited for this album.  After the self titled album I thought they'd found their way, but I was wrong. this sounds like a more piano driven version of something Geoff Tate would do except his vocals would be awful.  It has all the trademarks of his work over the past decade and a half; a bunch of ballads, slow uninteresting and forgettable music, no hooks, no particular tone nor emotional connection to the listener, no consideration as to what the fans would want to hear, bad lyrics.  I may be forgetting something but you get the idea.  Ok so what's wrong with this album?  Well for starters there's NOTHING memorable about this album.  It's seriously painful to try to listen to front to back when there's absolutely nothing catching my attention.  There are a bleep ton of ballads.  The album has to be a minimum of half ballads if not more.  Now look Dream Theater has some amazing ballads in their catalog, usually an exception rather than the rule especially once Kevin More left but still they've had some amazing ones, but none of these are on the same level as any of those classic songs and frankly they haven't written a great ballad in a long time, a couple decent ones over the past decade but none have been great.  Then there's the whole rock opera thing.  I guess that's a genre some people like but I absolutely hate it, though in fairness this is my first and it's exactly what I think of when I hear the term.  Another reviewer already stated some of this music sounds like Disney music and it so does especially the overly bubbly happy chorus to one of the few semi better constructed songs on disc 1, towards the end but I forget its name.  What happened to the song structures?  Dream Theater use to be a band that would give you an album of 7 to 9 songs clocking in at about 75 minutes.  I'll admit some of those songs could use some trimming especially on Train of Thought, but that's the style most fans have gotten use to, and there'd be something incredible on every album.  Not here.  We get a bunch of 3 and 4 minute, at most, songs with several 1 and 2 minute tracks thrown in there, and they don't even construct them properly.  Take a 3 1/2 minute song they'll have a 1 1/2 minute intro and leave about 2 minutes to dedicate to the actual song, if it ever gets going.  This album is also a heavily Jordan featured album.  I've said it before he's the worst thing to ever happen to Dream Theater.  I hate the man as a musician with everything that I am.  I'm tired of his circus music, boring piano pieces and nonsensical and unnecessary contributions to the band.  He was fine on Scenes from a Memory and hit and miss on 6 Degrees but he's been awful ever since.  I really hope these guys don't become the new 1999-2012 Queensryche cause while I enjoyed making fun of them it really came from a place of sadness, witnessing a once great band become a waste of anything involved in the making, producing and listening to  of any of their albums. I don't want that to become these guys.  Already this is the worst album of 2016 for me.  I don't care what else is released.  Already this year we've had albums by Megadeth-a good album, and Primal Fear-so so but better than this.  This thing is seriously so bad I listened to Kiss after, mother you know what KISS!!  That's how terible this is that anything Kiss has ever done, even their most silly cheesy uninteresting or over the top song is still better than this trash.  I would rather listen to In Flames's Siren Charms.  Yes it's an awful attempt at mainstream radio rock from a band that shouldn't attempt it but it had 2 good songs and wasn't 2 discs and over 30 tracks.  heck the bonus tracks were even ok.  Heck I'd rather listen to Q2k, Mindcrime 2, and American Soldier many times over before hearing this again.  Heck even Dedicated to chaos had 1 ok song.  There's absolutely nothing on here that's any good.  3 songs; A Better Life, A Life Left Behind and Moment Of Betrayal are ok as in if they were the weakest songs on an album of actual good songs they'd be worth listening enough that you wouldn't need to skip them.  Oh and this is really a John Petrucci solo album not a Dream Theater album, much like Q2k-Dedicated to chaos are Geoff Tate solo albums.  this isn't good and no one should ever have this in their collection for nay reason EVER.  But listen to it before you buy it. If you like it then by all means get it but be sure to listen to the whole thing first.  Oh and Def Leppard's self titled album is also better which is just sad.  If you want a good prog metal album pick up anything by Symphony X especially their 2 most recent albums.  Now that's a band that can show off their talent and write good songs.  In closing this album makes me angry.  It shouldn't I suppose but it does.  This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard a band I like put out and I won't support this garbage.
0	Super annoying cricket chirps non stop....did not enjoy this at all... same loop over and over again. I would not encourage people to buy this.
0	Taylor Swift's attitude has really made me stop buying her music. Sorry, not sorry.
0	I did not realize this was different than the one I hear on the radio - don't know why thay bothered when they had a great song and this version took the power out of the regular version just so he could cuss. It will be a while before I would get another of their songs - it would really have to be something special. I will erase it from my library because the music was ruined, not by the words but the terrible music quality.
0	Poor signing, poor bass playing, poor drum, poor keyboard playing and poor guitar solos, many of my friends are better that this, no emotion, no performance and the sounds is just like a garage band on a 4 tracks. Not recommanded as far as I am concerned.
0	NEVER ordered this! WOW!
0	This CD should be titled Tropical Music with other percussion.  The music is good, but not what I expected by the title.  Guitar is what you get mostly (80-85%) and when the steel drums finally come it is overshadowed by guitar.  As far as Caribbean I would say not so much, more Hawaiian.  As a tropical CD you will not be disappointed, but if you are looking for steel drums it isn't here, not one song is exclusively steel drums.
0	Joe has the comedic value of a child with stage 4 cancer. He epitomizes the word HACK. I've seen open miker's that look like old Dice Clay compared to this clown. Don't waste your money or time on anything Joe Derosa is involved in unless you want to be in a bad mood for the rest of your life.  Hail Cumia!
0	Only a quarter of the music on this album is from Fallout. The rest is from the $5 dollar bin at Walmart. I suggest you buy the songs separately or not at all. This is totally unofficial.
0	Cd did not even work got ripped off everybody know do not buy cds on here
0	I bought Dylan's Christmas in the Heart CD today.  I haven't bought a CD in 2 or 3 years.  The concept of Dylan singing Christmas carols seemed unusual, so I thought I would give it a listen.  Is it possible to create one of the best albums of all time (Blood on the Tracks) & one of the worst?  Not only is this Christmas CD/album unusual, it could be one of the worst albums of all time.  You can't play it around little kids, I think they would be scared & start crying.  My ears hurt listening to it.  It may even cause bleeding in the aural canal.  It is not just disappointing, but it is historically bad.  If you didn't know it was Dylan singing, you might think is was William Huang of American Idol infamy or a drunk uncle who smoked too much & sang into a tape recorder.  This is from a context of me liking much, but not all, of Dylan's stuff. I think Love & Theft from about 5 years ago is great.  Dylan's CITH CD's badness is of historical magnitude.  I listen to it because it is so unbelievably bad, perhaps like slowing down on a highway to get a better look at a fatal car crash.  All proceeds go to charity, so at least something good is coming out of this project.  Merry Christmas to all & best wishes for 2010.
0	just not what i want to hear at any time of the year. I guess you get what you pay for.
0	There is something seriously wrong with this recording.  I downloaded one song and it has a lot of interference or static -- as if the instruments were too close to the microphone -- or something even more drastic.  You can hear how bad the clip is on The Rose (& probably other cuts -- I was too pained to listen longer).
0	that's terrible I'm sorry should be the title of this double CD from Joe Derosa, but then if you've ever listened to his comedy or him speak long-form on radio or podcasts, it's him in a nutshell... just kind of meandering and not really going anywhere, while sounding like a whiny ex girlfriend who just wants to be liked but can't help but being annoying and pushing people away and burning all her bridges.  I get the sense Joe cared more about what his black friends would think than of actually putting out some honest comedy that spoke to the audience. I rather listen to my Arminian neighbor across the hall try to tell me knock-knock jokes in his native language than attempt to hear any of this Derosa comedy. This CD is likely some of the worst material ever recorded onto a bit of plastic and I get the impression that I've heard it before - from all the not funny coworkers I've ever worked with who are trying to get laughs but just obnoxious and everyone hates.
0	Reznor records himself sitting on his keyboard....shuffles his buttocks around a bit....and then sells it.....
0	Worth the price I guess
0	The stories are read too fast with no ups and downs in the tone.  Hard for our 4 year old to understand.
0	I've gotten the chance to listen to only a small portion of the CD and that was in my car.  I had to turn the volume to maximum in order to be able to hear the quieter portions of the Swedish Rhapsody No. 1.  I'm not talking about real pianissimo here (listen to the beginning of Rachmaninov's "Isle of the Dead" for some of that), just that anything shy of double forte could not be heard at normal volume settings.  As a result, I am in no position to judge the performance or arrangement.
0	As a die-hard Rick Springfield fan from the 80's I was eager to get this album. The songs are well done and the music is very nice, but Rick's voice sounds like he's smoked WAY too much for way too long. A little rapsy is one thing, but this album sounds like he was choking the whole time. I'm sorry I bought it and am thinking of reselling it. I couldn't even listen to the whole CD without being annoyed at the crackle of his voice. It almost doesn't even sound like him. Sorry, Rick.
0	I first saw Josh Groban when he performed 'Time to say goodbye' with Sarah Brightman on her 2000 La Luna concert tour and was so excited when he came out with an album of his own.  I have seen him twice in concert and own all of his albums, but this one is total crap. Dog crap, on the bottom of my shoe crap. I am so beyond disappointed with this and I want my money back.
0	I don't write reviews for albums very often because everyone has a different taste in music so to each his/her own.  I signed up for the pre-purchase of this album and was so excited this morning when it streamed down to my device.  I couldn't wait to drive to work and hear some new Amy Lee (I was very aware of the fact that this is not an Evanescence CD).  What I am left with is a solid " WHA???" I'm at a loss.  This album is so bad that I am thinking of using it to punish my 9 year old son when he gets in trouble by putting headphones on him and making him listen to the whole thing.  When you have someone as talented as Amy Lee do something as horrible as this it really makes me shake my head in disbelief.  Why oh why would she do this to her career. (shaking head and walking away)
0	One need listen to nothing else other than 'Rockin The Man In The Boat' to fully realize what an absolute perverted creep Mike Love is....purchase for entertainment value only.  It is pure rubbish.
0	I like the song fine, but I tried two times to get the recording to download properly. It skips all the way through. Sorry, me no likey.
0	There is only one good song on this album. We were extremely disappointed. After the 1st song, the remainder of the songs are extremely twangy.
0	As long time fans, we received Illuminations for Christmas and were excited to listen to it.  After reading some of the reviews here, we can tell that we are not alone in being less than pleased.  The Josh Groban voice is still fantistic;  however, the unusual arrangements and the frequent use of falsetto did not capitalize on his fantistic voice.
0	Made a mistake on this version (jazz)...
0	We have followed the Blink for years.  We have all previous CD's and like them all. We feel, after listening to it many times, that it is far below their other offerings. We do not know what they were thinking. California?  We live in PA and could care less about LA or San Diego.  The guys need to explain this sad mess to their dedicated fans. Many of the "songs" sound as if they took a large sampling of their previous works, threw them in a blender and poured it out as this cd. Sad, very sad.  Buyers, Beware!
0	I thought this was what was played on the radio years ago. I soon found out it was a strange version with talking so I deleted it from my files and bought the original version.
0	Obviously a bootleg. Terrible sound quality, as if from nth-generation tapes (one cut is an LP dub, complete with surface noise). Stick to legit compilations, e. g. Look Thru the Eyes of Roy Wood: Best of the Jet Years & Beyond.
0	I loved the first Flyleaf album.  It was a balanced mixture of rock with angst, questioning, and religious overtones.  The Christian influence was there but subtle, serving as a background for the music to unfold.  I respect people's faith and the influence it has on their work.  But I've seen the interviews where Lacey is touting they're a rock band, not a Christian rock band.  So not true.  This is rock music with in-your-face Jesus lyrics.  "Beautiful Bride, Body of Christ" ends with the Hallelujah chorus.  You can't get more openly Christian rock band than a lead track like that.  I'm Christian.  I understand faith.  I just appreciate honesty.  This is a Christian rock band, no longer just with hints of influence, but straight up revival music.  I would have liked to have known before I bought the album.  Shame on me for believing the interviews.
0	Don't trust those third party retailers bro, they don't want you to have lunch.  To make a long muthafuckin story short i bought this from another retailer for a significantly lower price and ended receiving the wrong edition.  Stay Woke
0	AS FAR AS I KNOW, I DID NOT ORDER THIS BOOK.  I'M WONDERING WHY IT HAS SHOWN UP ON  MY ACCOUNT.  I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HARRY NILSSON IS.  CAN I JUST NOT RATE THIS ITEM AT ALL?
0	Passenger's "Let Her Go" has some deep and meaningful lyrics, but I just couldn't get past the singer's voice.  I'm all for quirky vocalists that don't fit the tradional mold, but I just couldn't get into the guy's voice.
0	Listening to this song is just unpleasant. I have tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but I simply cannot understand why people seem to like it so much. The music is boring and almost every line of the song starts with "I want a girl" then lists some shallow or unreasonable standard. I'm not a feminist, or even a girl, but I felt like jerk just hearing it. Maybe this is because I don't know anything about "Chuck" but that would just mean nostalgia which doesn't excuse anything. Sorry, I'm not here to upset anyone but it is only my opinion.
0	I've read Jonah Hex for decades.  This movie is Jonah Hex in name only.  I agree 100% with the reviewer said the closest you can come to Jonah Hex would be to watch the "Outlaw Josey Wells" with Clint Eastwood.  Clint would have been perfect to play Jonah if it was made around the same time as Josey.  I recently saw "Batman: Under the Red Hood" which had a Jonah Hex animated short on the DVD and it was so much better than the movie.
0	Unfortunately we have not been as impressed with this CD as much as Lunatics. That is our favorite one.
0	What happened to these guys? I am a fan of the Crows, but after such a long time away I would have expected more. I did not write this review right away; I waited a while and went back over and over to listen to the album. I still cannot get into it and I really don't think there is anything memorable here.
0	When I heard DT was going to put together a 2 disc rock opera about a dystopian future I thought two things: 1) DT is attempting to realize some sort of 2112 fantasy and 2) Recording 2 full discs of good, let alone great material, is incredibly difficult and there are going to be some dead spots across the album. Not only are there dead spots but most of the 2 disc affair is barren of any memorable melodies, lyrics, or solo's. The album is simply dull. I feel like I am hearing the same song start over and over again as I work my way through 2+ hours of material. So while I was not expecting a masterpiece, I didn't think the album would be this poor and tedious.  However, for those who enjoy a Jordan Rudess dominated album, this is the album for you. There is plenty of ragtime, circus music and repetitive piano intro's throughout to delight your ears. This is easily Myung's most uninspired performance. JM could have been replaced by a generic studio musician to achieve this level of bass playing which is buried behind a wall of dull, overwrought keyboard and guitar parts. Sadly this album rivals Systematic Chaos for worst DT album ever recorded, albeit for very different reasons. At least SC was a cohesive, succinct songwriting effort whereas The Astonishing is anything but.  I'll write this off as an aberration, assume they got this out of their system, and look forward to the next album. This will be the first DT tour I miss since the mid-90's.
0	Seriously this sounds like bad karaoke of all the songs on the set.  If you've heard any of the originals, it'll make you wince because it sounds quite like a robbery, not just covers of the originals.  Most of the songs sound like really bad versions by a generic cover band, yet trying to sing and play in the same style and effect (but fails), with no added interpretations or putting a different spin on them. Some Examples: "The River", originally by&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Joni-Mitchell/dp/B000002KBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Joni Mitchell</a>, but sung and played like the version by the band&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Travis/dp/B0000VV41S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Travis</a>, makes you wanna skip this version and hear that version.  I hadn't even heard the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elvis/dp/B000002W8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elvis</a>&nbsp;song, "Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)" but it's just such a blatant ripoff, that you can hear in your mind Elvis (or a Vegas impersonator) singing it instead.  I'm sure if anybody was going to cover that song, it would be better by&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Reverend-Horton-Heat/dp/B000ARWIJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Reverend Horton Heat</a>, or even&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dread-Zeppelin/dp/B000003RDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dread Zeppelin</a>, if they ever did it.  "Happy Xmas (War is Over)" adds nothing to the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/John-Lennon/dp/B005BCNSF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">John Lennon</a>&nbsp;original, better as an example for an interpretation is the version by&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Alarm/dp/B000001J6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Alarm</a>.  Oh yeah, and the cover of "2000 Miles", Originally by&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Pretenders/dp/B000001J70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Pretenders</a>, is just an insult, especially for anyone who has ever seen them live.  Truly, I tried to like at least one song on this album, but honestly, it's really not even *that* good, so skip it unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of Train, and must have it, and/or just because you live on the train tracks.  :)
0	The music is good, his voice is still that lovable, scratchy drawl, but there's something different...the lyrics are awful. This is his second album from his born-again christian stage. Leave this one alone, skip it, don't even bother with it, unless you can completley ignore the lyrics and focus soley on the music and his voice. "What God has given us, no man can take away" - Precious Angel. Arghh!  Go to Blood on the Tracks, or Blonde on Blonde. Some older stuff. Leave this alone.
0	Being Flemish myself I know how little my own language has changed the people singing here don't the first thing about it, and think they are singing German, by the way not the same thing. If you are looking for real Flemish medieval songs, this would not be it, the songs are OK not to great as far as medieval music goes, yet it is entertaining. I would say learn Flemish if you are going to sing it please so I can actually understand you when you sing. I othere then that if you don't care about being able to understand then I guess you will like it
0	Absolutely Terrible; Mass Produced, R & B Type High Pitched Singing, this dude is so annoying. The theory is he is still relevant because his fan base thinks there special by listening to this garbage. Rapping Cupcake, He is a lil Debbie of the Rap Game!!
0	Let me start by saying I really like this band and their music. HOWEVER, I was unbelievably disappointed with this CD. Coming from an audio engineering background(albeit 25 years ago) I was appalled with the audio quality of this recording. I was first introduced to the band by watching festival performances and a headliner concert on Palladia. I asked for the CD for Christmas since I liked just about everything I had heard from them up to this point. I  put the CD in my car and pushed play expecting to be rocking out in no time. I really thought someone had borrowed my car and blown my speakers. Even with the bass turned waaay down, it is distorted almost to the point of unlistenability if that is a word (if not, it should be). I wish I had looked at these reviews before asking for it. I will stick to listening to them on live performances where the audio isn't "tricked out" in such a horrible way. I saw in a former review that this was intentional by the producer. I hope these reviews have been seen by him and I hope he realizes the mistake.
0	Didn't really care for it. Sorry.
0	Not what I was expecting.
0	I expected Susan Boyle to belt it out. I could barely hear her . What is all the fuss about?
0	I don't know what this crap is - but it's not the song I know and love.  Same lyrics, same band - but not the same song.  See other review - it's right!  PLEASE GET THE GOOD VERSION!  The MP3 is available on the Napoleon Dynamite soundtrack - so we know it's out there.  What a waste of $$$ this one is!
0	This album cover gave the appearance that it was by Alabama, the country singers.  It is definitly NOT!  I do Not care for this album at all !!!  It is loud and noisy!
0	What is this???? I don't remember purchasing this
0	decent i suppose
0	This is the countyrish verision, not what plays on the radio.  Ok but not great if you don't like twang.
0	There has honestly been no question about the lackluster reaction Mariah Carey has drove in with Memoris Of An Imperfect Angel. The songs here on the album have not really been the strongest of her career, and she hasn't had that chart-strength she had shown from her past, and that has sadly shown with other divas like Beyonce', Rihanna, and the dynamic return of Whitney Houston dominating the music scene. Mariah hasn't shown that well with her last single, her cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, which didn't even crack the Top 40. Now, her latest single, H.A.T.E.U., the third single from her album is very weak, and tries to bring in a more simplistic feeling to her voice. Unfortunately, I wasn't appealed into the song, and it wasn't like the ballads she used to score with like Dreamlover and Through The Rain. It really was one of the weaker tracks from the album. I think Mariah should really try harder to deliver a more wide-appealing album when she does get around to it, because she really took a huge tumble on Memoirs. Hopefully, she will and hard core fans will be awaiting something better than this.  Song: D+
0	so so
0	The rock and roll is gone from this offering. They have moved to a pop sound. I am not a fan of this new style. I much prefer the old 3DD with a hard edge to the rock songs. You will not find that on this album. I am disappointed.
0	Record was warped.
0	Weren't as good as I remembered after all.  I was sad I bought the album.  Waste of money
0	Ok.
0	Just listening to the samples I can tell this music is crap. This band is kind of like Daft Punk if they overused auto-tune and had no talent. This album is track after track of repetitive and shrill noise and represents everything that sucks about electronic music. I wouldn't pick up this album is amazon paid me 3.99.
0	This is not the original version of Midnight at the Oasis! I listened to Midnight at the Oasis back in the 70s. This version is Maria but she sounds about 20 years older.
0	My story first goes back to 2001 where I first heard 'To Where You  Are' on the radio. Needless to say, I wasn't a fan straight away, but when 'You Are Loved' came out, I became a diehard  fan, even calling myself a Grobanite.  If  your going to buy a Josh Groban album, I suggest you get 'Closer' it is one of my favorites.  This album however is not. From the subpar performances that Josh has done, to the lackluster album, where notes are forced, and painfull to listen to,  this album lacks in so many ways it isn't even funny. Even his 'Awake' was much better then this.  The album lacks in songwriting, for me, if I don't relate to the lyrics of a song, it doesn't click for me and I don't like it.  None of the lyrics make sence on this album. With 'February Song' that was a hit. None of this songs are hit miterial.  Second of all things cannot be done in just one take. It might sound impressive to most, but not here. There is no emotion, no passion nor feeling when he is  singing at all.  A word of advice Josh, go back to your classical rutes, no more experimenting, it's over. Go back to making music with David Foster, and leave the songwriting up to the experts.  I unfortunately will not be seeing Josh on tour with this album like I have done in the past. I'm hoping that  this is not the future  of many Josh albums to come, because  if it is, I will be getting off the  Josh Groban train.
0	Pretty cheesey song. The Marines deserve better! It sounds like something that was written while on the toilet! Still like Toby!
0	His singing on this album really isn't like his singing on TV. I really wanted to like this album but I like a little blues/country in my rock-n-roll and this just didn't appeal to me. I really like his voice so I hope future releases are more to my taste.
0	This misguided young lady recently offered Lillo Brancato, who was recently released from prison a role in an upcoming video . Lillo who was famous for his role in A Bronx Tale is now infamous for his part in committing a burglary with his friend that resulted in his friend shooting and killing off duty NYPD Police Officer Daniel Enchautegui.  Detective Daniel Enchautegui was shot and killed when he interrupted a burglary in progress while off-duty.  Detective Enchautegui had just returned home after finishing a late shift when he heard breaking glass in the house next door to his. He called 911 to report a possible burglary in progress. He then grabbed his off-duty 9mm weapon, put his police shield around his neck so he would not be mistaken for a suspect by responding officers and went outside to investigate.  As Detective Enchautegui waited for back-up units, two suspects emerged from the rear of the location. Detective Enchautegui drew his weapon and identified himself as a police officer by yelling "Police, Don't Move" in both English and Spanish. One of the men turned on Detective Enchautegui with a .357 caliber handgun in hand and opened fire, striking Detective Enchautegui once in the chest, piercing his heart. Despite being mortally wounded, Detective Enchautegui was able to return fire, firing all eight rounds from his weapon, striking one suspect twice and the other suspect six times.  Officers responding to the scene apprehended both suspects as they were attempting to flee and recovered the weapon used to kill Detective Enchautegui.  Detective Enchautegui was taken to Jacobi Medical Center where he died from his wound.  In November 2008 one suspect was convicted of Aggravated Murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The second suspect(Brancato) was acquitted of Murder charges, and found guilty of Attempted Burglary  Detective Enchautegui was posthumously promoted from Police Officer to Detective on December 14, 2005 by the Police Commissioner. On June 15, 2006, he was posthumously awarded the New York City Police Department's Medal of Honor.  Detective Enchautegui had served with the New York City Police Department for three years, and was assigned to the 40th Precinct in the Bronx.
0	PRODUCTION: 4/8 LYRICS: 4/8 CONTENT: 4/8 ENJOYMENT: 4/8  O.N.I.F.C. is a boring album with a repetitive sound and irrelevant content, Wiz Khalifa does nothing to heighten the enjoyment as his flow and delivery is lazy and uninteresting.  The production consists of a laid back and chill vibe with a slow bpm.  The sound is very cohesive and it transitions well but the tracks come off repetitive and not attention grabbing; only the Neptune's track catches the ear.  Wiz Khalifa delivers a decent but rather lazy performance, literally talking about that same ol' jazz: marijuana, money, lavish living.  There is a little bit of meaning but that is essentially muffled by the excessive irrelevance.  Boring and uninteresting.
0	This song is very aggressive and not easy on my ears.  I absolutely adore Jennifer Lopez, but when I was buying this song, I did not get to hear preview - my bad.  There is another super-wonderful song on this album "Di me porque lloras... De felicidad" - I wish I purchased that one, instead.  That other song is brilliant, sensual and touching.  I love Jennifer Lopez.  I am very much like her, just not Puerto Rican :)
0	Are You kidding me?  Susan Boyle, is a nice lady I'm sure.  But an artist, a singer, a star....no!  Here notes are wobbly, and pitchy at best, her phrasing is nothing interesting or smart.  And I feel nothing more listening to her than I would at a decent karaoke performance. Don't be sucked into the hype and help Simon Cowell make any more money...be smart and listen with your ears to great singers.  Linda Eder, Barbra, Ella, Eden Espinosa, Kiri Takanawa...those are ARTISTS!
0	I'd like to first say that I'm giving this record just a little bit over two stars because there are some tracks that are worth listening to but for the most part, it's EDM garbage, recycled beats, clichd lyrics. I think Katy Perry is a very talented performer, her last record had some very good songs (Firework, Teenage Dream, Circle the Drain, Hummingbird Heartbeat), and this record really lacks the consistency of her previous record. This record attempts to jump around genres and it just doesn't work because their is no coherence, it's just one song after the next, not an album. I think Perry's best songs on this record are the ones that are the most cerebral and personal. Perry herself stated that she was sick of mainstream pop music and that she would abandon it following this album and tour, I can see why with the catastrophe this record is and the fact that all pop music has become very derivative and boring. Here's a track by track review:  1. "Roar" 7/10 - A fairly good single, very radio friendly, catchy, the lyrics are uplifting and chorus is energetic. Unfortunately, the lyrics while very uplifting and positive are very clichd and derivative. The ending of the chorus if very annoying with the tremolo like 'oh oh oh's'. It's a good lead off single but it's misleading because the rest of the record bares little resemblance to this song. This song contains some real instrumentation while the remainder of the album is mostly electronic.  2. "Legendary Lovers" 7/10 - The electronic beats are very boring, the chorus is catchy, the lyrics are good but the vocals lack until the chorus rips around. This is another track that could be improved to be a breakout hit. I feel that this is one of the stronger tracks even though it receives the same score as 'Roar'.  3. "Birthday" 5/10 - I heard the funky groove and soulful vocals and I thought this would be a hit. It turns out the lyrics are very bad, nothing but stereotypical 'birthday' lyrics. The chorus is catchy but I just can't take it seriously. The instrumentation is a sigh of relief but I think the lyrics and vocals ruin this song.  4. "Walking on Air" 7/10 - This is very EDM influenced, the beat is catchy, the lyrics are clichd but they work, the vocals are strong enough to carry the song. The chorus is catchy but the lyrics are bland and lack originality. I enjoy the song only because the production is excellent, the vocals are good, and the beat is catchy.  5. "Unconditionally" 9/10 - The best track on the record, it's a very emotional the lyrics are very personal, the beat is a little boring but once the chorus comes around it becomes a powerhouse. The lyrics are a little forced but I think the vocal force makes it work. It's the best song on the record but still it could use a little work.  6. "Dark Horse" 2/10 - Horrible song after a great song, the beat is so cheap, the production is poor. The little sound effects are very annoying, Perry's vocals just do not work with this style of hip-hop music. It's just a boring song.  7. "This is How We Do" 4/10 - Not a good song, the lyrics are poor at best, it's very clichd and derivative. The chorus features very monotonous vocals and just becomes very irritating. This song while has a catchy beat lacks emotion and intelligence.  8. "International Smile" 6/10 - Reminds me a bit of Hummingbird Heartbeat, the beat is very similar, the little guitar riff is similar, it's a catchy tune with a powerhouse chorus. The vocals are very good on this track but personally, when a song sounds so close to another song but fails to recapture the originals magic, I tend to not enjoy it and go back to the original.  9. "Ghost" 5/10 - Another mid tempo track, the lyrics are personal again but they lack the power from Unconditionally. The beat is annoying in the verses, the chorus is catchy but fails to impress compared to some of the other choruses on the record.  10. "Love Me" 6/10 - The beat is quick, the lyrics are cerebral which is a plus, the start of the song is great, I really enjoy it, the lyrics aren't as clich as some of the other songs on the record but the chorus is just bad. It resembles too closely the verse, the vocals are too similar and really add no power. Listen for the verses, it's not something you do too much in pop music nowadays.  11. "This Moment" 6/10 - Sounds like something Daft Punk would do, the lyrics aren't good but they're not bad. The beat is catchy, the verse builds up well to a fairly powerful chorus. It's one of those songs that if you're into anything that has a good beat, then you will like it. If your searching for something more original then this track might not do it for you.  12. "Double Rainbow" 4/10 - Boring song, the lyrics are not too bad but are just so full of clichs. The chorus isn't that great, the verses are boring, it's just not a good song.  13. "By the Grace of God" 9/10 - Another great track, starts with a soft piano, the lyrics are cerebral and personal, the vocals are emotional and heartfelt, powerful song. The perfect amount of vocal effects are added, the production is beautiful, it's a great song. The chorus shouldn't be electronic thought, it should be an acoustic guitar and maintain that personal identity. That's the only downfall of the song. Great lyrics in the chorus, the electronics are not necessary.  This record is a mixed bag, there is a lot of filler, about three really good songs but overall this album lacks the coherence of Teenage Dream and doesn't live up to some of the better pop releases. I will admit that I listen to mostly metal music but I do enjoy every genre of music for what it is. I talk a lot about derivative beats and clichs because those are the quirks that annoy me the most and I feel that this record uses so much that has already been done. If you enjoy it, that's fine, good for you. I would not recommend this anybody but hardcore Katy Perry fans because I think it'll keep them happy enough until she puts out some really good music. Enjoy, or don't, whatever floats your boat.
0	I'll never buy from Northstar or Daewoo again.  I had this player unpacked for a while before starting it up, so unfortunately I can't return it.  It only works for about 30 minutes before it stops, starts reloading, sound dies, or does something else bizarre. It doesn't respond to the remote, and I have to power down to try and finish the DVD I'm watching.
0	I have NO idea why this is in my orders for the simple reason I never ordered it!
0	This is not going to keep you in the business.  Compared to your first CD, this one is...less than buyable, but I HAD to buy it because I have to help keep you in the game.  You have talent and the ablity to make very good music.  The only song I can listen to on this CD more than once is Free. I still have your last CD in my Jeep.  I hope you have another chance.  Get back to lyrics that make you think and can relate to.  And please leave the stale sound behind you.  Get back to the cigarettes, mistakes, fears, love and heart of life.
0	Always loved it, until I listened to the words. Infidelity abounds!!
0	This download was rather loud and sounds a bit distorted. =/  If you can find a better version somewhere I recommend avoiding this one.
0	This isn't music. this is just bogus noise! This album along with all the others i've heard from this so called "artist" is trash rap. Nothing on this comes close to being labeled real hip hop. i don't recommend this junk to anyone unless your one of the other little young, dumb teens out there who are the only ones actually buying this garbage! NOT WORTH A DIME, or a PENNY for that matter! Don't even download this, if its FREE! I was given this cd and now i know why! NO one wants this and just life my friend was getting rid of trash when he gave it to me, i threw this out the window on the freeway.
0	I bought this album and it was a waste of money. I respect the fact that Max has a lot of pent-up anger; he has the soul to be a musician, but he lacks any musical prowess. He has only got four strings on his guitar, and those aren't even tuned correctly. As a result his music is repetitive and boring; if you've heard one song you've heard them all. If you want to revel in pain, I'd recommend Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral. If you want music to be angry to, I'd recommend Slayer - Reign In Blood. Max is nothing more than a big baby with a big amp.
0	CAVEAT EMPTOR!  This is one of the most mind-bogglingly stupid things I have ever had the misfortune to buy.  Readers Digest has taken four CD's worth of their excellent classical recordings and issued them with nature sounds overdubbed on top of the music!  Waterfalls, chirping birds, thunderstorms, etc.  Nowhere in the packaging is this disfigurement mentioned.  I wonder what the shades of Charles Gerhardt, Kenneth Wilkerson, Douglas Gamley, Massimo Freccia, and the other musicians who made the often superb original recordings think of this travesty.  This would be a zero-star review if Amazon permitted it.
0	i have been brian mcknight fan since his first album, i was waiting on this album for several months with high hopes, the only song i found decent was the uh oh feeling, but that was released before the album anyways, this album was very very disappointing to me, but this album should have been called his worse, i love brian so much and cant get over how horrible this is , my name is mrsmusic912 on youtube
0	Didn't really like the crowd noise during the song. Kind of took away from it. Love Elvis though. Thank you
0	OMGosh, I don't think tortured dogs would be more painful to listen to.  For free, I over paid.  My deaf Aunt in law is not as tone deaf as this song.  Seriously.
0	If I knew this was going to be in spanish I wouldn't  have bought it,I don't understand what he's saying
0	Two stars because of the record itself. LOVE Elle King - incredible voice and great songs. I want this on vinyl so badly. First two records I received are extremely poor quality. Both have plastic flashing around outer edge, center hole is barely large enough, and record is warped! Praying third time is the charm!
0	Well I listened to this "new release" hoping to get some insight into the live shows MJ was workiing on. In other words I was very disappointed to find a collection of "B-sides" and "demos". Yes the new song is a demo. For the hanger-ons this probably will sell but this didn't work for me, talk about exploitation, MJ is probably rolling in his grave on this release day.
0	The download I got after paying is a corrupt file. My mp3 player gives an error message half way in playing. I sent email to Amazon customer service. They replied that they allow download only once. So they cannot help me!  If you decide to buy, you better pray that nothing bad happens during the download, because you got only one chance. I don't remember exactly how big the file is. Must be more than 100MB. Here's Amazon reply in all its official glory:  "I'm sorry to hear that you encountered a problem with "Relaxing Seaside (Nature Sounds Only Version)" by Nature Sound Series.  Amazon MP3 files are only available for download at the time of purchase. We display information about the items you've purchased from the Amazon MP3 Music Downloads store in Your Media Library so you can keep track of what you've bought and discover similar items that may be available.

0	When I think of summer, I think of an upbeat, fun, blissful sound of music. This is not that.
0	At 1st thought the beat was good...but was then very, very shocked at what the song was really about.  Another song made in extremely poor taste.
0	Don't buy this album! I'm the host of a radio program, and downloaded "Precious and Few" for an episode. Thanks to great Amazon customer service, I was able to get refunded and downloaded a much better quality release, from the album "70s Top 40."
0	A Kardashian could put out a better album, and they probably are more musically inclined than this leech that latched onto Brian Wilson
0	Too much flute. I wanted more English horn. Reminded me of elevator music. I would return it if I could.
0	this was not the song i was wanting or pulled up , i feel like i was trick into buying it.
0	I thought I wasa fan of the B-52s from back in the day, but either my memory fails me or my taste has changed drastically
0	music is not same as on tv
0	I thought this was a reissue or remaster of the original, but it is a remix by a DJ.  It lists "Willie Bobo" in the artist column, so I thought it was the original.  This is the version you would hear while sitting in a hipster joint surrounded by people wearing horn rim glasses. This stuff is the new Muzak. Background noise for people who don't know or care about music. Download the original Willie Bobo or even the Santana version if you are a musician or a fan of music.  As far as remixes go, there is nothing creative going on. You can get get the same sound by downloading the original and hitting the "Back" arrow on your ipod every few beats to make it repeat a phrase.
0	This release was issued in the early days of cd production, and the sound quality is very poor: tinny, thin and faint. Unless you really 'need' any of these very commercial tracks (as a collection it's a very uneven listening experience) I'd suggest giving it a miss.
0	Unsuccessful purchase.
0	my download will not sync to my iphone. I have tried everything and every suggestion so far. Will never order from Amazon again. There are no suggestions on how to fix this. Nothing to do with the song, love the song, hate that this doesn't work on my iphone. I can hear it on the computer but I want it so I can hear it in my car. would ask for my money back, but doubt that I would get it.
0	This does not appear to be the original recording of the song.  It had a "muddy" sound, not the crisp electronic song that I remembered.  When I went back and looked at Amazon's Gary Numan page I found other versions of this song, including one from a Gary Numan album instead of the one in this "Essential '80s" compilation.  I downloaded the version from Gary Numan's album and was much happier with the sound.
0	Would have received more stars but I could not download it directly to my phone. I don't want multiple music apps on my device. One location for music period.
0	The illustrations were not included.  so very difficult to follow direction
0	I prefer the studio version....
0	I would recommend finding a different version to download.  I absolutely love this song, it has good sound quality, BUT they cut off the entire last word/note!  It drives me crazy and really ruins the track.
0	This is a longer cut of the song than is on the Greatest Hits album.  It finishes the song and then announces the next song and then just as they are getting ready to play, it stops.  Don't get this track alone.  Only purchase if you are buying the whole album.
0	If I could give zero stars I would.  Downloaded both "CD 1 and 2".  CD one is great, but the tracks on "CD 2" won't play!!
0	So So So disappointed. He should not have gone this way! My daughter laughed!
0	Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
0	First, let me state that I am a huge Jackie Evancho fan.  This album - Silver Screen - is a big disappointment for me.  Jackie's voice belongs with opera and/or robust Broadway type music.  She has a very special and beautiful voice that needs to be carefully matched with the right kind of music, and carefully fitted with arrangements that support rather than overpower her voice.  I found each and every song on this album to be...well...just wrong for her.  These tunes demand a soft and light voice; Jackie has a very major and what I call heavy voice.  She is beyond wonderful with the right songs, but I found her voice did not match the reflection needed for each of these light songs.  I also found her breathing to be heavy; not sure why.  Further, the orchestration  was too much and seemed distracting to me. I am very concerned that Ms. Evancho's managers are taking her off course.  Its time to reflect on the incredible gift she has; keep her focused on music that her voice is made for.  All in all....please focus Jackie on doing the music she is destined for; don't force it like happened with this album.  Jackie is not a pop singer; she has a unique and special soprano voice that should be allowed to develop along with carefully selected music that warrants her talents.
0	A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series by WR Records (Vol. 1 through 10).  Very little information transpired by the time the album was  announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the  impression this was a new album rather than a "best-of"  compilation.  If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not  necessarily need this album.
0	Great album, but until Amazon fixes the intermittent static in the tracks, don't click buy.  Unless you liked listening to scratched CDs, and miss that lovely hiss...
0	A mean-spirited rip off by the network to avoid paying and crediting the artist who created this arrangement. Support the real spirit of Glee by buying the original&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Baby Got Back (In the Style of Glee)</a>
0	This Album seemed rushed, Lacked substance and showed little growth as a artist in my opinion. To me it was very boring and a lot of songs sounded the same. Waiting for another Phenomenal Album like her very first. Disappointed.
0	Ledisi is less than average...there, it had to be said! if hating on this album is wrong, then i'ma be wrong. being a good poet doesn't always equate to being a good recording artist. she is definitely different than anything else being offered out there now, and i'll always give an artist props for originality, but i'm just jaded and expect more for my money. this just doesn't move me, sorry.
0	Sounded like a Mexican band; not country; not my style.  Every song sounded the same; no variety.  If you're looking for country, this isn't for you.
0	I Wont buy any of her music its not good!  She does not have any talent! Do not  waste your money!!!
0	This was the worst rendition of music that I have ever heard. It is a no name CD ie. it does not come from any music producer. Do not waste your time or money.
0	The crowd cheering drowns out a good part of the actual music...basically, I couldn't really here it all that well.
0	I shazamed a track and Amazon MP3 took me to this one claiming this was what I was looking for.  The sample wasn't long enough to really verify so it looks like I'm out of a dollar.  Anyway, it a trance track with a very annoying noise the entire duration.  It's not the worse thing I've ever heard but I wouldn't voluntarily listen to it again
0	I have no respect for this type of rap music. There is no message, no flow, nothing. It's 100% image. You could kick a typewriter down a staircase and come up with better rhymes than this fool.
0	This song is awful. Way to slow and its the same words over and over again. One star is my rating.
0	I bought a few recordings after seeing a TV program featuring this artist. I really enjoyed watching him preform. I didn't care for just listening to the recording. For me, the enjoyment comes from watching & listening, not just listening.
0	I guess you had to be part of the scene.
0	None
0	Disappointing.  I'm used to the more aggressive sound from Neck of the Woods or Swoon.  This doesn't have any of the driving power of the other two and is, frankly, annoying.  What happened to this band?
0	i only liked a few songs on it.  it's nice if you like the slow stuff and lots of it.
0	The Smithereens should cool it with the cover songs and solo projects and get back to being a song-writing group again.
0	Jesus music at its worst, this music doesn't connect anybody with god, whatever that may be. This is music for the brainwashed.d
0	Their previous stuff is much better and I will continue to listen to that and not this.  I wasted my $.
0	This is the second album i've downloaded from amazon that was "clean" - yet it wasn't mentioned on the page that the version i was downloading was edited.  What a waste of money.  Great album - Amazon needs to get their crap together unless they want torrents to seem like a better option.
0	The CD was whack  but the videos were really good but imna major big fan of neyo
0	I listened to one of her interviews and expected it to be jazzy.  It was not.  No, I will not recommend it to my friends.
0	Mystery - I order this music was billed for it but never could find it - not downloaded to my computer or that cloud thing - never found it??
0	Perhaps Adele is just too young to be able to give a Bond theme the style & sophistication it requires. Many others have tried and failed (a-ha, Tina Turner--yes, I said it!, Sheryl Crow, Chris Cornell), but at least Adele's previous work has suggested that if anyone making music today could be conscious enough to pull it off it might be her. However, her articulation alone is what prevents this from taking off at all. "Skyfoooow" & "crumbooo" simply demonstrate the regal nature she neglected to appraoch a potentially legendary track. It has nothing to do with her accent, either--after all Shirley Bassey is Welch! Who should have been tapped for this? Grace Jones truly would have sent "Skyfall" into the stratosphere.
0	Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.
0	The song is great, but this digital download is only part of the song. If you're looking for the full song, you need to just buy the CD for a penny and $3.99 for the shipping. A letdown!
0	It's not so much Jewel sold out but Jewel shows on this CD that she has aristically sold-out.  This is simply a dull, lukewarm collection of machine generated songs that offer no reason to listen to again.  Where's that edgy young artist who said Bukowski was one of her major influences?  Her and Liz Phair should start a support group for aging thirty-something female pop stars who think they should be Avril.(Oh, Jewel isn't that old?  She sure acts like it...)  I have to re-evaluate her old stuff.   "If I could tell the world just one thing...that you're okay...."   I think Jewel proves on this CD the true depth of her previous stuff.
0	Although I love Marvin Gaye and he does a good enough rendition of this lovely tune,  I had thought I bought the version with Tammi Turrell which is outstanding!
0	I was quite excited when i bought the album due to my loving the song wagnsta. After hearing the other songs on the cd i went and sold it...It was that bad. His cd was a one hit wonder. Even his new song in da club [was bad]. So i say if you are going to buy this album because you like 50's two songs and think that there will be others just as good you are wrong . Dont waste your money.
0	Was expecting all Bruno Mars music, and that's not what I got. Total waste of my money.
0	It's not the supplier's fault. I'm sorry, but I fault Amazon for not allowing samples to be heard regarding this. In the past, when I bought cd's from Amazon, I was always able to listen to samples before I purchased. Now, at least with this one, I couldn't find any list of music titles nor I was I able to hear any samples. I was looking for some particular music played by Christian Ferras and Herbert von Karajan. This cd was the only one I was able to find with the combo. I hoped it had the music I wanted in it and took the risk. But no, it didn't. I know Arthur Rubinstein's collection of Christian Ferras and Herbert von Karajan has what I want. But I couldn't find that cd. If you can, please let me know. Thank you. K
0	Not the best cd around.  Definately not something that you really want to play with the kids around.  Not very family oriented.
0	It was all downhill from here.  Bruce is worn out from the Slavery tour and the songs just don't cut it.  There's hardly a decent lick on the album and there no fun in it.  They seem to be having so much more fun on Powerslave, particularly with:  Back in the Village, Aces, 2 Minutes.  Harris has run out of ideas:  Alexander is just a terrible rehash of Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  And what went wrong with chorus's;  repeating a song's title over and over again:  "Heaven Can Wait! Heaven Can Wait! Heaven Can Wait!"  or "Caught Somewhere in Time! Caught Somewhere in Time! Caught Somewhere in Time!" is just lame.  Me and my mates tried to like this when it came out.  But in the end it was no good...the next album was no better.  End of Maiden and Metallica just blew them away with Puppets.
0	Pretty poor sound quality.  Probably on the original recording.  Sounds very compressed.
0	Ok, first off, these guys are very talented musically.  Enough so that I downloaded the album seeing as it was only $8.99.  One problem, which, surprised me, after having been to their myspace and amazon page.  This is heavily influenced Christian music.  The lyrics, unless you can handle being preached too, are VERY up front with their faith in Jesus and God and stuff. I was taken aback by this, as there is just no mention of anything of the sort, unless you read the online liner notes or lyrics they have posted at the album site, which of course I did not do until after I had purchased.  If you like that, or can get past it you will probably enjoy the album a lot, but for anyone interested who is averse to being preached to in music, check out their website, and have a peek at their lyrics before you make this purchase.  [...]
0	The song is longer. I thought i paid for the whole thing and was given only a single verse. Disappointed to say the least.
0	Unexpectedly vulgar. Too bad, as we searched all over for this in stores to no avail. Went to Amazon, got it, and can't listen to this with kids around. I see the explicit lyrics advisory, but the filth is so pervasive, skipping to the next song only cues up more vulgarity. The man has talent, but for some reason feels he needs to work blue. Too bad.
0	didn't relax me like the other tapes i have where they use a soft voice to relax and ease you into it.
0	I have to agree with Kimberly.  I learned this wonderful song almost 30 years ago, and have been singing it ever since.  But how on earth did that awful, interruptive bit get added on a the end?  Totally destroys the feeling of the song.
0	The song Precious is just a little bit odd. Not necessarily Lifehouse material. Wouldn't recommend, unless you love all their songs
0	only 1 song!!! not what I paid for, I paid for a whole CD!! sending this one back!!!
0	Don't buy this CD. You would be better off buying the Intution and Stand singles. I was so disappointed at this CD. Jewel you aren't a diamond. Go back to your old style.
0	Sum 41 give punk a bad name. Sum 41 take the Green Day/Blink 182 vein and play all the MTV clichs of what MTV think punk is. The image of punk that MTV is some bored teenager with piercings, hoodie, big baggy pants, and a skateboard. This poppy nonsense is just silly and goofy. This is not hard! Even Blink 182 are more real than these guys.  If you are between the age of 11 to 15, i can see you into this. Then you realize these guy are pandering MTV creations.
0	Don't remember buying this.  It's not so good.
0	This is a 45 RPM 12" vinyl album!  I can't play it easily and returned it unopened.  I don't understand the purpose of making it 45 RPM.  The stylus pickup is a mechanical devise, what is the advantage of forcing the stylus to follow the undulations in the groove in less time?  I don't get it !  The music may be good, but I'll never know.
0	Sorry Jon, but your version of this wonderful song just doesn't cut the mustard after hearing it done by Ellie Goulding.  Buy her bonus track on Amazon from the album "Burn" and you won't be disappointed.  Play this version after you hear hers and you will be disappointed.  Beautiful song, but for a beautiful version of a beautiful song you must hear Ellie Goulding do it.
0	1 am neither a Rhianna fan or a Kenya West fan. Am a Huge Paul McCartney fan tho. Haven't heard this song yet, but I bet it Sucks!!
0	Terrible theme song for any James Bond film. Really disappointing, especially after how good Adele's Skyfall
0	not as good as I expected from  Don Henley
0	I liked just two of the Dylan songs. The other two aren't so good and the rest of the music is uninspiring
0	this has to be the worst album lil wayne has made. the old (lights out) block is hot, the carter lil wayne use to kill. ever since he swiched his style up he fell off hard! and a lot of these songs i heard months and months ago i thought they were on some underground mix tape or something. it seems like he lost his effort and drive to make good music. overall this album gets one star for the lack of effort and good music.
0	If he is now targeting 13yo pubescent girls......mission accomplished. Long time RT/Matchbox and I'm not so sure this isn't just a bad joke.
0	First of all, let me preface this by saying that I have all of the rest of Andy's albums and will continue to buy them because I love what he is doing.  This album is nothing like his previous works. While this album makes a big change in sound and style, I really cannot say that I like it. I loved the sound that he had with his previous works, but this is something that is much slower and much less passionate. I found myself clicking through the songs looking for good parts and then having to force myself to go back and listen to the tracks again just to see if there was something I missed.  Other people that prefer a R&B sound with some random rapping thrown in, will probably be much more inclined to like this album. If you are expecting the awesome rap heavy songs that have been key in previous albums you will be sorely disappointed, like myself. All of that said, the lyrics are really good and the words are just as awesome as they have always been. Just not in a way that I enjoy to listen to.
0	This is a total scam! The songs are not by the original artists! I wish I had read the other comments before buying this collection of junk.
0	It came in a cardboard cover,not a hardcover and it sounded like am radio.
0	Found CD just okay, would not purchase again.
0	Fix it Amazon, this is getting to be a tired way of selling so so music, click on d/l and auto billing does the rest :-(
0	It is Shannon, but a 20 year older Shannon..her voice did not have that youthful edge..buy the original!!!
0	This CD is very hard to understand.  The speaker speaks very fast and does not have a soothing voice.  It did not shut off automatically in my CD player.
0	song was not what I thought it was ... but downlowded good
0	I'm sorry but this cover is really creepy and I won't consider buying the album no matter whether the songs are great or not.  Can't stand looking at the cover of the album.  I have bought some ZBB before and really like their stuff, but can't get past the cover on this one! Yuck!
0	It didn't download as an mp3 file, so unsure how I'll put it on my mp3 player.  It is one of those files that you have to select a file to open it.  Not a big deal, only 99 cents, and I'll never purchase "mp3"s from Amazon again, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me :-)  I've purchased other mp3s online and I'll stick with those vendors.
0	Not really that good. It's okay if you're looking for a background playing kind of holiday sampler.
0	I really don't do drugs (other than legal ones like caffeine), but in listening to this song again, I can't understand why I downloaded it, except for the fact it is free; but if it isn't very good, why download it?  Anyway, after listening to it a couple of times (to make sure I wasn't missing anything), I feel the song is only worth two stars, and I am planning to delete it from my ipod.  I guess everyone makes mistakes; maybe it was a senior moment for me (since I am over 65).
0	This album is a huge disappointment. Not only did they simplify their sound more than ever, but Phil is caught complaining on here about scene kids bitching about his music. I mean really? Grow up dude. Ruined it for me.
0	-sigh- Even Adam's gorgeous voice cannot pull off this terrible song. I could go on forever on how much this song sucks...:\ I give it 2 stars because Adam is an amazing singer in general.
0	All of Jewel's past albums have been commercially successful and she's formed an enormous fan base over the years, so why sell-out now and make pop-crap for the masses of teeny-boppers who think Shakira or Justin Timberlake are tallented?  It's as though it's a joke...just an entire album's worth of a joke, but I'm sure this was what the record company told her to do, because they wanted to sell a few more records and give Clearchannel something to play on all of their stations across the US all summer.  I hope no other great artists fall as Jewel seems to have.
0	too expensive
0	This is not original music. It's a bunch of crap from a handful of bands played decades later.
0	Welcome to obscurity...Wait, we were already there.
0	I tried to play this movie yesterday and it won't play.  It says Invalid Region.  What does that mean.
0	Bought this as a gift for a family member who loves musicals.  The song titles do not appear on screen when they are playing. Very frustrating!!
0	the basic song is there but some of the subtle little accents that were in the original are missing such as the double slight piano echo of the origina.
0	Listen to Dr dre or NWA.  Much better than this caca.  Hip hop is sucky now adays, Public enemy should come and bring tha noise back again. In the end flo rida sux and so does that minaj thing.
0	I was extreamly annoyed and upset when i got my CD's and the Ten New Songs , would not play and when i looked up were to send it back for replacement i foundd out Amazon will not tale bacl any CD's  that have been opened .. how can i know that it won't play with out opening it and trying to hear the music . i will not be buying any more CD's from Amazon . the book service is fine if expencif but don't try the CD"s meg
0	These are definitely not the same singers and musicians that made the hits famous. Someone suggested that the band's history included many changes to the members. Clearly, this collection of individuals weren't as good as the ones that reached all of us during the eighties. So for those of you looking for the songs we heard and loved on the radio, THESE ain't them.
0	Paul Stanley is an icon from my past, too. I respect him a lot today, as well. He's accomplished a lot in his life. But getting better as a songwriter is not one of those accomplishments. This album proves that completely.  The songs are almost all instantly forgettable. I can remember only one chorus, and that is the title track, and mainly because of its inclusion on a hilarious edition of South Park. The lyrics? Something a middle-schooler would write. Cheesier than cheetos topped with cheese. I mean, geez, man, you're in your 50s now. Can't you offer some better insights into life on your long-awaited solo album beyond crappy teenage breakups and fortune cookie sayings about "living life to the fullest"? Just awful. Motivational speaker awful.  The music? It was recorded by tons of session players, and that's exactly how it sounds - music made by people paid to play it, not by people with passion for the music.  Paul wrote some amazing songs during his early KISS days. Some absolute classics. By his own admission in recent interviews, he can't write like that anymore. That well has run dry. Now he's trying to re-write a poor man's Bon Jovi album with complete wastes of space like Desmond Child and the beyond horrific Diane Warren. Absolute garbage, throwaway, soulless wallpaper music.  Paul's solo album with KISS was great. Some really strong writing on there and great performances. But like KISS, he's gone the way of the wussy as he's aged, and he shows on this album once and for all that he has nothing original to bring to the table anymore, nothing at all interesting outside of KISS. I mean, 28 years to come up with ... THIS? And only 10 songs, at just over 30 minutes? Actually, that's probably a good thing judging from the way those 30 minutes sound.  Great voice, great part of rock history, but, like every member of KISS (except maybe Ace at times) not cut out to go it alone.
0	I intentionally searched for clean radio version and that is not what I received although it was what it claimed to be! Disapointed.
0	I must say I was totally dissapointed in the direction this album took.  This album is all 17th century romantic poetry spoken over halfhearted,  uninspired piano music. It is almost insufferable if you compare it to  previous beautifully dark albums like PSALMS FROM INVOCATIONS Unless you  are a drama major and like 17 th century romantic poetry spoken aloud.  this album is DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU!
0	It was to go go for me.
0	The singer's voice is like male Natalie Merchant.  He looks different on the album cover than on the TV.  I found these Christian alt songs refreshing b/c everything else is secular, even Catholics view it as such.   "Don't you know God made you something electric.." here he is reiterating an important Biblical principal,  that everyone is special  in God's eyes.
0	Haven't I heard this one already?  Same old stuff for last 10 years.  Where's the Kid Rock I love?
0	Why on earth would they put a song like "Jealous" on a kids' CD? Even taking out select words, the theme is ludicrous for little ones who don't need to be thinking about insecurity in relationships. We've liked Kidz Bop a lot in the past for fun and silly music but I won't get this one.
0	My computer says my browser will not play cloud. I was trying to find out how to sent to the place that says mp3 player. I wanted to know if I could put the song on the mp3 player itself. I could never get my e-mail to you to send to find out. I already know the song  is beautiful. I also heard her dad sing it who wrote the song. I'd buy lots of songs if I could buy them for my mp3 player.
0	Wished that I hadn't gotten it. Don't know how to delete this off the music program. One thing I need to learn is how to delete things off of here.
0	Exelent Doo-WAP!  Just a GREAT all around OLDIE.  LOVE IT!  Also, the STEREO recording was well done with WIDE SEPERATION.
0	So disappointed in this album. Sounds mainstream. Sounds like the same drum beat on half the songs. No banjo..no banjo? Crazy! Nothing folk like happening in this one. Wish I could get my money back. I will never pre-order another album in my life.
0	as much as i love most of travers work, i was thrilled with seeing he put out a blues c.d.  he is an awesome guitar player but this disc misses in so many aspects.... for me the vocals are so horrible that i cant stand to listen to it at all... very dissapointed and i wouldnt recommend this at all.... of course this is my opinion but as a lover of the blues this misses big time.....
0	Another Rock bad sliding down to country music. Sad and pathetic. Rock & Roll IS dying people and partly because fans allow bands we love to produce C-R-A-P like this.
0	A big problem; it was easy to buy but apparently impossible to download to my Itunes player.  Is Amazon going up against all of us who use Itunes?
0	Not the female French singer. Songs are bad too, so I can't even try to be ok with the purchase.
0	Elvis impersonators are bad enough, but the conceit of this misbegotten project -- a collection of songs popularized by the likes of Celine Dion and David Foster performed in woeful Elvis caricature -- marks a new low in crass exploitation.  For all his cartoonish, over-the-top swagger, our would-be Elvis proves his non-connection with the genuine article by covering John Lennon's "Imagine," an undeniably great song but one Elvis would have steered clear of because of it's "Imagine there's no Heaven..." lyric.  Sad.
0	If you are a fan of those great early Partridge Family albums, then you owe it to yourself to get these, the 1993 Razor & Tie versions and not the recent re-masters of 2000 and 2003. Why? Razor & Tie did not tamper with the sound quality, as a result, Razor & Tie CD's sound like the records you remember. I made the mistake of buying the re-masters thinking they would sound even greater; NOT!
0	What in the world is this? I'm suprised they haven't been sued for ripping Reggie off. Even the song titles are rip off's of Reggie songs, Bonnie 2K, whatever = Megan 2K. I don't know maybe it's just some joke they are doing, but even if it is a joke this is a seriously lame-o cd.
0	Bought this for my friend as a birthday present. I'm really upset because I had amazon deliver it directly to her rather than to me to mail it to her with extra birthday goodies (since she lives across the country) solely because I didn't want to accidentally damage it myself but it happened anyway. I don't know if it was just a manufacturer's defect or a shipping error but I'm very upset. Usually very satisfied with amazon's quality but this time not so much.
0	DIDN'I  HAVE  ALL  THE  RIGHT  PRODUCT
0	Label pealing off on bonus LP. Not worth the effort to return. Fantastic albums though!
0	Not a fan of this group. For some reason they just hit me as the type of people who would support their friend even if he were a rapist. Just because you know somebody does not mean you need to come to their support and defend them after they commit heinous crimes.
0	The download version has some major problems with some of the audio files.  It's not the normal pops, clicks, and hiss you'll hear from material dubbed from 78s.  Several of the tunes have a sort of phasing effect similar to what happens when somemone has applied electronic noise reduction too heavily.  It's too bad.  This is some great music.  Martin is a gem.  Because of the audio problems I would have rated this no stars if the option were available.
0	For the price I couldn't beat the very few good songs I received so I purchased it.  Most tracks are drawn out beats...
0	Kids already have NOW cd's, why do we need this?  I mean, any kid that could actually tolerate this actually listens to the radio and would rather have the actual song, not some stupid, cheap remake of the song with kids singing in the background.  If you want a CD with kids singing along with it, just get a kids barney sing a long tape or something.  I mean, i'm not a parent or a strict conservative but some of these songs are by artists definately not meant for kids. Smash mouth (all star), Blink 182 (all the small things), sugar ray (fly) and more all have parental advisory stickers on a couple of their albums.  The only reason they make this is to get your money, and you have good reason not to get it!
0	As it turns out, this is NOT the Motion Picture soundtrack. It is the score, which is a very different thing. I bought this as a gift for someone who loved the songs in the film, and it was very embarrassing when it ended up being the instrumental score version. This should be clearly labeled by Amazon. This was my first disappointed experience ordering from Amazon.
0	When I heard that David Draiman was putting together a side project while Disturbed was taking a break from recording/touring I was excited.  After listening to this album, all I can say is Meh.  These songs could have been part of the Disturbed catalog (with a little tweaking).  There is not a lot of separation in the sound that screams "This is industrial metal" to me.  Actually, the only truly industrial sounding tune on the whole album is the cover of NIN's "Wish".  Not a terrible album, just not what I had hoped for though
0	Dreadful recording!  It is the audio version of potato salad without the mayonaise, many well-executed notes but no music.  I threw it out and will look for a Russian performance that has some soul.
0	When it has came down to Mariah Carey in her songs, she just really doesn't deliver anymore in regards to voice, sonnet and soul in regards to her songs each and every time. Sadly, the last several songs she had put out like #Beautiful and the lackluster Triumphant from 2012 have been less than stellar in regards to voice and absolute spirit. Sadly, with the songs she has came out with from her upcoming album The Art Of Letting Go, they just haven't added up in regards to voice and spirit in what Mariah had been known for. Her latest song You're Mine Eternal is not one of Mariah's better songs, and feels weak in her voice and soul in what a love song can really be. The song alone is not really anything worth raving about, but remixed with Trey Songz on the song, feels worse in voice and spirit. As for Trey Songz, he has had better collaboration with other divas like Toni Braxton a few years ago with Yesterday which was more sensual and delivered better in the mood. I think Mariah needs to really go back to what her a good singer to start with, otherwise she should retire.  Song: D+
0	This guy...lolz come on. I don't even know how this got downloaded.
0	I didn't like this album that much. I might have to warm up to it, but it didn't give a good first impression.
0	I played it a few times and it skips, poor quality.
0	All I know about music is whether not I like it.  Josh, you missed it on this one.  Whoever produced this put you in the worst possible key most of the time.  We have all heard the songs, but not as they sound here.  As a fan of  yours, you need to fire your producers.
0	Similar to Koi, this newest album "Gore" continues to stray further away from the heavy style of early tones and fully embraces the monotonous airy sounds of team sleep and chinos various other "atmospheric" musical projects. With a title like Gore I was fully expecting a return to form, maybe not a White Pony 2, but not this either. Gore is just...boring. That's pretty much the only way I can describe it. The last tones show I went to was back in 2010. To support diamond eyes. And I hate to say it, but that's probably the last one I will ever attend. Not recommended.
0	My wife needed the soundtrack for a classroom exercise and was in a time crunch.  We started the preview and assumed this was the original, so we downloaded it only to find out there's only about 20 seconds of the original soundtrack and then something like clocks ticking afterwards for the balance of the time.  A total misrepresentation and ripoff.
0	Not what I was expecting
0	There's only a handful of decent songs on here. She has turned into a pop artist through and through, and it is often difficult to find a hint of her country roots. There are some catchy songs on here, don't get me wrong, but I feel as if TSwift has regressed in age in a majority of them. Instead of sounding like a mature, young adult, she has written and recorded songs that sound as if she is 15 and clearly are intended for that audience (think "Never Ever Getting Back Together"). Huge disappointment for a long time Taylor fan! If her next album doesn't reflect an understanding that she let a lot of her original fans (I've loved her since "Teardrops on My Guitar" first came on the radio!), then I'll have to realize she just sold out and I'll need to find another young artist to cheer for. Maybe I'll just switch teams to Hunter Hayes anyway...So far he seems consistently country!!
0	I ordered two copies of the vinyl, one for myself and one as a gift. The albums received were completely different. Ordered a replacement and even that one was wrong.
0	Seriously, could this be any more difficult??  I don't want the cloud, i just want the download i paid for ON MY COMPUTER to put into my already existing and quite capable iTunes!  I can't even find a record (aside fromt the email I received) that shows i purchased this much less a way to actually use it.  I had hoped to use it this morning for our school chapel, but i've been messing with this for 3 days, and still can't figure it out.  YIKES!!  Insert sad face here...
0	This recording disappoints because right in the first track for plie, the pianist can not hold a steady tempo. It has way too much rubato which slows down and speeds up in a way that doesn't give you a steady tempo to work with. Has this guy ever played for a ballet class before? Disappointing.
0	to begin with, i think jewel is absolutely amazing. her music has always contained thought provoking lyrics that are socially aware and achingly vulnerable, yet with a sense of hope laced in somewhere. although i was only 11 at the time, her beautiful, heart-wrenching 1994 debut "pieces of you" also proved to me that she could hold her own on the guitar by embracing chords with an endearing clumsiness and infectious creativity that i have yet to find in any other artist today. jewel's the real deal because you know she could get up on a stage with nothing but a guitar strapped around her body and blow almost any other pop ingenue out of the water with her powerful voice.  so then, where is that jewel? i don't believe i've ever felt more disappointed in an album or by an artist. having grown up on her music, having attended numerous concerts, i have a hard time buying this is who jewel really is and who she will continue to be. i'm all for artistic growth, and i believe that artists should continue to expand their horizons; in this area i do applaud jewel's bravery. madonna invented reinvention. however images are a hard thing to shatter and jewel has spent 10 years fine tuning her own. so just as reinvention is part of madonna's image, an acoustic guitar and playful, sensitive lyrics are a part of jewel's. call me closeminded and maybe i am, but i'm sorry, i don't have any interest in dancing to a jewel song, and never will. that's why we have a revolving door of about 500 pop artists crowding mtv today.  jewel's greatest prowess has always been her ability to appeal to a mainstream audience by creating music that mainstream audiences don't generally show much interest in. with "0304" (which sadly enough, i'm willing to bet will be her biggest selling album since pieces of you), jewel succumbs to the pressures of staying a superstar and crafts a record that is undeniably catchy but ultimately substandard in comparison to the bar of excellence she herself has set.
0	I did not purchase this item, and it isn't listed under my account.  Why am I getting emails to review items that I didn't purchase?
0	another corny ass dance song for the Hialeah Soccer Mom crowd and the little Miami Teenybopper crowd. The singer, Havana Brown, i am assuming she's called, sounds like a low rent Rihanna. In other words, an un-unique, pedestrian dance pop singer that sounds like every other dance pop singer on the radio. Not the absolute worst song out there, but pretty awful neverthelesss.
0	My daughter picked this song.  It is so bad.  These guys need to go away, far away.  The apocalypse is near.
0	Great idea, unfortunately the other reviews fail to point out that, to my ears, (listen to the cricket sounds) this appears to be a small sound sample on a 1-2 min sound loop....you are getting the same exact bird and cricket sounds over and over and over. I have skipped all the way in small increments to the end of the 1 hr length and the same exact sound repeats itself on regular minute intervals. Pretty cheesy and once your brain figures it out, not very relaxing....Of course the sample is not long enough to figure this out-you have to purchase it to get past the first loop.
0	Was disappointed to discover that this uses synthetic sounds for large parts of this score.  Almost every major symphony does this live for Xmas, why not record the real sounds? Would not recommend
0	Since I must make a statement. I love this song to death.  Great song!  Great music!  Great Artists! Great Everything!
0	Ok Elvis I know you have new twins and formula is expensive but come on quit trying to rip off your fans! How many more reissues are you going to pawn off on us. Why not just release a series of reissues or rarities like the Bootleg Series from Dylan. Fans are getting fed up with the repackaging and the whorish behavior.
0	Paid for express shipping to receive it on time as a gift. Gets here on time (great) give it as a surprise gift (awesome) open it (not so awesome):  Undamaged packaging, instantly upon opening both records are covered with lint. It looks like someone wiped them on their grandparent's wool sweater before putting them in the sleeves.  Black streaks on the white vinyl. Not ON the vinyl, IN the vinyl. As if mixed in with the white plastic.  Put in on the record player, starts skipping like it's playing hopscotch and the sound coming out of it would suddenly transform into the sounds of a satanic chant. I even had to check to see if I accidentally put on my "Best Of: Satanic Chants of the 70's" album by mistake. Surely this isn't the angelic voice of Matthew Healy.  Amazon, for the second time you have disappointed me with an unsatisfactory vinyl album, shame on me for trusting you a second time with that simple task. But this time you have gone so far as to soil the sweet, soothing voice of Matthew Healy, and that is unforgivable.
0	Wanna talk about the overhyped artists? Justin Timberlake, Usher and 50 Cent. You wnna know why he is named 50 cent? Cuz thats all he is worth. This man has no talent. No rap artists have talent. Oh they can talk fast with a beat.  Big deal. Thats not music. You wanna talk about music? How about the real artists who make true music who use their voices to convey important messages, not messages about raping and murdering enemies. Real music is Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and Vanessa Williams.
0	Did not sound luke original singer
0	The sound was bad.
0	Don't remember getting this..
0	I just don't llike it  . I wanted the song to do the line dance but I find tha I like doing the line dance to the instrumental Goota give it Up.
0	I was so excited to listen to this new album from one of my old favorite bands only to be disappointed by a continuation of the simplistic melodies and basic arrangements introduced on their last release "Keep Your Eyes Ahead".  I find it hard to believe that losing one's voice & learning to sing again has emptied Brandon Summer's head of innovative musical ideas, interesting guitar work, and amazing instrument flavors in his arrangements ... all the things that made this band great at one time.  PLEASE go back & listen to their three earlier albums - especially "Complex" and "Love & Distance" and you will see what I mean.  The songs from those albums all had interesting chord progressions, cool melodies, & complex and interesting arrangements. Those albums were a feast (and sometimes a challenge) for the ear.  The songs and arrangements on this new album are boring & quite basic by comparison.  Man, this new album is a snore.  what a huge disappointment!
0	Doesn't sound like the original.
0	Sorry Brandy I love you but this CD is a borefest!
0	This is truly ghastly!  Whatever possessed someone to so botch such a beautiful melody by trying to turn it into some sort of modern jazz piece?  I almost lost my lunch.  I have already determined that due to the extremely poor quality of electronic devices Amazon foists upon the public that I will never again buy any from them, I see now that the same is true for recorded music.  After the experience of listening to this musical abortion I doubt I could stand listening to any of the other pieces.  I will still buy books from Amazon, but this company would be well advised to never sell anything other than books.  At least Amazon can do that right.  If you truly appreciate the titles in this album, you would be well advised to avoid these tragic examples of them.
0	Worst stand up album I have ever purchased.  Neither funny, nor interesting.  By the sounds of the audience they enjoyed it about as much.--A rather disappointed Professor Blastoff fan
0	As I understand from the Steely Dan website, this is not an authorized SD release.  They mention on their site that there are numerous bootleg demo and concert CDs out on the market, and unfortunately, Amazon has not escaped this phenomenon.  I agree wholeheartedly with the earlier poster...don't waste your money.  For more info on this, check out the official Steely Dan website (specifically, their list of "album-length, authorized, commercial (for sale) releases:  [...]
0	after a great first cd. this was real disappointing.not even in the same ballpark as their other disc,still not feeling it after muliple times listening to it . Very disappointed
0	Actually, I love it but I can't download it to actually hear it!!! Hey Amazon, please fix your download tool.
0	Good Holiday music
0	The point of this review is to complain to Amazon about the one click purchase buttons on the *right side* of the browser.  I was aiming for the album image and accidentally hit the purchase button.  Amazon, Please keep the purchase buttons on the top left corner.  Normal people do not buy an album based on its cover.  Since I now *own* this album and can't return it,  I'll go ahead and right a review.  I apologize in advance to the Daft Punk band who I am sure are nice people.  Overall this album consists of repetitive electronics spiced with drunk audience screaming their heads off.  It probable should be experienced after a couple of six packs.  Track 1 Interesting sounds in the beginning.  The overload synth sound makes an appearance here.  However there are long stretches where it sounds like they left the synthesizer on replay while they grabbed a beer.  Track 2 Sounds interesting but is fatally marred by a repeated swear word.  I don't see an explicit label on the album so this looks like an oversite by Amazon.  Track 3 Looks like mindless repetition is a trademark.  First half is booorrring.  Second half ends with a flourish.  Track 4 Occasional cool sounds suffocated by endless repetition.  Track 5 Nothing special. They do sing a few words.  Track 6 My 6 year old calls this song "weird".  The second half sounds like a needle stuck on a turntable.  Of course the live audience is too young to remember turntables so perhaps this is attractive.  All I can say is "please end!!!".  Track 7 This sounds like an actual song.  However the tune sounds like someone wiping spilled beer  off the keyboard while it is plugged in.  Track 8 is the best song so far.  The keyboard work is impressive even though the tune sounds like a disco song.  Unfortunately the band does not know when to quit and the song quickly degrades into repetition again.  Track 9 has a good start.  It sounds like Peter Frampton doing disco. Unfortunately it disintegrates into a cacophony of malfunctioning electronics.  The title Brainwasher is appropriate.  Track 10 is not worth your time.  I listened so you won't have to.  Track 11 is a truly annoying song.  Perhaps it sounds better when played backwards.  Track 12 spends about one minute repeating the one more time song.  The remaining 9 minutes are spent dancing around one note to the point that you need to take a medication to stop the ringing inside your head.
0	Cd was not bad but the last track towards the end of the track the sound broke in and out and finally stopped playing. It was too expensive for an incomplete cd.  Its a shame because the last track is one of my favorite songs and the fact that the last portion of the song unplayable kills it.
0	Trash.
0	I cannot believe how low people's musical tastes have dropped over the past few years. This drivel is given over 100 5 star reviews!?!?!?! Are you serious!?!??! It isn't about how she compares with older R&B/soul divas (she doesn't) or how contrived and boring her lyrics are (Your going to rehab? congrats!!), the fact is that people like this album BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD TO.
0	not my purchase
0	Only liked 2 songs major bummer
0	Not even going to bother with this unless they are 320kb quality. Why even bother with something low quality? seriously.
0	No one can replace Jon Anderson. They need to "hang it up". Will not buy another CD without Jon.
0	just as I had ordered
0	CD was scratched and skipping
0	The review could been better for this song.  Need to have a longer play time in the review part for this song.
0	Sadly, this may be my last download ever, as the software that loads the songs onto my computer has mysteriously stopped working.  Tech support has been no help - simply regurgitating the steps from the website. Looks like it will be iTunes from here on out.
0	As a Deb Talan fan, I bought this CD to get a feel for her earlier work. Her voice is amazing as always, but frankly the album as a whole is unremarkable. I'd even call a couple of songs pretty bad. But it's worth a listen anyway, and I'd still recommend giving it a shot if you're he sort who likes to collect everything you can by your favorite artists.
0	Seemed as though they just added what they thought metal is supposed to sound like parts to other wise fairly decent jams. Great idea just didn't pull it off.
0	I'm big Jewel fan really don't get me wrong! But I hate dance music and this album did not hit a single note with me at all. when I went out and bought it, I got home and put it on and isten to it all the way thought I put down and I have not listen to it at all since that day. The rest of her cd's I still love. I hope she goes back to her old style on her next album.
0	I can't believe I paid 11.99 for 2 songs! I thought I was buying a complete cd.
0	awful
0	Not the original sound to Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" I was expecting. Sound is less dramatic (no vocals) and not it's full true length to me.
0	Would not play in any of my players. Could only access it on my computer and then it wouldn't play in my players if I made a different CD.
0	Has Hillsong lost its spirit? Sounds like songs made up for a factory music business. Come Holy Spirit and help!
0	Fair condition. ...not nearly as good as expected.... Plus had to complain about the first One as it was so bad. They did replace it but it does have some scratching in the sound .... Buyer beware.
0	Heard this song , many years ago.  The flute in the background is charming .  Very catchy little piece.  LOVE IT
0	Whoever encoded the titles of the songs wrote them down all wrong. On disc 1 everything it out of order or listed inaccurately.
0	At the time this album came out I was graduating high school, going into the college. My favorite music was and still is hard rock and metal. As a guitarist I was influenced by REAL PLAYERS like Eddie Van Halen, George Lynch, etc. I never liked this album. When Rolling Stone Magazine did a 100 greatest guitar player list they ahad the nerve to put Cobain higher on the list than Eddie Van Halen. His guitar playing sucks and so does his singing. These whiny songs brought about the crappy grunge movement with other crappy bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. Cobain has been compared to the likes of John Lennon, how can that be? He wasn't around long enough and he was just a druggie who got lucky. Being married to Courtney Love doesn't say much for him either, no wonder he killed himself. The 90's became a bleaker place because of this band. To this day I still don't understand why MTV and the record industries kissed their ass and tossed aside real talented bands. I don't know what they were smoking in Seattle but at least they produced some good bands like Queensryche and Heart.
0	Didn't like the songs
0	As others have stated, this is NOT the radio edit.  I purchased this song for my children's tablet as they fell in love with it from the Disney commercials.  I was appalled when they were playing it and I heard the language.  I have contacted Amazon and requested that they correct this issue.  We'll see if it happens.  But, please do NOT purchase this for your children.
0	Not a match for me.  Does not mean it is bad.  I just could not get into this one.
0	This is a great album but the record quality is terrible
0	Not happy with this track at all.  It was some odd dance beat remix.  You have to pay very close attention before purchasing and make sure you listen to the sample to make sure you get exactly what you wanted.
0	I never ordered this item!
0	I had watched the season that Jordin was on in American Idol. I had heard this song on the radio (probably too much?) and decided to download today based on a snippet I heard today.... I have to say I like the song, but the ending is really [...]... of course now given the whole Chris Brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general, but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and overly emotional notes that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it goes along to prove they have singing ability. And it seems to go along tooooo long. I know you can both sing... Modern day Air Supply. Blech.... But might appeal to a lot of people. Just not me. Just my opinion :)
0	It is my favorite song but I had only listened to the radio version. Having the F word in it just takes away from my enjoyment, it doesnt add to it. I was disappointed to know it has that. Yes, I saw the word explicit. Yes, I realize it is in there but that doesnt change how I feel.
0	Wrong song!  Don't one this one.
0	Only had 1 fairly good cut on it very sorry I bought the cd!  Group was on Fox &Friends played one song was good so purchased it very disappointed with cd only one good cut on it rest was just noise.
0	Como has a really beautiful voice that's perfect for smooth ballads, but he shouldn't sing gospel.  It just doesn't suit his voice or phrasing.  If you want really good gospel buy something like the Clara Ward Singers who have made their career singing only gospel.
0	I just wasted a buck. It's not obvious to someone purchasing this song, but it is not the one you think you're going to get. This has been bleeped all to h___. I want my dollar back.
0	I did not like his spin to the song.
0	This music loses my attention in a very short period of time. Just be certain what your buying before you do.  In short, don't waste your money.
0	I wanted to buy this song but when i tried to preview it, the song is just not the one. Please check it.
0	Wasn't sad, wasn't glad. It was was just a bunch of plunky piano music, accompanied by violin.
0	Just a terrible high-pitched (hisss) sound to this greatest hits collection.  I downloaded it and immediately deleted it.  I recommend buying the album, "6 Picks: Essential Radio Hits EP", which has Sixpence's Greatest hits, without alteration, and then downloading the remaining songs from their corresponding albums.
0	I thought this item would be a little better than what it was. But it's......... Okay.
0	the video's okay only ciara acts like eartha kitt on acid other than that this sounds like one of jt's leftovers.
0	The quality of the CD is pretty poor.
0	The song green back boogie is great but cant find it. It became a hit after it starts the cable show SUITS
0	OK, I just saw the latest "workshop" of this musical, and while it's better than this original version, I personally think this needs a lot of work, but I'm not sure it's salvagable.  First, I don't think this movie is worth being made into a musical.  Secondly, I think the music needs more melody.  I think it's trying to be too "artsy" for its own good.  Thirdly, the rhyming scheme in the music is questionable.  The only way I can see this musical working is if they take a total tongue in cheek approach.  Make it fun!  Remove the attempt at seriousness, sort of like Xanadu did.  The parts that work best are definitely the humorous ones.  I'll not say anything about the ballads, but I will tell you that I definitely know that "Love is like Water", unfortunately.  Give it a listen if you want and make your own judgements, but I think this will only appeal to that broad niche of "Last Starfighter fans who love musical theatre in the style of Jason Robert Brown."  And we know that those people are everywhere...
0	First of all, this is a great song. I rock out to it whenever it is on the radio, turning it up loud. When I'm at a place that has good internet, I will turn the song on. Yes I have bad internet, probably the slowest you can get but I just had to have this song. So you are probably wondering why I hate it so much. Heres the story: I buy it for $0.97, a great deal from here compared to iTunes, or at least I thought it was at the time. Then, I waited half an hour for the song to download (bad internet), and played it, with excitement. The heavy chords started to play, and then skip. I tried many different things including turning the file into a WMA and ACC audio, but it did nothing, it still skipped. I don't know if it skipps so bad because of my internet, or because Amazon made a mistake, but I wouldn't risk buying this song if I were you! This track isn't even listenable because of how much it skipps. Do not waste your money on this track, no matter how good it is. It would be worth buying the cd anyways =D
0	this is horrible im literally in the hospital listening to this. farrah just woke my husband up from a coma and told me to turn this horrible shit off. i was surprise, at least ya saved a life with ya shitty music farrah
0	This disc does NOT work! I need a replacement! How do I accomplish that?\
0	First of all I have to echo the other low scoring reviewer's comments that the frequently mis-pronounced words distracted this listener from absorbing the material.  Written books are edited for obviously misspelled words; why wasn't this audio book edited for mis-pronounced words? Very amateurish. "So - Crates" instead of Socrates?  What is this "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"?  Secondly, I found the narrator was talking at the audience instead of to them. He was just enthusiastically reading what was in front of him without proper pauses and emphasis. It takes more than someone sounding like an Oxyclean commercial to effectively deliver a message.  Also, there were some nuggets of wisdom in this audio book.  However, I can't agree with Murphy's basic concept of the subconscious mind. I took his message as saying the subconscious mind is a separate entity within the body that has all the answers to everything; like the Oracle at Delphi. All you have to do is ask it three times per day and you will get what you want; I guess like clicking your heals three times in the "Wizard of Oz". It also has all control to automatic functions within the body like hair growth and healing.  Although I think that the subconscious mind can influence the aforementioned, those are separate systems within the human body.  I will continue my search for something that makes more sense.
0	I bought this for my 11-month old baby. She is learning both English and Spanish at home. I thought this would make it more fun for her as she loves to dance whenever she hears music. However, this doesn't seem to do the trick. The vocals are off and quite annoying. I was also hoping to see this CD in my "Amazon MP3" list so I could play it anywhere I have my smartphone (as most CDs purchased from Amazon come up there). But this one does not appear; I think because only the English version does. Not worth the money in my opinion.
0	very disappointed that when I got my CD there were only 11 song the very reason I bought the CD was for one particular song and its not even on the CD
0	This song came out in 1960 and at that time I was In the first grade.  When I would hear it on the radio, I would get really excited.  This song is one that hardly gets played on the radio as it was played back in the 60s.  For the longest time I would ask different ones' if they ever remembered the Bumble Bee song and they would give me a negative answer.  I knew the song existed and thanks to the internet I looked up the song.  I typed in "The Evil Bumble Bee song" and with some great luck I found the Bumble Bee song.  It really is a good song.  It is available on Amazon, Google Chrome and Apple, so try it you may like, it's kind of funny.
0	The CD was defective
0	Not a good remake
0	Sort of musing about how since Ronald Reagan & his crowd turned America away from itself and lied citizens into giving the really rich full control over our economy so they could steal it all away from the American people .
0	I preordered this so I was in the first group to get the CD shipped to my door.  But I waited this long to write this hoping my disappointment would change - a few DT albums didn't grab me at first and now are favorites.  This album is flat without peaks or valleys.   One of the great things about DT is that they write songs as a group. The 5 will bring in their ideas, they start jammin, and before you know it they have an album. The Astonishing is Petrucci's project (I know, he had Jordan write some of it but...).  He could have left his mates, hired some musicians, n called it The Petrucci Project.  I could almost forgive the lame n over used concept of a future without music, but those characters, c'mon.  The hero's name is Gabriel YA THINK.  The bad guy is Nefarious, really?  Even Despicable Me had a bad guy named Dr. Nefario. The music is nefario.   There is nothing exciting about this album. You reviewers that appreciate Jordan's contribution, fine, o.k, that's true. But DT fans expect some guitar driven songs. Most of this album sounds like 1980's Air Supply.  And tossing in a tasty solo to a soft pop song isn't enough; even 1970's Carpenters did that. I can't even guess how some of you guys gave this 5 stars!   In the old children's story, the Emporer rides thru town in his underwear as all the peons exclaim: look at the king's beautiful new clothes. Some of you 4 n 5 star reviewers seem to be saying: it's Dream Theater, its their best ever, and that is that. I'm like the boy in the old story who looks up and says: the king is naked.   I really wish for a new album. Can't tell if it's anywhere in our near future, they're still touring and will the rest of 2017.
0	First, he wants women to talk dirty to him. Now he wants them to shake their asses for him. Guess what bud? Women are not objects who exist solely to satisfy your sexual desires. Your girlfriend Jordin should be ashamed of dating someone like you.
0	Unable to play in windows media player. I can listen to it on amazon's cloud player but wanted it to use for a slideshow. not worth the 99 cents just to be able to listen to it only on the cloud player that I don't normally use. Plus unable to be refunded.
0	The label says SONY CLASSICAL in the back of the CD.  Little did I know this is a jazz CD.  Track 3 Azulao, Track 4 The Little Horses, and Track 5 Ninghe, Ninghe almost drove me crazy.  The jazz musicians did a good job but Kathleen sounds the same in every song.  Don't expect her to unleash her vocal range in this CD.  Kathleen should stick with classical music doing what she does best.  Jazz is just not for her.  The blue sticker on the CD states -"An unforgettable collection of love songs, lullabies, and spirituals"  What a joke.  This CD is heading to charity.  I strongly recommend checking out song previews before you buy this CD.  If you like it, buy it.  Otherwise, you will be wasting your money like I did.
0	If I had heard the complete version, I would have skipped purchasing this song.  It starts off nice but seems to leave me uninspired as it nears the end.
0	Not the original song
0	Very disappointed.  Never heard of a lot of the artist
0	this album has not agressive beats and the lyrics are not the best ,the only good thing is that is produced by dr dre, anyway if yoy like hardcore this cd is not for you- peace
0	This program did not work with windows 7. Had to return. Still waiting for reimbursement from the shipper two weeks later.
0	I love this song, BUT, the recording was garbled and didn't sound right at all. I'm not happy about this.  I waited a while to finally download it on my MP3 player only to have a bad sounding recording.  Doesn't happen often.  I don't want to have to download it again.  The song is still great though.  All the other songs on my MP3 sound just fine.  Don't know what happened with this.
0	NOT THE SOUNDTRACK.  oh well, just wasted $5
0	I bought this one and was horrified to find it was not the original version.  I was devastated to say the least.
0	A lovely version of the classic, ruined by a end section of inappropriate spoken word.  Maybe it's supposed to be funny.  It's not.  Buyers should be warned of this in the description.
0	Let me preface this by saying I am a professional audio editor so I may be more sensitive to this than most people  I only bought this recording because I want to listen to it in high quality. I knew it was an MP3, but at least its better than youtube.  I was extremely disappointed that exactly at 3:19, the climax of the piece, there are extremely loud and audible clicks, MP3 compression artifacts. I looked at it under a spectral analyzer and sure enough, its extremely visible.  So I won't be buying music from Amazon anymore, its just garbage quality.
0	There was only one real song. The rest was Instrumental like there first albums.
0	no
0	This product DID NOT DOWNLOAD PROPERLY. As a result I had to download a second time - incurring a second charge!!! I WAS ROBBED!
0	I never received it. Of course, they DID get my money, but no download. Sucks. I don't want cloud stuff, I want a real download to play regardless of internet access. I am NOT happy.
0	No Lou Reed. No Sterling Morrison. No John Cale. No Moe Tucker.  This isn't the Velvet Underground, but a Doug Yule solo album.  It's also a prime example of a record label trying to "squeeze" more money out of a band's name.  The cover art is reminiscent of Loaded's art, but I'm not sure why it depicts a hand fondling a phallic-looking Empire State Building.  This album has never been released on CD, and sometimes this album is intentionally left off of VU discographies.  If you do manage to find this album on vinyl BUY IT!  It's basically a collector's item because not many were pressed...  As for the music itself, some songs sound like they could be on Loaded.  However, a good chunk of the album is bad country music (think "Lonesome Cowboy Bill").  The first two tracks "Little Jack" and "Crash" are listenable, but it quickly goes downhill from there.
0	Pure Noise ... I really don't understand the high ratings for this album.  With the exception of the 2 Forest Flower pieces, this is almost cacophony.  If this is Free Jazz, I see no redeeming value.  Jarrett sounds like a 3 year old throwing a temper tantrum through the piano.  Lloyd's playing is distinctive and recognizable in his more recent approachable efforts.  Definitely not recommended.
0	CD not Vinyl as listed and described.
0	Dull. Flat and miscast. Pass!
0	Very disappointed.  Enjoyed the music from the original much more.
0	hard to chill on this music
0	I am tired of looking for some laid back, smooth tempo relaxing music that supposed r&b vets rate as outstanding. I have all but one of Jon B albums, the Christmas album I refuse to get. Let me state for the record, I'm A Bigg Fan Of Jon B!!! This Album is Utterly Crap!! Aka GARBAGE!!! In this pass week I brought about four cd's based on so called great music reviewers, realizing these reviewers may b about 20 to 30 years of age, not that the age is a factor but the kind of music 20 years ago vs today is not comparable to someone's judgement today if that person is not use to a musical classic, like Barry White's " I Got So Much Love To Give " Or the Temptations " Magic" With later 90's & 2000's classics like Jon B's " They Don't Know " or Jagged Edge's " Walked Out Of Heaven " or " Remedy " & who can forget New Edition"s "Boys To Men " with that said, if anyone wants to challenge me on my age & what music I refer to in my rating system I'm 49 years old & a friend of one of my favorite artist Eric Roberson. I think I'm more than qualified to say this album is pure garbage!! Like I said I'm a Bigg Fan of Jon's in ( My ) opinion his best album released to date is his Helpless Romantic! Then " Pleasures U Like " There may be a lot of reviews for his " Cool Relax " cd, but that is because there was no advertisement for " Helpless Romantic " and it was not sold in stores!!! Just so those who don't agree & think I'm bais, I have not written a review for Eric Roberson's latest project " Mr Nice Guy " because out of ALL his Albums I find this one to be just ok. Save Your Money & Make " Helpless Romantic " The Platinum Album It Should Be!!! Update!! 2/15/12 1:00pm because Mr. rikkid decided to post a comment to my blog, I've decided to listen to Mr Jon B again and decided that track 10 Do You Miss Me : Is the premier song on the album!! ( In My Opinion ) is that ok Mr Rikkid?? LOL. By the way if you like the music style u stated, I suggest you try Jamie Foxx's " Blame It On" it has everything you've stated in your rebuttal! Thanks for your post comment!
0	There is a small segment of listeners to whom this song will appeal.  It is shockingly vulgar, and while I am not a prude, and might enjoy this if I knew no one else was listening, that is not usually the case with Christmas music.  Downloaded, listened to once, deleted.  Do NOT play this around children.
0	It was extremely slow arriving and the case was all cracked and broken. I was not happy about that aspect of the product in the least.
0	I love the music.  However, Side B of the vinyl has a major manufacturing flaw with a horrible wow.
0	Ron Isley solo project is not vintage isley brothers sound, lacking in passion, was looking for the Ron isley that gave  us the classic grooves of the past four decades. this cd is a failure  to the true Isley sound.
0	Love the CD, but it took way too long in arriving!!!!!
0	Yet another abomination by the pop rapper Lil Wayne. This is kiddie rap, mainstream filth for the masses of morons. No wonder this is 5 bucks at Best Buy.
0	ordered n error
0	Not worth ten bucks, sorry. This is such a sad excuse for music and shouldn't even be posted up at all.
0	Overrated song
0	Re-hashed Dark Side Of The Moon
0	This is a cheaply produced re-creation of the original music that appears in the film.  The real deal can be found on Wendy Carlos' "Rediscovering Lost Scores" CD.  This version is like a bad karaoke version.
0	This album is o.k. I guess but as soon as I heard Fruciante left the bad again my heart sank.  He is responsible for most of the brilliant songwriting, so of course this album sounds different and inferior to past records.
0	I did not get the original cut I was hoping for. This wa a bad remake. Skip it, get the 1990's version. He can sing this a lot better than this. I don't know why there are so many different versions of this.
0	worst thing ive heard in my entire life.
0	It's seems like he has a certain opinion then immediately change it to fit the person who will benefit him in the short term...it's really a unique quality... Unfortunately I think it will catch up to him..
0	My husband listens to the CD all the time.  He heard her sing on the David Letterman show.  We heard many songs in the 60's.
0	I don't have any idea about this. I don't even know who this is. so I cant rate it. sorry.
0	Bought used, the CDs look good but play poorly, Iike scratched records, skipping any hanging up. Had same problem with another "used" order so no more used CDs for me.
0	This is not the correct song only seconds long
0	I shoul've know ... twisted sister, Christmas?  really.... what a waste of time.  Twisted Sister seemed like a good idea in the 80's but in reality we were dumb kids, and this music SUCKS!
0	The actual music is nice the lyrics are awful!
0	Boring, uninspired, generic.
0	Would like to listen to a sample before I buy product. Saw a video of her singing this song but would like to make sure audio version is the same.
0	ok
0	Record quality was horrible.  Grooves are extremely shallow therefore sound quality is very poor.  Should have returned it but ultimately it kept and is now in storage after moving.
0	Most noticeable in some otherwise-brilliant tracks such as "Radioactive" and "Demons" -- but due to the constant radio airplay the album got, people likely never were able to hear the incredibly bad distortion in the bass and other drum hits.  When listening on nice headphones, this is literally enough to ruin all the songs with hefty bass on this album. Really hope that Imagine Dragons eventually decide to re-master the problem tracks on this album and re-release it, because the intentionally-introduced distortion is an inexcusably bad decision.
0	Love this song!! I bought it to make a slideshow for my daughter's 13th birthday! I have the whole album
1	If you don't have this CD , get it now!!!  you have been missing out on some great music , This one of those albums that the more you hear it , the more you like it !!!  Los Lonely Boys are a really great live band that lays it all down and plays hard ,Looking forward to the next CD  -Granvil Poynter Texas Bluesman
1	Ever been in love with someone that didn't return your affection? This song is perfect for redeeming the broken hearted. Relax and enjoy.
1	Heart lifting song!
1	Yes
1	I purchase the first copy of this song with some other chick on it and I did not like it at all and now that he has Christette Michelle version out I had to purchase it so happy I did even though I lost $1.29 with the first version but it was worth it!
1	I bought this on the strength of one song and I'm glad I did. Wonderful music!
1	Composer is included in the file information.  This is baroque so it's going to sound well, baroque.  Of course there are going to be some you aren't 100% thrilled with, but come on...it's $5 for all of them!
1	Every song on this album is gold. They are each unique. I especially like that Kirstie and Avi get solos!
1	I just bought this CD and I am mad at myself that I waited so long! This CD is the best! I have every single one of her CDs and they are all good, but this is the best. I play it over and over. People are really sleeping on this CD. Her voice is great, you can tell that she is really putting her heart and soul into this album. Favorite songs are- Warm It Up, Piano Man, Shattered Heart, Somethings Missing, and 1st & Love. Buy this CD you will not be disappointed.
1	Look, I am an island girl who has lived in CA for a very long time, but I still get my socks off listening to great Hawn music. This song, vocals, production, etc. just takes me and my CA party to a whole happy nother level!!!
1	I just love this song! It takes me back to my teen years, listening and dancing to music in my room.
1	Lovely songs sung by the rich vocal tones of Celtic Thunder!!! Love listening to these songs!!!
1	i recently lost my job - so I play this song and sing it to remind myself that everything will be OK.
1	From 1999 - enough said!
1	Amazing, that's the first word that came to mind when I first heard Crazy Lixx's new album, New Religion. Along with Crashdiet, Reckless Love, Hardcore Superstar and Dirty Penny, these guys are bringing back the sleaze, or hair-metal if you prefer that term instead.  New Religion starts off strong with Rock And A Hard Place, it then really hits you in the face with My Medicine R.O.C.K., 21 Till I Die, Blame It On Love and Voodoo Woman. Another awesome record, that could easily boast 5-7 singles if it was ever heard on radio here in the states. These guys definitely love their rock 'n' roll, and i'm damn glad I finally discovered alot of these new Swedish bands, the only problem is, their records are pretty pricey and aren't easy to find.  I would reccommend these guys if you like Bon Jovi, Poison, Warrant, Ratt, Motley Crue and Def Leppard. They don't sound like all those bands, but they are that good, they surely deserve alot more attention than they are currently recieving.
1	Terrific album.  Even better than I expected
1	Every foreigner (not Brazilian) thinks that in Brazil only Villa-Lobos existed. Is not true. Camargo Guarnieri (1907-1993) was a genius who wrote hundreds of masterpieces. He possessed complete technical mastery, exquisite orchestration, and a knowledge of classical forms that make his symphonies and concertos much better structured than those of Villa-Lobos. For the first time, there are all 6 Guarnieri concerts on decent CD versions. Here are the first three, including the most accessible one, No. 2. Max Barros is a competent pianist and the Polish orchestra ruled by an American conductor performs a Exquisite work.
1	It's  awesome  to me that  the creator of  the universe loves me. I have to give  thanks nothing can separate us from  that  love!
1	The master of wordplay beautifully sings this slow song (a rarity) that's extremely addictive to listen to. Makes you want to play along with Jason
1	Happy I found this -great quality
1	Gracefully into the room. This song projects the very fiber of what Stevie is all about. Her voice is worthy of worship in this classic of hers. Not another soul on this earth can duplicate the experience.
1	different
1	Great shipping time! Product as described.
1	Love the music, very blues sounding.  Some of the music sounds like it came from other songs, but it's a great make you smile CD.
1	Su albm debut, Frank (editado en 2003) fue nominado a los Premios Mercury Music y gan un Ivor Novello award en 2004, por su single "Stronger than Me". En 2006, sac su segundo album, Back to Black. El 14 de febrero de 2007 gan un Brit award en la categora de Mejor Artista Britnica. Heredera de infinidad de sonidos retro, Amy Winehouse no hace sino confirmar el talento, la heterogeneidad de registros y la riqueza sonora que demostrara en su disco debut. Si con 'Frank' sorprendi a propios y extraos y se atiborr de premios y alabanzas, este 'Back To Black' no parece que vaya a cambiar la visin de esta chica. Y es que de tal mezcla inteligente de gospel, soul y jazz slo puede salir lo que sale, un disco grandioso. Si Christina Aguilera lo hace bien en "Back to Basic", Amy logro convertirse en una leyenda. S, es verdad que Winehouse no inventa nada, pero lo que reinventa lo hace mejor que bien, consiguiendo captar la atencin desde los primeros compases de 'Rehab'. 'Back To Black' adems supone un paso hacia delante en la senda de un sonido propio y caracterstico del Reino Unido, que antes tena entre sus principales estandartes a Craig David, Lilly Allen, Corinne Bailey Rae o Mys Dynamite y a la que ahora se une este nuevo talento. Con canciones directas y escritas de su puo y letra a Amy Winehouse slo le haca falta una produccin cuidada para que el resultado fuera el deseado. Y ah estaba de nuevo la chispa jazzy de Salaam Remi y el buen conocedor de los sonidos pegadizos Mark Jonson -encargado de la produccin de Lily Allen o Christina Aguilera-. Bajo su tutela productiva la nueva figura del pop britnico lleva a su terreno sonidos y cualidades vocales que mucho recuerdan a una Nina Simone y a una Aretha Franklin mezcladas -no agitadas- con Macy Gray y PJ Harvey."Yo no quera hacer ms jazz otra vez. Estaba aburrida de las estructuras de acordes complicados y necesitaba algo ms directo. He estado escuchando mucha msica de grupos de chicas de los cincuenta y los sesenta. Me gusta la simplicidad de aquella msica. Da en la diana." Se puede escuchar en la sutil referencia a las Supremes en "Back To Black".  Pero su bsqueda se extiende an ms all. Mientras que los grupos femeninos de los sesenta por los cuales se ha sentido cautivada, contenan sus voces, Amy se libera con el estilo vocal de Aretha en "Just Friends" o en "Rehab". "Love is a Losing Game" es una composicin moderna puramente clsica: breve y empapada de emocin. Otros puntos lgidos del disco incluyen la cancin inspirada en Nas, "Me and Mr Jones", la hermosa "Wake Up Alone", "I'm No Good", la epifana personal que nos habla de poder comportarnos tan mal como esos tipos que nos han causado dao y nos han dejado huella, y la cariosa cancin de estilo blues "Back To Black".
1	Great for nostalgic listeners like my husband and me. When music was understandable with romantic, melodic, lovely lyrics; talented artists.
1	This is a great song as usual for Steven Curtis Chapman, he is our favorite Christian artist, always looking forward to new songs by him! We even played one of his songs at our wedding,"I will be there."
1	Good dancing music.
1	Love that song
1	If you bought the first release when it came out, like me, you probably are wondering if this Deluxe Edition is worth it. Yes it is. I am very glad to purchase this edition, ALTHOUGH maybe next time just release the new tracks as a bonus disc by itself!
1	This is a very upbeat and positive inspirational song.
1	This is the only Kiss song that I like.
1	This is 100%, rot your teeth pop. Catchy songs with fun, electronic production. Most of these you'll have heard before, especially if you were at clubs back in the 1990s. Really big hits that are still being played today.  If you are a casual Erasure fan, the song you probably want is on this CD.  This is one of the few CDs I have had for years that still gets regular rotation. In fact, I know I've purchased it at least twice. It's very good.
1	This was a Christmas Present for my sister.  She plays it all the time in her car and at home.  Amazon was the only place that I could find this CD.  Great Gift
1	Very nice music and for the price you can't beat it. I've been listening since I got it; very Christmasy!!
1	Awesome Daddy Yankee never disappoints
1	A bit melencholy album.  Dido is not known for "happy" songs.  However she wrote this after a break-up.  So it is a bit more of a downer than usual.  Still, easy to listen to.
1	Love the song....
1	Good song easy listening especially if you are going through things. The quality is good, easy to download to cloud player and to computer and ipod.
1	I would like to say that the topics and information on these CD's, is of a 5 star nature! Good delivery, qualty and pricing helps also. Would recommend to everyone!
1	Awesome single. 
1	I really enjoy being able to find my "older" songs on digital download and these versions have the same quality as the original in a condensed and portable format.
1	One never forgets holdin' hands with RockStars! She really should use that line on her next great album...and give me a co-writer credit! I was delightfully surprised to learn of Nicole's March 23 2014 Atlanta show (Terminal West), AND that she was promoting a KICKER new album. I've been streaming it until I got my tax refund (because I'm old enough to know who her influences are when THEY were putting out new albums). This album shows a bit of a Buffalo Springfield groove, particularly on the main promo single "Girl You Look Amazing". Nicole, you ARE one AMAZING lady. Let's hang out and hold hands again soon ;)!
1	Fun song..how can you go wrong with John Prine?!!
1	I have Il Volo's Christmas CD and it's sensational.  I was so happy to see Amazon has the CDs!  I ordered this one and "We Are Love".  For anyone unfamiliar with this talented musical group should give them a try.  Their voices will knock your socks off!
1	Perfect
1	Jim Nabors is one of my favorites and I always enjoy his music.  Glad I purchased this one.  Thank you.
1	For those of you are too young to remember, this album was EVERYWHERE in the late 60s.  Mitch Ryder was tha bomb.  For real 60s sound, this album can't be beat.
1	Last year was such a Cruel Summer that I was afraid I would have the Summertime Blues.  This song has not only been a reminder that Summertime Is Great, but it has inspired me to truly make this the greatest summer ever!  Thank you Three Beat Slide.  You have ended the Summer Madness.
1	If God gives you the grace to get Back II Eden in any area this song will help you get there. Blessings.
1	This is that real music not like we have today Dr. Dre and the D.O.C was a great combo. I can only wish that this kind of real music comes back
1	This song is great.  They really need to do a whole album (or at least an EP, like Cypress Hill x Rusko).  A good fit.
1	I am a 3pointer but the flow and teaching are good. It's a blessing to see God move in and grow Christian rap the way He has. Shai stay faithful and keep it coming. Thank you for allowing God to use you.
1	Fantastic Horrified album! Great sounds and atmosphere!
1	It is very easy to download and play on computer. And the cost is very very very reasonable compare to buy a CD.
1	Great collection and value.
1	Great song
1	May it give you the courage to walk out in waters that are not familiar and your trust is only in God.
1	If this song doesn't move you then you must be a drone.....
1	Love this song but did not want the whole cd. The download from amazon required installation of their downloader which I did not like but had to to get the song.
1	This album is absolutely the crown of everything good that the 80's rock bands aspired to in terms of energy and attitude. The first six songs- Shotgun Sally, Nine Lives, Her Monkey, Whip it Out, Long Way From Home and Coast to Coast- are top notch high tempo, face-ripping hard rock, dripping raw energy and sleaze despite the ultra polished production. The album's one "eh" point is next with the customary ballad "Every Sunrise", a few steps above the typical vomit-inducing dreck of the day like Warrant's "Heaven", but still little more than breathing room before picking up again with the funkier mid-tempo "Evil Angel" and "Bad Boys are Back"(great song despite the cringeworthy title), then sprinting to the finish with high speed closer "Heaven on a Heartbeat". Is it deep? Of course not, it's 1989. But if you want to push the envelope beyond Poison and Warrant and the like, without going full-on metal, take a listen to this band....and don't blame me for the speeding ticket.
1	Up thru IH's third solo album, the transcendant "Overnight Angels," every facet of IH's career is represented here.  Far FAR better than any subsequent "best ofs."  Shame it was only releasesd on LP.
1	I love this album. This is the 2nd time I've bought it, actually. It's full of fun dance music that makes you get up and want to move. Not just for goths, but for anyone that likes to dance.
1	Good song with great beat.
1	Love it!
1	Music its a little bit scary lol but its very effective !!! I had lucid dreams with this and its cool at the same time it's programing your subconscious too (with affirmations)
1	Steve is a great singer!  First heard him as the lead singer for Journey a few years back.  Smooth voice, and not bad to look at either!  Highly recommend anything by Steve Augeri
1	Alternative at its finest
1	This is my first Uncle Lucius recording and I like him a lot. His "Keeping the Wolves Away" is great.
1	No problem, no delays.
1	fresh and unique this deftones single was very good. Chino has a unique voice you can't find anywhere else. Very good.
1	Just recently discovered Jack White (via DVD -- It Might Get Loud) and I'm hooked.
1	Several people have compared this work to Crystal Planet. This certainly is Joe's best work since CP without a doubt. I think a lot of people must have told him to get back to those days. However having said that, this collection is not CP. There's several tracks that could have fit perfectly on CP (Cataclysmic is this album's "With Jupiter in MInd" and "On Peregrine Wings" is it's "Celebration"). There's some newness that brings back memories of CP. There's that space feel, some offbeat type stuff (though nothing quite comes close to "Time"). There are a couple of filler tunes of course, but overall, this is a must have for Joe fans. Yes I too have felt deflated after most of what he has released since Engines of Creation and Strange Beautiful Music, the last album was also touted as a return to the past, but aside from about 4 tracks it let me down...but now he's back in true form, and I'm back, and you'll be back too! Five stars for this one Joe.... can't wait to hear the followup to it. Don't disappoint!  :)
1	Good song fast download
1	I was looking for this music and finally found it, than, you so much.
1	Beautiful, timeless song.  Very sweet and simple.
1	Great CD, it just started skipping halfway through.
1	Very nice song with charming lyrics.  Sounds better in a live version.
1	I had a dream about five or six years ago that Bob Dylan had released a Christmas CD. No joke. Now it seems that the dream has come true. I can not believe the type of reviews that I've seen for this thing. Critisizing just about everything... from his voice, to his disloyalty to his Jewish heritage.  Hey... go back about thirty years and maybe your critisms will be relavant...  If you've been paying any attention to to the Didge these last fifteen years, you will notice that he has been on a kick trying to span a wide spectrum of Americana and roots like material. This is just another entry into that style. Surely if 1960's  Bob Dylan tried to do a Christmas album it would be quite strange (in my dream it was like "heeeeeee-eeeere coooommmes saaaaantahhhh!--") but considering the stuff he's done of late, this is right up his street.  It's fun... it's a bit comical, but if you put it on during the holidays, and don't tell anybody what it is... they'll either dig it, or won't know the difference from any other disc you put on. It's Dylans style of the last decade+ that I dig.  If you are still looking to him to be the voice of a sub culture, sorry, you missed the boat. I personally am holding out for the vinyl edition, available at the end of November, I can already tell it's gonna be rich, and I can't wait to play it for the fam over some heavilly boozed up nog and cider! Happy birthday JESUS!!!!
1	Got this for my daycare
1	"Diablero, A Rock Opera" is a must see for enthusiasts of the work of Carlos Castaneda. With superb musicianship and imaginative composition, the CD at once takes the listener into the magical world described by Castaneda in his early books. A feature film of "Diablero" should be produced. The historical importance and cultural significance of this work can not be overstated.
1	one of my favorites
1	It was a little difficult to listen to this uncharacteristically electro album from Sufjan Stevens, but now it's my favorite.  I saw the concert as well; there's an interesting story behind this album and the artwork.  I recommend you give it a chance.
1	One of the greatest songs from one of the most amazing vocal talents of our time and any time.....his voice is so beautiful, so moving.
1	I am so happy to have this song,I also have the CD. It brings back so many memories,of my brother and I singing these songs together,from the fields in Indiana,singing for Grandma on the farm,at the Pig Roast,to the beautiful fields of Kansas. or sitting with a group of friends,just singing. We loved these songs and they still are sung today. Amazon, you have all kinds of music, and this is one of my favorites..."Thanks for the Memories....SING!
1	I don't listen to much Pink music.  Saw her on Oprah.  Liked the song, put it on my wish list, then found the clean version.  Figured I'd like it better.  That's all there is to it.
1	Great band from out of Eastern Michigan University circa 1993.  Good electronic tunes like depeche mode and INXS.  I really liked it then and I really like it now.  Doesn't sound dated thank god!  I remember living in goddard when these guys were working on it and getting the cassette free from the dude with the curly hair. It was nice to find it on CD 17 years later.
1	First and foremost, NO ALBUM WILL EVER TOP "AUGUST".  If you are looking for the Crows to ever top that, IMO your expectations are too high.  "August" is untouchable.  Second, IMHO this is the Crows best work since "Recovering the Satellites".  IMHO, every album since "Satellites" has had a few gems, but also a bunch of B-side songs that are kinda fillers.  By no means am I slamming them, because I am a HUGE FAN of the Crows, but IMO they haven't had "that complete album" since "Satellites"  Third, Go Youtube "Scarecrow" and then "Palisades Park".  ^ Both are great videos, and will give you a new appreciation for those songs.  Each video tells a story, and both videos are connected together.  (Kinda like what Greenday did a few years back with "Holiday" & BOBD")  Anywhoo.. I honestly enjoyed every song on this album.  Even "Elvis Goes to Hollywood", IMO is good.  There's a hook to that song that keeps bringing me back.  "Possibility Days" is some of Adam's best work ever.  Finally, if I had to pick a personal favorite it would be a coin-toss between "God of Ocean Tides" and "Possibility Days".  Just an overall solid album.  Thank you Adam.  Thank you Crows... :)
1	Anthem Lights have done an excellent job of 'mashing up' some of the best Christian songs of today. Recommended to all who love singing about the Lord and all He's done for us!
1	Hot song ever. It's like someone loving you and making your body so warm.
1	Great music to listen to.  The download is wonderful and the music is with much clarity. This is a must download song :)
1	i enjoy chris tomlins music i have other songs he sings. we sing this in church and it is one of my favorite songs i would recomend it to all.
1	These guys are amazing. If you like any of switchfoots songs this is for you.
1	Great worship song
1	Beautiful, you will never see them again but with this CD we have memories.
1	With just one moderately charting hit back in 1987, Norwood (born Norwood Young, 1964, in Trenton, New Jersey), pretty much went under before most people really even knew who he was. A shame too, because he's a great singer. Whether he's crooning on the shimmery ballad "Should Have Been Us Together," or being energetic on the funky "Lady In Love," Norwood's strong, gritty voice, which is somewhat reminiscent of John White (another obscure 80s soul balladier who should have been much bigger than he was), injects this set of slick, well-produced set of poppy soul with an energy and passion that only so many male soul balladiers of the mid/late 80s could muster. He resurfaced with an all new album in 2008, which I can't comment on since I haven't heard it, but since he's still only in his 40s, I imagine that he's probably retained a good amount of what he had back in '87.
1	awesome recommend getting this song. I really like it, I first head it on the FISH, 95.9 fm. :) I think....
1	Great!
1	I love all of Peter,Paul and Mary's music and songs. They inspired me all the time as God inspired me to sing too!
1	We like it.
1	Love the song...upbeat, heartfelt and annointed.  It's awesome!

1	Brillantes artistas que concursaron en Eurovision de 2006, un gran album, y en un pop agradable
1	Justin Timberlake has gone from almost a joke pop star to a serious and comedic actor, with some of SNL's most classic bits starring him.  This song shows a maturity he has finally hit that I think fans always thought him capable of. It is catchy and pop yet has a sexy undertone, much like he has turned out to be himself. I fell in love with this song the first time I heard it and was shocked when I found out who sang it. Bravo Justin, another good career move.
1	This cd is wounderful. It has all types of songs on it all speaking the same message about love.  Its a great cd, it really impowers his voice,  you can just feel his soul in it.  The background with his brothers make it beautiful and harmonious.  This is a must have for any osmond fan and espesally a JIMMY fan :) enjoy
1	Just love it! My daughter loves pistol annies and I do too, great music a a great album. Thank you
1	TIP is baaaaack!  His wordplay is amazing, he paints pictures with his words. Love it!!
1	Pure brilliance. The Mavericks have given us a real treat! These tunes kick and there are some beautiful ballads and love songs. ZERO buyers remorse~it'll become your favorite!
1	The heavily-promoted and massive Time-Life "mail order only" series of CDs of about 15 - 20 years ago constantly reminded you that "you can't get these in any store" and seemed intent, at the time, to corner the market on everything from the Big Band Era to Pop, Country, R&B, Soul and R&R Oldies. In addition to single artist releases, they put out year by year volumes covering the best hits of 1940 to (as far as I can tell) 1969, interspersed with theme releases such as The Unforgetable `50s, The Late `50s and R&B Gems II, among many many more.  Since there was little real competition in terms of sound quality and program notes at the time, I suppose quite a few bought into the hype, although it was an expensive venture since they also charged quite a bit more for each disc than the normal going rate. Now here we are with options like Ace Of London, Eric Records, Jasmine, Bear Family, Collectables, Collector's Choice, Rhino, Varese-Sarabande, Razor & Tie, etc., and suddenly these Time-Life releases are popping up for sale all over the place, and mostly at prices considerably less than when they were first issued.  Rest assured that if the song you are seeking is among the 22 contained contained in this volume that it is the original rendition, and that the sound quality is impeccable. In addition, you get an insert containing four pages of background notes written by Washington music critic Joe Sasfy, and a complete chart detail/label information discography. In this volume you also get nice photos of The Velvelettes, Skeeter Davis, Bob & Earl, and Chuck Jackson.  The contents are: 1. It Will Stand - The Showmen; 2. Needle In A Haystack - The Velvelettes; 3. I Don't Want To Cry - Chuck Jackson; 4. Stairway To Heaven - Neil Sedaka; 5. Johnny Get Angry - Joanie Sommers; 6. Every Breath I Take - Gene Pitney; 7. Something's Got A Hold On Me - Etta James; 8. Pain In My Heart - Otis Redding; 9. The Nitty Gritty - Shirley Ellis; 10. Mission Bell - Donnie Brooks; 11. Till - The Angels; 12. Road Runner - Bo Diddley; 13. Harlem Shuffle - Bob & Earl; 14. It Might As Well Rain Until September - Carole King; 15. Sweets For My Sweet - The Drifters; 16, Rinky Dink - Dave "Baby" Cortez; 17. I Can't Stay Mad At You - Skeeter Davis; 18. Twist, Twist Senora - Bobby "U.S." Bonds; 19. Drag City - Jan & Dean; 20. Cradle Of Love - Johnny Preston; Bobby's Girl - Marcie Blane; 22. Tragedy - The Fleetwoods.
1	One of best voices today.
1	love it... best thing I've spent money on l-/
1	Katy Perry brings the fierceness once again! This song makes me want to wake up in the morning, throw my head back, and say "Here I come, world!"
1	I love it I love it
1	Great Tune Timeless
1	Another solid song from the new Skillet album that showcases their softer side. While this is not nearly the side if Skillet I often listen to, it is good enough in its own right.  Rating: 4
1	And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*.
1	It sounds nice. I like the rhyme and lyric. For the money it sells it's a perfect piece of music.
1	The words are very real for those people that look deep within the soul. It is for those that contemplate beyond there walk in life.  It is timeless.
1	I watched  a video parody of this song complaining about the governments over regulated water rights. Well we also watched the movie Frozen. Therefore, I down loaded the song Let It go, by Demi Lovato. F.Y.I. when I down loaded this song at first I could not find it in MS Media Player list.  I did eventually find it under Frozen.
1	This import CD has a semi-bootleg quality about it, but don't be concerned about the sound - it's fine for what is being comped.  The compilation mainly focuses on 1950s r&b vocal groups and their songs about the comic book heroes of the era - fun stuff to be sure.  All are fairly obscure and rare, beyond "The Ballad Of Davey Crockett".  I believe Johnny Cash is on this thing under a pseudonym as well.  In any event, the collection rocks, and the lyrics will bring a smile if you pay attention to them.
1	Love the new album!
1	A classic.
1	as expected
1	But, it is still a nice collection.  It was a steal at $1.99, but it would still be a bargain for more than that.
1	I love the 1975. Their sound is what i consider to be contemporary 80's pop. However, the vinyl i ordered did have little black lines on it, but i like it because it makes it look imperfect. The vinyl is also ever so slightly warped due to the warm weather. Also, with shipping, this came out to 45 dollars, which i think is a little overpriced. Maybe like 10 or 15 bucks less and the price would have been good.
1	wonderful
1	Great rocking POP at it's best! Really catchy and melodic! "Yo Pussycat" shoulda been a hit! We want to hear more Chris!!!
1	My 14 months old baby loves this song. Quality is great. I wanted exactly same sinsong, singed by same singer etc...and I think this is it!
1	This is such an amazing album. This is the true original album, with the correct ending to "More Than Wonderful," unlike what I got on itunes, and no gaps or spaces in the pieces, as happened on the itunes album because of digitization. It's perfect. It's what I remember, what I want, and what I have on an old cassette. This remains one of my absolute favorites of Sandi Patti.
1	I've followed Lucinda Williams since the 90's and love this album. It's great to find music that grows on you the way her music does. Every time I hear it I like it more and more. Well worth it!
1	Getting to like Sting, more and more
1	Great
1	How do you make a review for a song?  8 hours...for what...?  loose your blues, everybody cut FOOTLOOSE.  Great song.  Check out the Innocence Live for their version of the song.
1	I play this music when I'm trying to get some good sleep, or when I am trying to focus on something.  It is well produced and coherent.
1	Love the song and his rendition particularly!! The beat is great and he is a good singer. It's a real toe tapper.
1	This is phenomenal, sublime music, especially on a set of high-end headphones.  These are fierce lyrics that cry out "the political IS the personal", and sometimes they do so in ways that are intensely challenging to have to acknowledge and take in. It helps greatly that Anohni's unique, head-turning vocals are every bit as beautiful and powerful as in her prior work.  The music itself is sonically inventive pop-electronica, melodic, soaring, sometimes there's a strong thumping beat, sometimes it's more expansive and almost ocean-like.  The most anthemic song of these, and the one that really moves me, is "Why Did You Separate Me From The Earth?"  I'm writing this review after two listens, and there were more than two surprise moments when tears formed in my eyes. It's rare when a few first listens make me want ten more.  This is gorgeous stuff, one of 2016's best albums so far, and Anohni rewards the listener who's willing to turn it up, listen intimately, and really 'go there' with her.
1	Very uplifting album. Perfect for easy Sunday listening. Would recommend.
1	very satisfied with my purchase.
1	I lost this song from my mp3 album. I noticed it was missing and this was not acceptable to me. This was my first downloaded song from Amazon a few years ago.
1	Came extremely fast. A little pricey for a cd that has been out for a while. But it worth it since it's hard to find.
1	It brings back memories of my youth!
1	Classic Bruce
1	Amazing remake!
1	This is the best!  I have taken classes from Ms. Harbison at a harp conference before, and there is a reason she is famous :)
1	One of the most original sounding artists I've heard in a long time. His vocal style is so unique, when you hear a Midnight Kahuna song, the voice is always unmistakeably - Lika! Great songs, production, vocals and entertaining too!! The only thing better than the music itself, might be the quality videos that the band produces. This is a top Miami band with a World Sound. I've been a fan since the first time I heard them. Enjoy !!
1	Another favorite oldie.
1	Great CD. Love these guys! Bought the CD for my hubby as we are going to see FL GA Line in concert in March with Jason Aldean. Bonus points BC I got the digital download ;)
1	as advertised.
1	Awesome cd love pixies!
1	So much yes. This song is addicting, I want to loop it forever. Has just the right amount of cheeriness and a catchy melody.
1	I didn't want to write anything before I gave the album enough listens. I was certainly hyped and very much excited ever since the very moment I ordered the album from Chevelle's official merch site. Then I got to download a digital version of the album on the release date, BUT since my copy had included the bonus song "Miracle", I only gave it a couple of spins (wasn't disappointed at all), and waited to give this more proper listens until I got my copy with the bonus track.  As has been said on almost every other review, this is definitely their heaviest album. Is this a bad thing? Well, it depends... I only have a few complaints which are the following: As far as heaviness goes, I prefer this side of Chevelle. I think their heavier side was perfectly balanced with melody on Vena Sera, and specially on TTOT and my favorite of theirs Wonder What's Next. The problem this album has it that it does lack some melody. Some of these songs could really use that melodic punch on the choruses, as their older songs used to have.  Following those lines, there are two specific songs which I have some issues with. Enemies is one of them. Some of the screams here sound a bit forced, and I simply don't know why they thought adding screaming samples here and there would make the song sound heavier. On top of it, the drums, for some reason, are mixed incredibly loud here. While the album is pretty much headphone-ready overall (it really adds to it), every time this track comes up I must lower the volume a bit because other then the actual sound of the drums itself, I feel as if the treble is a bit higher here than any other of the songs. The chorus while it sounds fitting right at the end of the song (where the drum/guitar pattern changes a bit), it sounds a bit tedious for me for the most part. All in all, feels like it was trying to recapture past glories like Brainiac, but instead it comes with mixed results.  Second track I have problems with is Last Days. I personally love the bass riff at the beginning, and the bridge alone really saves this song for me because it sounds so great. But again, the lyrics are very repetitive (tedious) and the screams sound very forced. Other than the delivery, and the forced screams I feel Pete wasn't sure on what direction to go with the lyrics, because these have to be my least favorite lyrics from the bad to this date. This song could have used more melody, and different lyrics to really be great.  Other than those two songs, and probably Warhol's Showbiz which is the only "good/decent" moment here, I'm very much satisfied with the rest. Young Wicked is one of my favorites, and it captures Chevelle being heavy and doing it right. Rivers is probably my second favorite, incorporating a melodic-heavy dynamic not very much unlike Pantera's This Love. One of the standout moments for sure. Mind you, these two songs have very repetitive lyrics, and a lot of aggression in them but they work. Third favorite songs would probably be a tie between Door To Door Cannibals, which definitely grants the comparisons to Tool, and Shot From A Cannon, which could easily be anywhere on Wonder What's Next and has a very headbanging intro and chorus. Not to say the rest isn't great, Joyride is classic Chevelle, Got Burned should probably be the next single as it is one of the most energetic moments of the album (percussion is great here), and Punchline is essentially the next Twinge; I think Chevelle can pull off that ominous experimental side very well and I hope they continue with that trend.  A Miracle, which is the exclusive song I was talking about should have been on the standard version of the album. This makes up a lot of the melody that was lacking in the earlier songs, and it is by far one of my absolute favorite Chevelle songs. It harkens back to some of the earlier melodic pieces of the band, and makes it an essential listen.  The bass production here is top notch, and the songs have a much fuller sound than how the production was handled in La Gargola and HOTTB, which felt a bit thin and lacking. This album has wear off a bit, I admit, but I still enjoy it and I have listened to it numerous times. La Gargola, and Sci-Fi Crimes were definitely growers, while this has much more of an instant impact. While it may not change your mind about the band, they have proven themselves veterans, and they can rock without losing or overplaying their accessibility. I definitely applaud their integrity as a band.  4 solid stars from me.
1	Love, Love, Love this album!
1	People age, it's a fact of life. Instead of trying to maintain a certain sound, Stevie Nicks is who she is, a nearly seventy year old woman with a lot of tough miles behind her. Maybe she can't hit the high notes she used to, but what can you do the same way you did forty years ago? Stevie Nicks can weave a story like few others and Dave Stewart makes it sound magical. I took a star off for a couple of things that sound repetitive (another version of Twisted; If You Were my Love and Blue Water sound eerily like Sleeping Angel). The Dealer, Belle Fleur, and Starshine have a great vintage sound and the organs sound cool. All the Beautiful Worlds and Carousel highly feature Stevie's background singers. I Don't care and Watch Chain sound like they could play on country radio right now.
1	GREAT fun song!  Very happy for Robin - he has worked many years has had some success but this is the one Gigantic hit you've been waiting for.  Keep up the Great work!!!!

1	This song sounds great on my computer, television (via Roku), cell phone and Kindle. This was definitely a great find! I am so glad that I purchased it!
1	Awesome!!!!!!

1	Love it!  Might be their best album yet.
1	The Poets "Scotland's No. 1 Group" ------------------------------------- A fascinating collection of rare singles and unreleased tracks by one of Scotland's best rock bands of the late 1960s, with a stylistic range similar to that of the English band Pretty Things, ranging from Yardbirds-y R&B to more psychedelic and edgier material. A fascinating glimpse at one of the Northern British rock/garage scene's great lost bands.  Recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)
1	"Flood" by Jars of Clay is a great song about staying strong during adversity. The singer expresses a  humble person who truly wants to be lifted up and move to an even happier place in life. "Flood" by Jars of Clay is good for those who like emotionally nourishing rock songs.
1	The only reference I had about this artist was the fact he was teacher of Alfred Brendel. But when I decided to purchase this record (in the late nineties) my surprise was majuscule. Why is this notable pianist so underrated? I asked to myself during my last listening yesterday evening.  His Beethoven is extremely restrained, very thoughtful and played keeping into account the sense of color and a sense of organical flow. his Brahms Intermezzi were recorded with a touch of majestic radiance; Baumgartner leaves aside the romantic element and focuses around the melodic line until the very core.  His Debussy was a great discover. Nuance, grace and tune depicted with an admirable nocturnal poetry. Images and Masques find him in total domain of the Impresionistic repertoire  And here we come: I found Chopin's Ballade No. 4 and kept my expectations with certain prudence. the result was simply admirable. I think this is -if not the best- one of the most pyramidal readings of this Op. Introspection and expressiveness paves the way to the admirable fortissimos in the last two minutes. Baumgartner gives us no wrong note; his laser performance reveals us a deep knowledge of the work. And Chopin sounds with majestic classicism, far from the Romantic approach given by most of pianists.  My gentle reader: Go for this one as soon as you can. Under the circumstances you were not able to get it, you should find this recording in an old music store in Europe or USA, do yourself a favour and go for it.  A notable and priceless recital. the quality sound 8Keeping in mind we are in 1964) is extremely good.  Totally recommended.  .
1	I remember the 60's, Junior High, High school and the Viet Nam war.  Folk music as it was called moved to the forefront on the music charts.  It was, if you will, the alternative to the horrors we heard and read about every day and watched on TV every night.  Peter, Paul and Mary put out some of the best music in this genre.  While Trini Lopez also sang "If I Had A Hammer", my preference hands down is Peter, Paul and Mary's version.  Mary's earthy voice collaborated beautifully with Peter and Paul's harmonies.  Each brought out the best in the other and a truly great song was born.  This song along with "Where Have All The Flowers Gone" are must haves for any folk music collection.
1	Ed Sheeran is beyond AMAZING!
1	There is no reason to be saying anything negative about a tribute to a man of the caliber of JOHN WINSTON LENNON, this old world has never recovered from his loss!  I never have & don't expect to for the rest of my days, a very clever mind, song composer, singer/player & promoter of PEACE & LOVE!  I love you, John with all my heart.  The remaster is worthy of the efforts that went in to update the sound, it is an excellent version of George's composition to fellow Beatle John Lennon!  RIP, John & George!
1	I loved each and every song on the album! His lyrics are so relatable, and his voice is truly incredible!
1	Quick and easy download; great products!
1	I like the artist and another great song. Heard it on the radio so knew what to expect. Enough said.
1	Cool Song
1	Old Skool
1	carlos brought the world of the latino into hard rock much the same the chambers bros brought the black man's music into this genre,  jimi the axe genius notwithstanding. he had help. mike shrieve has ever been a percussionist from another planet.. but Santana was launched with evil ways and  abraxas. Rock was now showing a very healthy eclecticism.
1	thanks
1	Gaga excels again.
1	This is one of the finest works by Sutherland Brothers & Quiver and is well worth adding to your collection. This bands collection of music is  almost complete on CD all we need now is Down To Earth, When The Night  Comes Down and of course there  very best work the american release version  of Lifeboat.
1	Love having this song!
1	Used multiple times now at funerals.  great song.
1	The title song cover of the night is my favorite song of all time! Lots of other hits on this album. If you are a good rats fan u must have this cd in your collection! Great music! Better than five stars.
1	Although a very sad song...it shows the great love that two people have for each other and that they can't live without one another.
1	This album won a Grammy many years ago.  I saw a Gospel Choir perform the Halleluah Chorus live at the award show.  Since then I have not only enjoyed the recording tremendously myself I have given it to several people at Christmas time and they have been equally enthralled.  I loaned it to my son's High School Choir teacher and finaaly made it a gift when he refused to give it back!
1	my nieces love this ! play it over and over for the 11 yr old ! =) she added to her own playlist now too !
1	Emmy always an enjoyable listen. She does fine harmony and is nice contrast to Rodney . song selection ok ...
1	love it
1	cool!
1	I immediately recognized Marvin Gaye's Got to Give Up and the umistakable Michael Jackson "WHOOO!!" sample. I don't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig, but, i like this!
1	A must have on everyone's playlist.  I dare you to stand still while listening to it.
1	Gorgeous voice that truly radiates the spirit of the piece.  This is absolutely my favorite rendition of this song - a must have!
1	Great
1	Sounds great on my computer and on my mp3 player, the only issue I have is the fiddle faddle I have to go through to download it, it should be simple, it use to be, but not now.
1	good stuff
1	Came just as expected and right on time
1	Superb!
1	The pieces are absolutely beautiful, but the poor recordings make it difficult to enjoy them. Perhaps if they were remastered it would improve things - in the end, listen to the samples, the poor recording might matter less to you than it does to me.
1	unexpected emotion, edgey.
1	good new group
1	Awesome album, I can sing along to all the music!
1	Great CD. Great condition.
1	My favorite version of this classic
1	The Pretty Reckless Light Me Up is a very good rock CD with 11 songs and full of emotions that everyone can relate to.  The singer's voice is also very good and on most songs you will feel like humming along or singing along in your car or at home.  Track one expresses the effects of drugs on the singer's life, track two another good rock song with decent lyrics but personally prefer the live version found on the CD single "Hit Me Like A Man."  Track 3 is a song you can't help but sing along to and relate to the lyrics at some point in your life "I'll Never Be Good Enough", track 4 is a song with strange lyrics but the singer is right about one main thing no matter how much we desire to change "Can't Be Anything Else But Me."  Track 5 is another song you can hum along to and enjoy moving to the music but in the end she will get her revenge on those who hurt her, track 6 shows how much you want to numb out the pain, hurt, so you take anything to drown it out but for "Just Tonight."  Track 7 shows how fast fame, fortune comes to your life, and then in blink of an eye it's turns you into "Miss Nothing, track 8 is a song about the singer looking for her hero to save her from 'Going Down."  Track 9 is another song about trying to fill the void in your life but this time trying to find it in love, religion, or even fame in the form of "Rock and Roll", track 10 threw the pain and sorrow you need that special someone to help you get threw it and keep you going.  Last track 11 is a feel good song about enjoy life and having fun by trying to get into the parties and you can move to the music bob your head or body threw the song start to end.
1	Yes, the sole reason I came to find this album is the same way most others found it,  twenty-five years after it's release: the fact that Trent Reznor played keyboards for the album. Definitely a different sound from his early Nine Inch Nails efforts, of course, being a pure 80's rock band, complete with great solos and synth tracks, the latter being provided by none other than Trent. If you can stand taking it down a notch from Nine Inch Nails, this is an incredibly underrated album for it's sound, and every track is my favorite. These guys are definitely talented, and this album should be heard.
1	Whether used for relaxation, meditation, practicing you or other exercise, I highly recommend Windham Hill for easy going background music.
1	Looks like it was initially issued as two separate CDs, Vol 1 & 2. Only drawback was the mastering of the sound quality, but excellent collection of fine instrumentals!
1	I love this song.  I love Passenger.  I saw him in Columbus, OH last summer and have been in love ever since.
1	I'm not exactly a cher fan but this is just one of my favorite songs...

1	This is an old one, that my dad used to play on the 'Hi-Fi' turntable when I was growing up.  I remember going to see the film, as a family.
1	Well at least like this. I listen to it all. If it's good it's for me. Mumford and Sons truly now how to capture the art of songwriting and keep a folk but current vibe. This band and album are a great listen!
1	Great cd
1	I would have given it 4 stars but someone who actually likes the song only left 1 star. This song and Nice, Nice Very Nice are '70s aor classics. Their biggest hit however is cheezy and poppy It's Maaagic... you knoww blah blah blah...drivel
1	I  do like this song very much it's now one of my favorites. I suggest this song if you like NIN and  .
1	FIRE

1	Great song good price
1	Very pretty song! Don't let anyone put you in their jar of hearts!
1	The John Wilkes Kissing Booth broke up in the early aughts, and released only one CD, "Goodnight Machines," the legacy of the band lives on with the band's lead singer, Derrick Brown. Brown was already a well-known performance poet when the band formed, and ultimately chose to pursue poetry as his main focus. This lead to the creation of Write Bloody Publishing, his acclaimed and extremely popular publishing for spoken word. And fans of his poetry -- perhaps especially his live performances -- will find a lot of like on this CD. As the main lyricist, Brown's poetics are all over this city, as is his effective use of his falsetto. It has a wonderful quality of making one feel grounded and amped -- sort of an energizing thoughtfulness. It's the type of CD which begs to be attached to a time period of your life, so that when you hear a song you go, "Oh my gosh -- that road trip!" or "That winter I didn't have heat!" or "That bastard who broke my heart!" not that I associate the CD with any or all of those examples. If you are fan of Derrick Brown, I would highly suggest buying this CD to complete your collection. You won't be disappointed.
1	I love this song along with Maxi Priest's "How Can We Ease the Pain."  Brings back good memories of a time long ago for me!
1	This is an unforgettable classic by one of the masters. It will blow your mind and set you free into flight
1	No matter how far down you've fallen in life, this song brings hope to those who have given up. Jason, your song is a message of love and renewal in a troubled world.
1	goodnight....
1	great song
1	Reba never has a bad song.  Love her voice and the way she makes me part of her feelings.
1	This has been my favorite CD for the last 6 months. Love his Scottish soulful voice. I have played it over and over again. The arrangement on the CD gives you both slow melancholy tunes or full on get groovin' tunes to move and dance to. I purchased it after it had been out for a couple of years, but love his music and his voice is to swoon over. Yummy!
1	This one of his best songs a it will always be around . If you fall in love while this song is playing you will remember this song forever. I love it always have and I listen to it often to remind me how sweet love is.
1	This is A excellent career spanning two cd set.
1	this is my favorite song!! I play it again,  play it again, play it again and again...lol. love it so much
1	I really like this song it is so up lefting and supportive I praise God for people who are doing what God called them to do go Mandisa continue to help everyone with their walk with our Lord.
1	I absolutely love this song. It is beautiful and melodic with easy to memorize lyrics. I enjoy the video as well as it comes off kind of hippy-ish cool.
1	Great song.
1	Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!
1	I always love when a new Panic! album or song comes out! It never sounds exactly the same as before, but it's always beautiful and catchy. This single is no different; I love it!
1	wonderful
1	nice
1	Love this song !!! Great download
1	Great songs!  I have listened to Celtic Thunder for many years, but am just now becoming interested in the solo works. I think that any Celtic Thunder, Irish Music or even Country music fan would enjoy this!
1	If I did not like this, I would not have bought it.
1	Hmmm...Im a little on the fence about this album. It's not bad at all and in fact it is quite good bit I preordered this album which gave me access to the first 4 songs early and I had the chance to listen to them quite a lot and the first 4 songs on this album are very strong and in fact "know it all" and "upper hand" are still 2 of my favorites on the album even after thoroughly listening to all them. But I have to admit, it definitely loses a little steam after "lay my claim". I'm not sure if it's just the choice of the song layout or what but I started feeling bored but then it picks up again. Im not saying it's a bad album, it's still very good work and I'm a huge fan of rebelution and will continue to support them but I feel this album as a whole seemed a little rushed and maybe a tad over produced. There's a couple songs that I wouldn't have even known there were more members of the band had I not known already due to the lack of actual instruments. Eric rachmany is a phenomenal guitarist and totally under rated in my opinion and previous rebelution albums always shine a lot of light on his skills as a guitarist but I didn't see much of that on this album. I know my review seems mixed...lots of pros and cons, but truthfully it's still a solid album and if you are a true rebelution fan you won't be disappointed if you pick up this album, still has a bunch of great songs on it, I guess I was just expecting more knowing what this band is capable of. "Upper hand" is still one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard.
1	great song
1	This song touches my heart everything I hear it! It touches me in such a way that I was led to minister the song through a dance
1	This was the most exciting album I heard in 2010. In 2011 it won the Grammy for Best Album of the Year. As with their other albums Neon Bible and Funeral, The Suburbs is thematic and a collective experience. The songs belong together like pieces of a puzzle and their arrangement is a story with a beginning and an end. Actually you could even say some songs are paired up like two different characters in the same scene but from unique perspectives. For example, in Sprawl I (Flatlands), Win seems to express a moment in time from a very somber point of view, while Regine sings Sprawl II (Mountains beyond Mountains) with ethereal lightness -- though deceptively so, because the lyrics are still on one level about running into cops on the street and on another, about existential crisis. This band is awesome, this album raised the bar for musical releases that had degenerated into disjointed MP3 singles, and the members of this group are very committed to good causes -- consistently raising money and awareness for those suffering in Haiti still from a terrible earthquake that happened only a few years back. I still listen to this album two years later and love it as much as the first time.
1	This song for our first dance at our wedding
1	Love
1	We love long handled teaspoons.  Use them for everything from stirring coffee to iced tea to eating.  Good quality for the price.  Highly recommend them.
1	I am a Mavericks fan from the nineties and couldn't believe it when they got back together.  Their new CD is excellent. I liked them a lot before and now even more. Raul sounds as good as he ever has. I love the two versions of Come Unto Me. Back In Your Arms Again sticks in my head over and over, but I love it and could listen to it a thousand more times. If you liked the Mavericks in the 90's, get this CD.
1	Chris draws on a huge number of musical influences to create something unique but with clarity and skill.  I would completely recommend investment of your time
1	Talent and chutzpah! So glad we found this fearless vocal powerhouse defiantly walking the red carpet at the Grammy Awards. Waiting for the next release.
1	I started listening to this band when they released Son of the Morning. And have to say Children of Fire is really great love the lyrics. And glad I bought it. If you are a Oh, Sleeper fan you should get this album.
1	Yes, thank-you for asking. It is a very good CD for meditation, I recomended to who ever wants to take a few minutes and lisent to a very good guidance meditation. Thaks JP
1	I can listen to this song over and over. Never knew the singer before but he has a wonderful easy listening voice and the song is beautiful.  I have looked up his other music after listening to this song. Lifts me up every time I listen to it. I don't like loud, fast, music and appreciate being able to understand the words as he sings. Nice balance of vocals and instruments.
1	Joss Stone has a fabulous voice and I love the soul sound of some of her music. All her songs are good to out of this world.
1	We just got this for Christmas and it's a wonderful CD! My four year old is asking great questions about the songs.
1	If you are a CHRISTIAN, whether Protestant or Catholic, you have heard all these wonderful hymns. They are beautifully done by an excellent choir.
1	Beautiful song that still echoes in memory even as I write this review. Never has Celine sounded better. Josh's voice is truly a gift. Wonderful.
1	Not too much to say, except this quickly became my new favorite. If you like country you, will love this album
1	Really like this song. Warren was a great artist with many unique songs. This is one I just recently encountered and am glad I did. Thanks Warren
1	Just downloading some songs from the 80s/90s that I've forgotten about till I heard them on satellite radio! Tesla is a very under-rated 80s bad, IMO.
1	I love this CD! I have it in my car and hear it all the time. It never gets old and is always inspiring. It's too bad that she died too early because she might have blessed the world with more wonderful music.
1	Great song...
1	I'll flat out say it - a much better album than the recent Tony Bennett/Lady Gaga offering (and her version of "Cheek to Cheek" has a much more original arrangement).  Great mix of tunes, wonderful arrangements and killer voice.  She even makes "Defying Gravity" fresh again with a stripped down introspective version that makes me actually want to listen to it again (if she tackles "Let It Go" though...all bets are off!)
1	Not bad, not all of his best works though
1	I hardly post reviews, much less have the time. But, I thought this album deserved a good review worth my time and a bit of positive rattle from me to encourage others about their band. I have found Gwen Stacy to sound like other bands, but they also play themselves on the front of their music. Band sounds that they spill into are that of Beloved, Evergreen Terrace, The Devil Wears Prada, August Burns Red, and Norma Jean. The most unique song that gives the album a turn toward it's end is #9- Sleeping in the Train Yard, which starts out with a 3 minute intro. All of the other songs are good, have good breakdowns, don't sound like other songs on the album (in my opinion), and it didn't take me "getting used to it" or "letting it grow on me" before I liked the entire album.  I agree with the last reviewers choice of songs.  They're ALL really good though.  This album has been spun in my car and room many times, for it is not an album full of monotonous songs that sound like each other. That's another reason I was attracted to this band at 1st. Also, they're a Christian band on a secular label (Ferret Style), similar to Stryper on Hollywood Records. They were also outspoken about how the album's lyrics were about faith. This is a solid album. They're also on tour with Inhale Exhale of Solid State Records at the moment.
1	Best, best of... ever!
1	Great blues tune. One of my favs!
1	This is my first DCB purchase; and I have to say, wow! This album is one of the most dopest LPs I have ever heard. I mean their mixing is superb, simply outstanding and refreshing! I love the transition from 1st track to the end, and the finale track to the 1st track again. (AS IF THEY KNEW YOU WOULD LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING FRONT TO BACK!) And I did! Every song gives you an anticipation of the next. The album is packed full of worship. I am very meticulous about what I allow in me Eye, ear gate. Their words are simple but solid folks. From rock to dance and a little in between I could not say enough about this band. At times heavy 808s and analog bases I mean seriously! Their Hot and they Love JESUS... "We're resting in the shadow of the cross." Amen! enjoy "CHURCH MUSIC"
1	Love it.
1	Surprised my husband with these cd's & he is happy.
1	LOVE BROMBERG
1	I loved it! It sounds great works awesome,  thank you so much. I highly recommend seller
1	I like Dusty Springfield and this song was as good as I remembered way back when. I got it on Amazon digital music  Iii d
1	This is a little heartbreaking.  I can not say I am an activist for gay rights, but I am sympathetic to the cause.  I think the true message of this song is to watch your words.  You really never know who you are affecting with what you say and your words are more powerful than you think.  Guard your tongue people!
1	Loved this lively arrangement of Arirang. Nicely done!
1	This is a great collection of Bruno Mars' music. I love all the songs except one. I recommend this product
1	If you like Stevie Wonder you will love this song.  This song made everyone love it after the Best Man came out but it was not included on soundtrack.
1	whoever originally wrote this song is amazing...  i think it describes her very much, as far as her music goes.  i totally fell in love with this mid-tempo instantly. the FIRST time i played her "too-country" debut.  i liked about 5 tracks a LOT.  jesus take the wheel wasn't one of them (until recently).  if i went back, i might find 1 or 2 more gems, but i totally prefer her outstandingly-accessible sophomore effort, carnival ride.  much more fun to sing along to, hummable and songs like twisted, last name and get out of this town are still joys to my heart. wheel of the world is sounding a bit less repetitive because i'm actually absorbing the lyrics now!  but this song will probably always be precious to me, for my heart has never, truly been broke, relationship-wise.  guess i'm still waiting (for it all!)...:^D  4.5-lyrics (enthusiastic/believe-able) 4.75-sound (enchanting) 4.375-vocal work (wow, esp. for pop!) 4.25-emotion (good, but ending gave it edge.)  5+ stars. (not (EVER) an overall grade)  end note: the drums are so nice, as well as the enchanting piano that lingers, while creating an atmospheric-beginning. while i heard the song in my head before playing it, i SWORE it was the production floating. that's how emotional it is for me. not crying emotional, just moved. and my position in life makes me look at the song so..
1	Great song!
1	a beautiful, haunting song while Niamh was at her best
1	Wonderful songs! Pure Ronnie Dunn!
1	What can you say about these guys, excellent!
1	great song and lyrics
1	great beats
1	Luther was the best!
1	If I had to pick one song off the record it would be SOVEREIGN OVER US. It song is a so heart touching witch is so need in this day in age. A Humbleness comes over me when I here this song. I pray it does the same for you to.  God Bless
1	Was nice sounding but some lyric analizers play too much into unclassy meanings iykwim
1	A very blessed song from a very blessed young lady.  Only the Spirit of God can bring such authority and power through a song.  So glad to be free!
1	best cd ever!
1	It is one of those recordings that ether you like it or you don't.  Way back in the days of my youth I was an active Boy Scout.  When I first heard this song, the opening was like seeing the morning sun on a weekend that would be filled with many roaring adventures...In my mind, this song was the back-beat to a fantasy film that captured me and all of my scouting friends fishing, walking the creek, canoing, hiking, and all the other many things we would do out in the wilderness.  Now whenever I hearit, I always play those memories and return to thos woods where we had so many wonderful adventures...Lame, I know, but this is how this song touched my heart.
1	Keith Urban's hot guitar playing is the bonus to a great vocal combination of Swift and McGraw, two of the best.
1	Great song.
1	Wishing they brought back the fiddle for this one, but it was great all the same! Hope they keep on producing!
1	Stay is one of the most powerful songs I've heard in a long time. While I'm not a fan of Rihanna this song compares very favorably with Adelle's In the Deep. It has a hypnotic beat provided by piano chords gently delivered and a breathy vocal that aches with emotion. The line Rihanna sings is I want you to stay but the haunting voice with which it is delivered is a cry of pain. A remarkable piece of work which suggests that perhaps I need to listen to some of her other work before I consign her to " don't care for her"
1	Zapp - their first hit. I remember buying this album in 1980 - I also remember this song jamming at a block party in "The Locks" in Miami.
1	Awesome music good tone  just great overall music I think the beat the tone the fluctuation of it is just great
1	I love the music played on here. It's so beautiful and it's being played so elegantly. I am a very hard person to get to sleep and if music without any other homeopathic remedies can calm my anxiety as well, there is No reason to get this. This is an exclusive gift from Amazon, and what a deal! This is great :-)
1	Just what I expected and wanted I have no problems with this product and would recommend this product to anyone interested in  this type of item.  Thanks and shop on.
1	In difficult times such as now, this is the true kind of music that people need to hear. Everything about this song feels good, it's message is very clear, the production is spellbinding. This song is a true hit. Monica's tone is amazing, her voice is so strong you can help but to want to listen to it, it was a religious experience hearing her voice. There so many moments in the song that touch. If you are a true fan of good soul and R&B and have a ear for good music or even a Pop fan, you would get this record.  I say 5 stars!
1	This song is amazing! It has an amazing beat and is so catchy! It's a great party or club song! Definitely worth the buy!
1	Arrived in great condition. Thank you!
1	Good
1	I choose this song as it was my husband and myself's special song. My husband passed away and I'm haveing a memorial service for him and I'm having this song to be played at his service. If there were more stars, I would have checked them all. Thank you so much.  Ellen Hodges
1	If you enjoy this genre check out all of Mr. Tisdale's work.
1	So apparently Ed Sheeran is quite an Artist, but I do not remember ever hearing his name before.  Cheers Ed!
1	Love this song
1	I am posting this review for one reason only, Track 14 of this CD is the original Disconet version of the hard to find (in any version) "Hold On To My Love" (Extended Remix) by Jimmy Ruffin, it has the same length of my original vinyl and at the time of this review it can be purchased used for as low as a penny, most "New recordings" albums can have a one (1) star by default but because of its inclusion and the price (+ shipping) it is cheaper than what I paid for the vinyl single back in the day so I am inclined to a better rating just on the strength of this song.  The listing is as follows:  1. Sabrina - Boys (Summertime Love) (Original) [3:58] 2. Dollar - Give Me Back My Heart (Original) [4:27] 3. Simon Harris - Bass (How Low Can You Go?) (Original) [3:18] 4. Odyssey - Use it up and Wear it out (New Recording) [4:14] 5. Matchbox - Midnite Dynamos (New Recording) [2:59] 6. Hazell Dean - They Say It's Gonna Rain [6:39] 7. Stephanie Mills - Never Knew Love like This Before (Live) [2:38] 8. Barbara Pennington - On A Crowded Street [4:14] 9. Bad Manners - Special Brew [3:20] 10. The Nolans - Who's Gonna Rock You [3:15] 11. Toto Coelo - Mucho Macho (Live) [3:28] 12. Evelyn Thomas - Masquerade [3:35] 13. Sugar Minott - Good Thing Going [3:16] 14. Jimmy Ruffin - Hold On To My Love (Original Disconet Version) [8:25] 15. Sister Sledge - Thinking Of You [3:53] 16. Bucks Fizz - The Land of Make Believe (New Recording) [3:35] 17. Ranking Roger of The Beat - Mirror in the Bathroom (New Recording) [3:14] 18. Kajagoogoo - Ooh to Be Ah (New Recording) [3:53] 19. Kool & the Gang - Get Down On It (Live) [2:07] 20. Miquel Brown - He's A Saint, He's A Sinner (Original) [5:18]  The re-recorded versions are really hard to spot (at least for me), others I don't know them so I cannot help with their provenance but as I said in the beginning if you are looking for Jimmy Ruffin get this while you can. By the way nowhere in the original back insert states this fact that I found by mere chance when I bought it at a used CD store.
1	If you are a serious lover of "smooth jazz", then you must get this! Without this CD in your collection, it is definitely "incomplete!!"
1	The band follows the jazz tradition of Django Reinhardt and the Hot Club of Paris.  They are very, very good.  I bought this after seeing them live, one of the best live acts I've seen in many years, and it has the same full-tilt "hot jazz" feel that used to be popular decades ago but has sort of fallen out of favor.  Melodic, harmonic, not necessarily something you would sing or whistle, but really makes you want to dance.  If you like the sound of Django, think of this as his latest album and you'll be pretty close.
1	I love Toby Mac. His songs are so unique with a great beat and a good Christiam message. This
1	ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!!!
1	Though there are many great songs on this album if you only buy one be sure it's "The day the music died".
1	Sometimes a song just strikes a chord with you and this is one of those for me.  I do enjoy listening to this one.
1	Tyte Trakk
1	This is an awesome deal! - All of Mozart's solo piano compositions for one to enjoy. Sound quality is excellent and the price is incredible. Period!
1	It's Prince!
1	I'm 62 years old, my goddaughter is 10. It amazes me how much I like her music as much as the "old school" stuff I listen to.
1	I absolutely loved the movie Marigold. It's over the top, ridiculous and fabulous all at the same time. I have watched it over and over again to replay all the amazing dance numbers and to enjoy the American version of Bollywood entertainment. The soundtrack is just the same. The music is great, the songs are all songs from the movie and it's great for driving and singing in the car. My only complaint is that the soundtrack is a little too short. Otherwise, I would recommend it to anyone who loved Marigold!
1	Johnnie has been around since I was a kid but he has been consistent his whole life.  This album is mellow and stirs up many wonderful memories of his earlier albums.  He is truly one of a kind and I wish him many continued years of success.  His kindness to mankind shows through his superb voice and choice of songs.  Enjoy!
1	This may be his best CD yet.  You can really put this on and just ride.  I have to put it on shuffle because the way the songs are laid out it takes you from mello to high.  But overall good quality so far I think my fav is fumble and of course dive in!
1	First off, this is a beautiful CD.  But if you're looking for the monster acoustic version of Michael Gulezian, I'd recommend the more recent (and astoundingly great) release, "Language of the Flame."  The Dare of an Angel features additional instrumentation besides acoustic guitar.  That usually spells disaster for guitar soloists out to expand their sonic palate, but the good news is that Gulezian completely avoids that trap - this music snaps and jumps, sparkles and breathes, and is very much alive.  The percussion (Ian Dogole), piano (Ira Stein), violin (Charlie Bisharat), and bass (Michael Manring!) seem wholly written and integrated into the compositions, serving as the perfect setting for an acoustic guitar that shines like a diamond.  The melding of third-world rhythms to percussive twelve string guitar is especially notable.  This CD is on par with some of the best work Ralph Towner did with Oregon.  There are a handful of solo pieces, and they are delivered with all the subtle authority you'd expect from Gulezian.  But the real story here is the teamwork, lack of ego, and absence of showboating.  These players are some of the best instrumentalists in existence, a fact made more obvious by the complete absence of gymnastics.  There's more than enough energy - this is simply some of the most exquisitely understated music I've ever heard.  It's as if the musicians became invisible on this outing, leaving us alone in the ether of pure sound.  Gulezian may be a solo acoustic guitar monster, but here it's much more about beauty, and the collective synergy among master musicians.  Favorite track:  "Nothing Is Always Anything."  Definitely recommend buying this disc.
1	Favorite Traffic Album!
1	The music is timeless...plus, I'm replacing my vinyl collection.
1	Great
1	i absolutely love this cd!  every single song sticks in your head!  lovelovelove it! it even makes this old woman want to dance
1	A timeless love song that is as appealing now as it was in 1978.
1	Works well as a background sound for sleeping or studying when outside noise can cause problems. Slightly different tone than "white sound," so one should listen to it before purchasing.  If set for continuous play, there will be a pause after 70 minutes, so there is a brief interruption of the sound. Consequently, for sleeping, its not quite as good as having a sound masking machine. But given the fact such machines are now hard to find, it makes for a good substitute, especially when travelling.
1	love
1	Awesome!
1	This song has irresistible guitar and a peppy, happy sound.  Great hook, and a compelling rhythm.  Liked it so much I made it my ring tone.
1	Very good album, perhaps a little too apologetic
1	Classic Country Music with a double entendre meaning......
1	I'm a woman and this is a great song that I can't stop singing.  GREAT JOB. I thank God for REAL singing without that machine sound. AWESOME!
1	One of Metallica's best.  Comparing the original to the remaster I don't really notice any difference other than loudness, which is fine by me.  I hadn't listened to this album in a while and I really noticed the lack of overall bass on this album, it was almost thin to me throughout.  Not that you can't hear Burton's bass or anything like that...there just wasn't much "oomph" in the sound.  It's probably due to the production/ recording methods of the time.  Otherwise A+ classic Metallica.
1	It is ok to listen to in the background.  He has a relaxing style.
1	really love the album version of the song but the live version is awesome. Johnnie Taylor at his very best.
1	The album is AMAZING! Neil and Ryan's voices mesh so well together. Love them. Buy this album, you won't regret it!
1	Another great song ... wow ! Sang it at my sons wedding !
1	This relaxation program has all key elements of relaxation programs and is a scriptural based reference.  I like it so much because it draws me closer to God.
1	Even though David Guetta doesn't play any instruments, he sure has a string of great songs with his song on the album cover!!
1	loved the movie XXX love the song , good to hear trying to stay awake driving home from work !!!!
1	i love this song it really lets the one you love know that they can count on you
1	Great song about love.

1	she works hard for the money by donna summer captures the experience of the working woman that goes through the joys and challenges of balancing her daily responsibilities with the necessity of making enough money to pay for the essentials of life and more.  The vocals to the song are also well done and I like how this song musically tells a story from the singers  perspective on how she views the working woman.
1	Great song, the best song ever by ratt, and one of the best songs from 1980s rock era. Cheap.
1	This album has four to five great old-time rock hits from Billy Squier to Joe Walsh and Enimem adds a current rap and beat that makes these songs come alive again. Nobody does it better.
1	LIKE!
1	Was one of my favorite songs of the 60's. Have the 45, but it was in bad shape. Glad to find it
1	Excellent album (5 CD coffret) for real Nana Mouskouri's fans. All her songs in Spanish. Congratulations and thanks to Mercury France Records for this release. This is our good fortune to have now on CD songs like "El pequeo tamborilero" (Spanish version for L'enfant au tambour), "Rosa de Paris", "Las maanitas, live in a Paris concert" (Mexican folk song for celebrating a happy birthday to someone)and more. Really, this is a very good treasure in a beautiful and magical voice !!!! Nevertheless, two more songs were not included in this compilation. 1) "Coucourrucoucou paloma", Mexican and so Latinamerican song,version live in a concert about 1972 in Holland, sung half in Spanish, half in English and 2) "El amor es (Liebe ist)", Mexican author: Juan Gabriel. From 1995, sung half in Spanish and half in German. Anyway, the 5 CD box set is wonderful. Don't miss it !!!
1	The first Diva of Rap is back and better and harder than ever. Foxy returns to the ghetto hood of the streets to give us some of her best work in years. On this cd, Foxy lets you know that she is NOT to be [...] with when it comes to delivering hardcore eastcoast Hip Hop. Some of the outstaning tracks on Broken Silence are "Oh Yeah", "So Hot" "Candy" and my favorite "Na Na Be Like". If your a true Rap/Hip Hop fan you will not be dissapointed with what Foxy brings to the table on Broken Silence...... all I can say is Lil' Kim and Eve beware cuz the First Diva of Rap is back and Badder than Ever......
1	Thumbs up!!!
1	if you are looking for great fiddle music give this a try .. dewey plays with ralph Stanley and the clinch mountain boys . this is not found in music stores . , maybe found in Nashville , but since I rarely get to go there  I was very glad to be able to buuy this  cd. great mountain music!
1	Classic album by the wonderful crooner of all times!!!  I happen to love this singer and I would recommend to all!
1	Love it.  Fun lyrics for Christmastime.
1	Love this song. MP3 quality was great. I've used it to DJ in a bar and the sound quality was excellent.
1	This is a very Great sounding CD with a lotta back in the Day cutz on it....
1	an oldie but goodie
1	This song caught my ear and I had to have it. The jazzy tones within the song are on point! And once I found out that he was from Detroit, I was quite happy in buying this song.
1	Rebelution is such and incredible band. This CD is perfect 4 calm listening. My boyfriend and I love listening to the CD on night drives. We bought the CD in anticipation for their upcoming concert in our area. If you like reggae style music this CD is perfect for you.
1	Bizzle delivers with a great cd with features from alot of popular guys in the industry.  All proceeds go to building wells in Africa and other places in need.  Get this CD
1	Well made and a good buy.
1	I needed a copy of this song for my daughters college play.  It worked out great.  Thank you.
1	Give God your all is what I got from this amazing EP from KB. This full of great content from beginning to very end! We serve a great all mighty God. His son Jesus is Undefeated nothing can stop him and nothing can stop us either!  Thank you KB for this wonderful inspiration music! I would recommend this to anyone.  Must have EP!
1	just as expected wife loved it
1	this should be enough of an endorsement right there. melodic, soulful, musical. this has it all. for the sax lover this is a treat. for the jazz lover this is desert. for the music lover meat & potatoes
1	Well constructed songs complimented by beautiful melodies high lite the time tested musician.
1	Like the song
1	Nice Bowie compilation. Never followed him in his Ziggy days, but think I started listening to him with Diamond Dogs. One of the most creative people in music/film/theater/whatever scene. Too bad he says he's retired. Well, he has said that before.
1	Classic. You can't get any better than this.
1	Fantastic song!
1	Prince at his sexiest!
1	I think someone's enjoying of this music depends very much on taste, and what they are expecting. In one case, there is the music of Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground. This can be classified as music to listen to whilst eating corn-on-the-cob. Folks expecting this will be at least surprised and maybe disappointed if that is all they like. On the other hand is the music of John Zorn, which can be classified as music to listen to whilst eating okra. This album is definitely the second kind. It is not music to be listened to casually. It demands the listener's attention. I have found, if I give it my attention, I hear alternations between cacophony and traditional Western melodic music. Based on my personal taste, I like it. I just have to make sure I have enough okra.
1	Come on, it's Sail Away by Randy Newman.  What else is there to say that hasn't already been said?
1	...and let Marit Peters set your mood.  Marit seems to examine the deepest corners of her mind and heart, then pour her thoughts and emotions directly onto the CD.  Everyone will find something to identify with, from  loneliness (Angels Hovering) to desperation (Marie).  Marit is a wordsmith  of the highest order.  You'll find yourself backtracking to hear again the  poignant description of outwardly normal photos belying a dysfunctional  family in "Mother's Mantle". Come to think of it, you'd better  make those headphone wireless, because the upbeat "Beautiful  Girls" and the sultry "Dinosaur" will have you  dancing. The music itself is exquisitely spare, which gives the musicians  in this band plenty of room to innovate.  In particular, the keyboard work  is tremendous; the bass lines fluid and always moving; and the addition of  a trumpet to many of the songs sets this sound apart from mainstream pop.  The music also matches perfectly with the lyrics.  Each completes the mood  set by the other.  Marit's voice is an instrument in itself--it's a  low-throated vamp in "Dinosaur", and it soars on  "Theater". A perfect example of the creative nature of this CD  is "Noah's Ark": a haunting story of a man's efforts to spare his  family from himself, told in turn by the man, his wife, and his daughter.  You'll play this song over and over; then you'll take off the wireless  headphones, call someone, and tell them how much you love them.  Thank God  you can also listen to "Shiny Things" again to make your heart  and head soar.
1	Love this song
1	GREAT SONG !
1	Great music when one wants quiet with just some mostly gentle classical music.
1	I think Pharell is a really talented producer as well as an artist.  I gave this song five stars because it just makes you happy singing it. When I first heard it, I thought to myself... finally a song inspiring people to be happy!  I think I am becoming a Pharell Williams fan. I definitely would recommend this song to others because there are a lot of people out here who need to here this song and work on being happy!  Great job Pharell!
1	this was my first Motorhead Album - never liked them, but upon hearing the opening track "Runaround Man" i was in... That song is so good it caused me to purchase the CD - the whole album is awesome from start to finish.
1	I could not wait to go home and buy the CD after watching the show on Broadway and I have not been disappointed.  Listening to this brings me back to my theater seat and i can picture all of the artists doing the numbers on stage again.  Absolutely wonderful songs but not sure you would love it if you have not seen the show. I hope they come out with a movie based on the Broadway musical.
1	Put it on my KindleFire so I can have it at my fingertips where ever I am.  Wonderful songs and piano playing
1	She has the most beautiful voice ever!!
1	Very enjoyable CD
1	Love this song and a Charlie Brown Christmas.  Lots of others do as well after so many years of the animated feature being on TV.  I bought the song during the holidays after hearing a chorus singing it during a Christmas concert.  I stll love Charles Schultz's work and all the Peanuts characters.  Nothing represents them as wll as Christmas time is here anc Vince Guaraldi.
1	All of the music from this Band is excellent! The download of the song was fast and easy and I have had no problems with playing, moving or copying it to CD.
1	I am 28 years old and have listened to heavy music for about 22 of them. As the bands got heavier, I got heavier. But now my growth process has stopped, there is nothing heavier!!!When I heard Rob Flynn was starting a new band  after Vio-lence split I wasn't terribly interested. The guitar crunch was  great but Sean Killian's vocals were to much to bear. Anyway, I got the cd  and was blown away,the songwriting, the bottom heavy guitars,the singing  and even the melodic stuff were there, tightly packaged into probably (dare  I say) the best heavy album ever. Thank-you Robb the breakup of Vio-lence  was the best thing the metal world could have.
1	I bought this for my brother for their baby shower and he loves it!  He and I are both very big Weezer fans, so when I found the lullaby renditions I knew he had to have it for his daughter.  He has said he loves listening to it with his daughter and since there are no actual words on the cd he can sing to her.  It also puts her right to sleep! :)
1	Absolutely beautiful bluegrass rendition of this popular classic. Never get tired of listening to it again and again and again.
1	willy at his best
1	When I was browing songs on YouTube, I came across this song and the first time I heard it, I fell in love with it. If you buy it, I guarantee you will love it to!
1	I got this album because I liked Keyshia.  She didn't disappoint me.  Her album is very good and recommend it to everyone.
1	Love love love Michael Jackson and this one is one of my favorites
1	Even 'old' songs can give a fresh perspective. ELO's timeless piece still hits me in the muse.
1	Loved it
1	Mono sounds great
1	This album is a masterpiece...
1	One of my favorites
1	Absolutely love this new Dylan album. Loved his last "standards" album Shadows in the Night too but this is arguably an even better song selection and he performs these classics with real feeling and obvious passion for the material. I really lament the so called fans who expect rerun after rerun of Highway 61 Revisited or Blonde on Blonde; the same people who go to his concerts expecting to see a 25 year old Dylan singing songs from over 40 years ago just like he sang them 40 years ago and then moan that "he's not like he used to be". Times and people change and so has Dylan. We should feel privileged to live at the same time this extraordinary artist  is still performing and producing great music
1	I always liked Floyd Cramer's unique way to render country tunes on the piano. His style is very smooth and soothing, very appealing. This one has always been one of my favorites. This song was originally recorded by Skeeter Davis, as far as I know. The sound is very good.
1	I love this song, it reminds me that God is in control. I would definitely recommend this song to others.
1	There's nothing more I can say about this song exceot that it is a beautiful song. Just press repeat :)
1	a silly song from my youth that i have had a hard time finding- until now! I am very happy.
1	As noted in a Sammy Davis on-line sessionography, "Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone" features a 40-second interlude beginning at 1:03 in which Sammy rants on a couple of topics including his tight pants, the south of France and "diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks". It's unknown if this was a UK- or US-only feature on LP. The segment has been edited out of all CD reissues with the exception of the 2004 Warner Jazz CD reissue of "The Sounds of '66".  This download version, however, includes the dialog sequence, and that was the reason for me purchasing the track.  I have the CD, but my physical copy unfortunately has the edited version of the song.
1	This is a splendid rendition of an older song originally recorded and released by 'The Five Satins' in 1956. I hit the charts in that year. Notably, it returned to the charts in 1960 and again in 1961. It is said that this and another song can take credit for being the origin of the Doo-Wop style of music. Ronnie Milsap, known to be a country singer and pianist, recorded this version in 1985. I think Ronnie did an excellent job with this tune. I like it a lot. Actually, I like it more than the original recording. The MP3 sound is amazingly good. Highly recommended.
1	this album is a classic, one of the later Janis Joplin albums.  one thing, the track "one Night Stand" is probably the one big hit track on this CD.  because of this I did, just download the track "one Night Stand" this CD has some other tracks that are good for some real hard Janis Joplin fans, though.
1	Good buy!
1	I have been looking for this item and finally found it, I appreciate it. I love it, I love it. Thank you
1	Great Song!!
1	Katherine Jenkins is one of the best female vocalist I have ever heard.  The versatility of her voice is amazing. I am truely a new forever fan.  Barb  Hear more??? Thanx to Dancing With the Stars for introducing her to america. You just have to take the time to listen to one of her CD's.  She can, in my book, sing any type of music out there. You just have to give her a try.  Barb again.
1	This would be 6 stars if there were 3 or 5 more songs on the record. 9 is not enough. Especially of this stuff!  I'm not gonna do a song-by-song review here; I think that's pretentious. But I will say that every song is a winner in it's own right. And Kevin's yodeling is really getting good. I know the ghost of Don Walser is smiling.
1	Love it!!!!
1	great beat and very cool tune
1	Good price and fast shipping.
1	This song has such a dark history and a dark tone. I love how sad it is and yet how beautiful it is. Sarah Brightman's voice never dissapoints though and it is as beautiful as ever. Soft and melodic yet has this strangely raspy tone. It's hard to describe her voice but it's truly amazing. This song is slow and if you're having a bad day is a wonderful listen if you want to feel even sadder.
1	I love The song! I Love Every thing about him n songs! I Love them all!!
1	I am giving this song 5 Stars because it was my Fathers song from many years ago. He is no longer with us and now really listening to that song,  this the way he felt towards my Mom.  I am getting married in September and this is the song that will he played as I am walking out in memory of my Dad. Plus this is how I feel towards the love of my life.
1	Great song
1	I pre-ordered this album and planned on writing a review, which was put off over and over again.  After reading reviews, I thought a one-year review would be good.  I read a lot of what I consider "knee-jerk" reaction to the album, so, after one year and plenty of time to listen to it, here is my take on Fly from Here.  Whatever your favorite album is by Yes (mine being Going for the One), this is the best one since then.  Nothing I have heard over the last year comes close to the enjoyment I get from this album and I hope that anyone who gives it some time will discover the same thing.  I have listened to this album more in the last year than anything else I own.   On first listen, i did have some hesitation at times as to how good it was, that's where a bit of patient listening paid off.  The quality and creativity of the music comes though over time, even with Jon and Rick not being involved.  Benoit does a wonderful job bringing his own sound to the band, and the three part harmonies sound as good as they ever were.  Geoff is a great keyboard player, as were all the others, and it may be because he used his classic keyboards that this album sounds so great to me.  I thought Magnification was great, but it is the keyboards that really make the difference in the total sound.  There seem to be others who know the origins of the Horn/Downes tracks better than I, so I refer you to them.  From a lyrical standpoint, I really like this album because it seems more focused on interesting word pictures and not so much of the cerebral-introspective and socital examination that was much more heavy in the last handful of albums.   As for the songs, here's my take on them:   All of suite Fly from Here is more like a collection of songs that were tied together with short instrumental pieces and some common lyrics, but still stand well on there own.   FFH:Overture  It grabs your attention and feels like the classic days of Yes   FFH: We Can Fly  I never heard this when it was played on the Drama tour, but it was well worth the wait.  Nice driving bass, original guitar work, unlike anything I hear anyone doing these days, and the keyboards are just the right tones to fill it out nicely.   FFH: Sad Night at the Airfield  Very nice acoustic work at the beginning with just the right keyboard accompaniment.  For a nearly 7:00 minute section, it goes by too quickly, especially the outstanding steel guitar work at the end.  Some of the finest in years.  I've only heard David Gilmour's work on High Hopes sound close to this.  Ominous and beautiful at the same time.   FFH: Madman at the Screens  A return to the overture theme, this one is heavier and drives pretty good.  Has some great organ work near the end.   FFH: Bumpy Ride  One of the parts that took me a bit off guard because it seems slightly out-of-place, but it grows on you over time and you get used to it.  It does have this somewhat happy feel to it.   FFH: We Can Fly Reprise  Also a bit odd coming in, reminded me of the very end of Tull's Thick as a Brick, sort of like the radio was suddenly turned up and here's this piece of music.  Other than the odd intro, it closes down the whole piece nicely.   The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be:  Feels like it was drawn a bit more from the acousticness of the 80's or early 90's.  A very nice example of allowing different instruments to have there own parts and not crowd each other.  The bass riff at the end is very nice and guitarists could learn a lot from Steve here.  You don't have to use loud distortion all the time, just use a few notes here and there to build what you want.   Life on a Film Set:  This is the best example of word pictures on the album, not like we have heard since probably Tormato.  A nice acoustic guitar and keyboard mix on the first half, into a very upbeat second half.  The second half sounds very happy and fun, sort of like the very end of Sound Chaser and it's playfulness with the "la la la's" although there are no "la's" here.   Hour of Need:  Sound wise the first thing I thought of was Wonderous Stories or Nine Voices because of the Portugese Guitar that leads.  Not heavy and very thought provoking.   Solitaire:  Steve's guitar solo.  I feel like you are watching someone taking a walk though the countryside.  Music can create pictures in your mind.   Into the Storm:  My one surprise was the lack of talk about this song.  This is the crown jewel of the album.  Nothing captures the feel of the 70's better than this one and it's been a awful long time since I've heard anything that musically brings me as much joy as this piece.  Chris has a bass sound most like what was used on Tormato, the guitar has just the right amount of bite to give the song drive, but not overwhelm anything else.  The keyboards accompany it perfectly and the drums tie it all up.  The other shock is the vocals, sounds just like the harmonies on Yours is No Disgrace.  The tempo changes are seamless, as good as anything I've heard in a long time.  Honestly, I can't do justice to how good this song is.  One of the greatest things is the musical outro.  It is the best musical closing they have done since Ritual, and it literally feels like you can see a plane flying off into a storm.   The question is, if this is the last album by Yes, is it a worthy bookend to their career?  Absolutely!  I know the line-up may not be what everyone would have hoped for, but in the end it's the music that the fans of Yes truly care about, and here they have succeeded in making a musically satisfying album.  So, before you jump ship on buying this album because of some of the poor knee-jerk reviews, give it a try, give it several listens and decide.  In the end, I don't think you will be disappointed in what you hear.
1	This song was featured at the end of the excellent movie "Rush Hour 2". It has a nice beat and makes you want to sing and dance like Michael!
1	This has a very unusual melody.  Josh's voice suits it.  Sublime!  One of my favorites.
1	Very relaxing, will put you to sleep ;)
1	This was a new songs to me, but when I saw that it was done by Michael W. Smith, I decided to download it.  I now am very much in love with this song.  Great download.
1	Very well put!
1	Her early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Immaculate came out in '90, I think she really came into her own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. She's been compared to Cindy Lauper, but I think Madonna has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
1	Always loved this song
1	Awesome song! Very moving lyrics.
1	I was in ninth grade when I saw the TV ad for this album and ordered the LP.  I remember recording it on 8-track.  I could have, but did not take better care of the LP.  I'm glad someone took good care of this LP all these years.
1	One of the best Sophomore albums out there.  They did not drop the ball as so many other bands do after they put out the first one.  Very powerful and well worth the small cost.
1	My daughter and I absolutely love this song. It makes for a great ringtone for our phones! Sounds great and easy to download
1	Just what my son wanted.  (He heard a clip in a movie.)
1	I choose this song for a children;s workshop I am conducting on appreciating our differences and acknowledging the "jewels"  (kindness, patience, creativity, etc.)  within all of us.. This song wraps the lessons up beautifully!  The tune is  simple and catchy Even adults  feel "wonderful" after hearing it!
1	I heard the song "Watchmen, What's Left..." on Gossip Girl and was instantly hooked. Now that I've heard the entire album I want more! This band is on par with The Killers, Muse, and The Shins. I'll be anxiously awaiting whatever they put out next.
1	Who does not like Pink.
1	The album is dark and soulful. But more importantly the guitar player is so cute !
1	I'm going to see him in Lille on the 9 th june....yepp Thank you very much . . . .
1	I saw these amazing fellas on The Sing Off, and was instantly in love. I about cried when they won and counted down the days until their album release. It did not disappoint! I'm so happy these incredibly talented gentlemen are finally able to share their voices with the world.
1	Ronnie Dunn does it again!! :)
1	Too bad Glenn Yarbrough didn't have other great hits like this one. The movie was pretty fine as well if you're in to old black and whites!
1	Great band and good music. I really enjoy this song. Very relaxing always puts me in a good mood. Keep them coming.
1	First off, I have to admit that Im not a big fan of the Eagles (they just never did anything for me. Dont beat on me for that. Im just putting the review in perspective.)  I am a big fan of classic country music (Waylon, Willie, Dolly, Merle, etc.) I put on this CD and from track 1 (where else are you going to find Miranda Lambert sharing lead vocals with Mick Jagger and  of course  Henley) I was hooked. This was a damn good country record. And by now you probably know all the other guests who harmonize with Henley on the 16 tracks here. MOST  not all  of the songs are newly penned by Henley and his writing partner Stan Lynch. For a cover Henley chose the classic Jesse Winchester song Brand New Tennessee Waltz and it works great. I already see trhere are 117 reviews posted here before me (I just got the CD) so I won't rehash what others said.  The CD itself comes in a tri-fold digipak and contains a 16-page booklet with all the lyrics. This allows you to, not only sing along if you want to, but lets you read the poetry in the well-crafted lyrics.  I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.  Steve Ramm Anything Phonographic
1	I like this new musical.
1	A very powerful and ministering song.  It was recommended to me by our First Lady at church.  It is such a blessing.
1	Love head banging to this classic!
1	I am not sure why, but this is the last National Skyline album I picked up. The samples just didn't make me want to run off and buy it. I was suprised to find that this is the most original and consistent of the Skyline albums. Although I think nothing here comes close to 'A Million Circles' from This=Everything, this album is good all the way through (whereas This=Everything is kind of all over the place). There are four instrumentals - what some might consider 'filler' tracks  (40% of the album)- but even these are interesting and I never skip thru them.  The rest of the tracks, however are awesome. There are clear nods to the Cure, early U2, Radiohead and more recent Sonic Youth. Lots of shoegazing guitar that somehow avoids all the stereotypes of shoegazing. Jeff has a unique voice and creates a dark, savory atmosphere - perfect for a late-night drive or a cold grey day.  Best songs: Kingdom, Glimmer, Edge of the World. The accoustic b-side of Edge of the World is also pretty good, putting a darker tinge on the song.
1	I enjoy the music and the vocals.  I am so tired of the over synthesized vocals in todays songs. Tired of the gutter, raunchy lyrics.  "Hey Brother" might not be a dance song (at least for me), but its definitely toe tapping. The rhythmic beat cant help but pull you in.  The kids love singing it from the back of the car.  But in the truest test, would I put it on my MP3 player?  Yes.  Two thumbs up to that.  Why not 5 stars?  Well a 5 star song is one that moves me beyond words, beyond description.  I like this song alot, but its not in that class (for me).  Still very enjoyable.  Buy and Enjoy
1	I enjoy very much.  I have been enjoying it very much.  I has met all of the needs that I want it to.
1	this is classic, and even tho this song has many remakes, i personally think this one is the best.  HA HA HO HO HE HE to the funny farm where everything is beautiful all the time!
1	He got it for a gift and listens to it all the time. Says its a lady singing?  David a girl?
1	Don't stop with this song, buy the whole album.  Michael W. Smith outdid himself here.  Holds up over time.  Great performances.
1	I was first introduced to the styles of Chris Mann when he was touring with the great, Idina Menzel. Hearing she was to have a opening act. I looked him up. Found his site which played some of his songs. Learned he is not only a singer, but song writer and writes most of his songs. He can play a few instruments. That's talent folks! Anyway, I really enjoyed listening to them. While at Idina's and Chris's show. I bought a one of the CD he had available. Which I really enjoy listening to. His combination of Pop and R&B with a blast of Soul. I instantly became one of the Mann's fan. Was excited when he finally issues some new music that I was able to buy. His EP is might be only 5 tracks. But they are some really great songs! The most stand out is his cover of Heartless, by Kanye West. Now before I start, I know some will probably say that he did this cause a Idol singer sang it as well. Well, First off, Chris did his cover longer before Kris Allen did his on Idol. Chris Mann even did a video for it. Which he had help from many of his Twitter followers. Anyway, Chris took the song and truly made it his own. Which is why many who have heard the different versions out there consider it one of the best.  The rest of the EP, The Weight of Your World, which he wrote a few months ago. Is another wonderful song. The original version he previewed earlier this year was a bit slower. But this version is the best.  One of the newer songs, If I Can't Make You Happy is just beautiful! This is so far my favorite track on the EP. The last two tracks, When The Lights Fade and 8 Story Walkup. I consider 2 of his classics. When The Lights Fade is a beautiful slow ballad. And 8 Story Walkup is is a song about the anticipation of being with the person you love. This song is a good make out or more song. In short, for $5 you can beat owning this EP of this star who is on the rise! LUBCHU!
1	Uptempo and Uplifting!
1	Keith Harkin's album succeeds in its selection of songs that compliment each other as well as covering covering several musical genres. I also really enjoyed listening to the musicians.  I especially like the arrangement for the End of the Innocence. Of course, the many original songs are extremely fun, insightful and curious. I can't wait for the tour.
1	The sound quality is there, and there are many familiar hits for people who don't listen to Classical music on a regular basis to recognize and enjoy. The sound quality is about as well as could be expected from mp3 compression, and I appreciate that on most if not all tracks you are not subjected to the sounds of the orchestra players' breathing or talking as with some other albums. While most of these tracks can not by any means be classified as horror, most are either melancholy or exhilarating. What it really comes down to, the reason I couldn't deduct a single star, is that you get 100 songs for just over a penny each. So delete the 95 songs, so you uncultured cretins don't care for, or probably won't listen to again, and you'll still get your money's worth.
1	Great
1	what can you say.  Adele is extremely talented, and this is a song everyone should have on their play list.
1	A very fine grouping of songs from a band of the latter 1960s to the 1970s, and beyond...  They are still around today on the oldies circuit, even though lead singer Johnny Maestro recently passed.  "The Brooklyn Bridge" were formed from the chance unification of two smaller bands, which 'worked', and ... so instantly becoming an eleven member outfit!  The great classic "The Worst That Could Happen", a Jimmy Webb song, appears here, along with one other song of his.  But the band had numerous other interesting hits.  Included of course is the memorable first album cover, featuring a montage of the band against a silhouette of the physical Brooklyn Bridge.  One song missing is "Requiem", but nonetheless, this is a great collection for fans of the group.
1	I was 18yrs old when the Exorcist came out in movie theaters. We were having dinner with friends one evening and began discussing the movie and the impact it had on us at that time. The one thing we all agreed on was the tubular bells music and how even today 30 some odd years later we still get the heebie geebies when we hear it. I downloaded the track just for kicks and we all took a little journey back in time. I also have it on my ipod and everynow and then it plays randomly. Creeeepie, LOL but I love it.
1	Out of print, hard to find, but worth it. Produced by Michael Stipe (of REM) in the early 1990s, this album is full of rockin indy tunes (ala Sebadoh/Pavement from that time). There's also a very sweet ballad that gives me chills every time I listen to it - "I want to be with you." I heard they're reissuing the album in 2005 - I hope it's true!
1	Ingrid and the children did a wonderful job. Watching the video[...] you can see the hope and sorrow in their faces.  This is such a touching tribute. How could anyone say no to purchasing this song? I feel it is the very least thing I could do.  My heart has broken a million times over this. I hope this helps with the healing process both for the people of Sandy Hook and myself as well.
1	This is inspiring
1	just listen and enjoy such staggering musicianship. this recording is of the band playing powerful chamber music.  powerful and beautiful compositions and improvisations.
1	I like much of Kylie's work, but am not really a fan of the original version of Breathe.  This is a great remix.
1	Very sultry, sexy tune...more so than Marvin Gaye's Sexual Healing !!!!
1	For a free download song from amazon, this is a good song. Background arrangement is good and man's voice is good too.
1	One of the most under-rated albums ever made. It's unfortunate that this passed most people by. I highly recommend this CD for music fans. At the time Danny Elfman wrote most of these songs, he said that noticed his teenage daughters were listening to a lot of Beatles and Led Zeppelin which caused him to rediscover an appreciation for that music.  You can hear the influence in the song writing on "Boingo". This is almost the highest level of song writing that Boingo achieved. It's not my favorite Boingo CD, but it is one of my favorite works of music.  It begins with Insanity, a grand orchestral piece about the frustration of living in what is perceived to be a "Christian" society. The third song "Mary" is very Beatles-esque. It's a beautiful song that I was shocked never made it onto the radio. "Can't See - Useless" makes me cry every time I hear it. It's a song about a failing relationship. "Lost Like This" is very much like old, early eighties Boingo. "War" is a great protest song, written at the time of the Gulf War. "Change" is a 10 minute wonderful and fulfilling jam.  There are only a few weak points on this CD. First, I'm not too fond of "Pedestrian Wolves". I find the song to be a little too long and not that great to listen to. The other problem is the lack of "Helpless". This song was a bonus track on the cassette tape of "Boingo", but could have easily fit on the CD. I have no idea why they've left it off.  These are minor draw backs. The CD is great. They spent a lot of time on it. They titled it "Boingo" because it was a complete departure from "Oingo Boingo". They practically dropped the horn section, and added the guitarist of the Vandals to get a more rock sound going on this CD. The songs are long and musically well thought out (Danny Elfman is a composer, after all). Even if you don't like the traditional O-B sound, I think that any person would be very pleasantly surprised by this CD. Now what are you waiting for? Order it already!
1	The songs are really awesome but short,  still worth it though as the songs are hilarious and have great beats
1	I was told about this fine album by a friend. Mr & Mrs Kochis have been singing Christian service music for several years.  This album, more than an hour, includes some of my favorites, such as "One Bread, One Body", "How Great Thou Art", "Blest Are They", "Be Not Afraid" and more. They each have good range and pleasant classical/pop voices, displayed singly and together through deliberate, thoughtful tempos. The arrangements basically correspond to what you might hear at a service with a "Contemporary Choir" - some additional voices, some short, understated instrumental solos that enhance the peaceful, reflective nature of the hymns. This didn't quite have the impact for me that actually singing and playing the hymns myself sometimes does, but these are  good, solid performances. This would be excellent for relaxation and contemplation. It would also be good, peaceful background music while doing office or home tasks. The Kochis' sing songs that help the faithful listener feel the love of God. I did, and you could, too.
1	This is a good song.  The download was fast and there were no issues in the quality for this product.
1	Love Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe and the everlys youll love this tune
1	The first time I've heard about Carol Riddick was on the booklet from the classic "Who's Jill Scott?" where Ms. Scott encouraged her to SING. I got a big nice surprise when I heard her sharing the microphone with Musiq Soulchild on that AMAZING track titled "Best Friend"  Since then, I have been looking for Ms. Riddick collaborations (check out "Float" where she provides backing vocals for Anthony Hamilton) and bought the album "Moments Like This" from iTunes.  It is like a summer breeze, Carol Riddick's voice caress your ears and takes you to another dimension. I do really recommend you to get this album, as I already had a digital copy, but I really needed to listen to her music on a proper cd player!!  Looking forward to new stuff from Ms. Riddick!
1	I am a fan of Josh Groban and this CD has all the elements needed to be successful.
1	I'd never heard of Jimmy Webb before Amazon offered it in their $5 sale. After listening to the samples I decided to give it a try. I really like Jimmy Webb's sound, and love the duets with other singers that are on this album. Currently this is my go-to album when I want easy, calm music.
1	Look I would much rather review a recording of say Chopin's third piano sonata than a hit from the sixties which may not stand the test of time as well as Chopin, Mozart, or J.S. Bach has. But I happen  to have married my love on 28 December 1963 - and "Oh What a Night" is a constant reminder, if indeed I ever needed one, that I am the luckiest man on Earth. Now if you and your bride were also of this same vintage year I suggest you make it your song as it has become for Elaine and me. And remember the original is by Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons - no other version will suffice. It's a great period piece and one which I believe will stand the test of time.
1	love it
1	All songs you know with Woody joining forces with some great female vocalists.  Sometimes, to me Willie Nelson's songs can sometimes be so laid back that you could go to sleep but not these.  All great, timeless songs with Willie matched perfectly in duets with some of my favorite female singers.  If you like Willie at all and want to hear him sing along with the likes of Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood, Sheryl Crow, et. al. , I highly recommend this album.
1	I like the song
1	Awesome song! Love how Daft Punk is trying to revolutionize the 70's. It sounds like the rest of this CD is going to be awesome too. Go Pre-order it NOW!
1	great song,great lyrics. a reminder that our home is with the glory of God
1	Love love love
1	Timeless classic song with a good message.
1	This is a hard core Blue October Song that I love! Justin and the band never fail to make words move you.
1	I can't find this album anywhere but here you at least get V0 quality. Hoping for a physical copy one day. Seems like a decent album so far (If you like Hail the Villain, which you should)
1	A wonderful Singing Voice as well as music and tells the truth in his song
1	Great alternative version.
1	This superb CD by a band composed of studio musicians is my choice when I want to put a music system to a test. And the music chosen is great too. The tracks I especially like are the Kenton medely and the Phantom of the Opera medley. A real pro did the arrangements. This CD has wonderful fidelity. I bought two copies so I could carry one around to different hifi stores to try our their systems.
1	A song has to have the right lyrics, the right vocals, and the right beat for me---and this one is just awesome.  The part about mercy pressed against the veil is as deeply theological as it gets and I think it is POWERFUL!  My absolute favorite.
1	My favorite Kid Rock to date.
1	Awesome best yet
1	Even though this is a older song, it still is pretty great.  I love it & I am always trying to get everyone to open their minds and listen to it.  I want them to be able to see the beauty of this song as well as the talent of the singer.  I truly hope as many people as possible will have a chance to hear this song at least once in their life time.  I believe that if they are given that opportunity then they will want to hear it a lot more than just the one time.
1	Kelli gives this christmas favorite a cute kick!! Kelli Pickler is too cute and she gives this song that extra something.
1	This song offers a much needed reminder to every Christian.
1	Foot stomping, picks me up
1	Great mixture of upbeat and soulful--and anything with David Arkenstone catches my eye. Love it. Nice for anyone who liked the Brave soundtrack.
1	Greatest band ever!!!  If you are looking for a way to get your young teen or young adult friends hooked on Christian music look no further!!  NeedtoBreath!!
1	I probably have 8 or 9 Mills Brothers albums, and yet "My Wild Irish Rose" wasn't on any of them. So I bought the MP3 version, and their old harmonizing is there in all it's melodious glory. It's an "earlier" recording, but it's certainly worth 99.
1	Good band good cd unique cover. No complaints
1	I love this type of music and it was very enjoyable.  It was wonderful to find music of this type for my Kindle so that I can have it handy whenever I want to listen to it.
1	Great song.
1	love usher and love the hook to this song
1	Florida Georgia Line did a great job on this cd and could easily cross over to rock!! I will definitely buy their next cd.
1	Always stirs me up inside. This song will never get old. Its a great song to add to an easy listening, slow grove or lovers type playlist.
1	My husband loves it!
1	With Love From a Chorus features the male voices of the Robert Shaw Chorale singing a well chosen selection of traditional Barber Shop melodies.  Selections include Aura Lee, Seeing Nellie home, My Grandfather's Clock and numerous others.  I last heard this record in 1959 and my memories of it are as vivid as if it was yesterday. I live in hope that some day it will be digitally remastered and released on CD and am confident that it would command steady and continuing sales because this is music that speaks to the heart not just of America but of all who value good songs beautifully performed.
1	Love this so much. I'm so happy it was on here!
1	I love Metric.  I've listened to their previous albums on repeat for years.  And I like Pagans in Vegas very much.  However, it's a little more complicated listen than some of their previous work.  There are some songs on the album that are instant favorites; obviously The Shade, and also Fortune, For Kicks, and Too Bad So Sad.  Blind Valentine, the two The Face songs, and Lie, Lie, Lie are a little harder for me to get into--they're just not as catchy and have a rhythm that feels a little jarring.  I have a feeling they will grow on me with time, but they just deffer from what I expect from Metric.  So maybe it's a case of me being too narrow in my taste or letting my expectations keep me from appreciating something worthy.  I'm giving the album a 4, but I totally recommend getting it and trying a very good album.  Frankly, even with the shaken up expectations, Pagans is still one of the best albums I've heard released in 2015.
1	I believe Nirvana was one of the greatest bands of all time. Some may say Kurt wasn't a good guitar player or whatnot, but listen to the lyrics of this album and try to figure out exactly what they mean. It's in the lyrics and how they're delivered were Smells Like Teen Spirit starts to shine, Kurt is an amazing composer and vocalist who left before his time, take a moment to listen to any of the songs on this album, I think they're all good especially lithium, which is personally my favorite song of all time. As long as your a fan of good music this cd is definetly worth buying.
1	<3 OMGOGNIOENTE It came yesterday and I was so happy~~ Inside there was the album thing+photobook (I didn't open it yet), photocards, and a poster ^-^ and it was nicely packaged with lots and lots of bubble wrap which I enjoyed popping. TY SO MUCH <3 It came in a week ^^ and there were also treats packaged cutely 
1	The song has a nice hook to it. It is an older song from several years ago. But I still love it.
1	Great
1	Misssissippi at its finest
1	Excellent!
1	For those wanting a list of episodes included:  Series 5, #7 "Lurgi Strikes Britain" Series 6, #9 "The International Christmas Pudding" Series 6, #4 "Napoleon's Piano" Series 7, #12 "The Flea"  I have all of these in my collection; all of these are funny, but my favorite is "Napoleon's Piano"
1	I just love George Strait's music. His voice is absolutely gorgeous. He's always able to deliver the perfect lyrics Texas style
1	great beat uplifting music. I enjoy being able to listen to it on my kindle anytime I want. Its a great song
1	really enjoyed this rendering
1	Great song, easy download to my MP3 and I now can listen to the song every where I go. Thanks
1	Beautiful, haunting and takes me back in time. Ani Williams is the best when it comes to doing her version of Egyptian music. Her music just feels right
1	Excellent song
1	Easy way to buy only the songs I want
1	Both my parents and grandparents have this album and I just recently inherited my grandparents copy.  Over the years I have come to appreciate the great jazz cuts on this album.  It's great to know that this music never dies.
1	My favorite song for a while there. I still love it.
1	CANNOT RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM Danny Boyz- my cd is overdue 7 days, have emailed twice and gotten no response! This is a wonderful cd by an annoited worship leader. Have enjoyed EVERYTHING I hear from Tommy Walker. Highly recommend his works just mot from this shipper.
1	Amazing! No two songs are alike. A few curse words but my whole family can rock out to it.
1	Love  this.
1	LOVEBTHIS MUSICAL!!! The music is amazing! The packaging was great.
1	I saw this on Youtube and fell in love this symphony. One of the most amazing pieces of music. Leonard Bernstein really makes this piece pop. I can't stop listening to it.
1	The music on this album is classic jazz standards and were show cased in a television series here in Australia some years ago called Come In Spinner.  Both artists on this album Vince Jones and Grace Knight are superb.  It is a truly delightful experience and I can recommend this if you like good music sung beautifuly.
1	Such a beautiful final album from Chris Cornell. The vinyl sounds amazing .
1	Brilliant lyrics! I originally heard it as a B-side, but loved it as much as the A-side.
1	loved this cd!
1	They have come out with some great hits and this is one of them.  Really like the cello in the beginning
1	good
1	Need Sleep ?  Relaxation ?  This is IT.  The bubbling sounds of water are perfect.
1	Lovely Song!
1	Years before this album, Percy Faith was one of the true kings of instrumental pop music, especially with his Latin-flavored signature style, and admirers of his most classic works are likely to put off by this album just by seeing "disco" and "Percy Faith" in the same sentence (anybody remember Pat Boone and his heavy metal)?  Truth be told, nothing on this album (which was made just a year before Faith's death) is as richly beautiful as "Theme From A Summer Place" or "Delicado," but anyone who thinks that it's an album full of generic dance music made to cash in on the disco craze will be surprised. There is no singing, and all of the songs are solid, well-arranged, and have that rich, orchestral aura to them that Percy Faith is best known for.
1	This collaboration always produces musical goodness.  Can't wait for the new albums from both.
1	I am a new Tegan and Sara fan and I absolutely love this album. It's so amazing. Everyone should by it.
1	Love Mandisa.
1	Awesome song for an awesome movie
1	Love it!!
1	I have loved this song since it came out...
1	This song just gets me pumped with the full awesomeness of the 80's. I was born in 85 so this kind of music just passed me by until my early 20's, it was then I fell to me knees and shouted to the heavens "What have I done with my life?!!"  I still haven't fully recovered from the earth shattering epiphany I had that day, i was born in the wrong decade. All I know now is this song is awesome and she said, any way you want it that's the way you need it any way you want it.
1	Grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled times it's no suprise. But she finally catches on that there is God who is flow of enduring love. The theme song deputies this in a haunting way.
1	This is very nice indie music album. I liked all the songs, Lights are easy to use and made my day;)
1	Love this song!
1	When I first listened to the CD of The Doors live at the Felt Forum, New York City 1970 I was dumbfounded by the clarity of the soundboard recording and more so by the Doors feral performance. This was in 1989 and the box set was imported from Europe and included many photos both in B/W and Color of those Felt Forum Concerts. It also included  Jim Morrison quotes from those performances. So it is quite enlightening to have a chance to listen to a clearer version of the same recordings 21 years later with more liner notes and the sonic clarity that only Bruce Botnik, original Doors engineer, could personally accomplish. These live Doors recordings include the bands effort to capture their early 1966-1967 club day intimacy. Songs like Peace Frog, Soul Kitchen, Who Do You Love, Moonlight drive, Light my Fire, Maggie M'Gill, are easy standouts not because of their familiarity but because the band attempts and succeeds a looser, more jazzier approach to their arrangements without compromising the ferocity of the performance. The music sounds fresher than previous Door concert recordings like Live in Houston (1968) or Live at Madison Square Garden (1969). True, the band knew they were recording these Felt Forum concerts but they were also not showboating or posturing because you can't fake the funk on a live audio recording.  I suggest anyone interested in the Doors music try and give Live at the Felt Forum a listen. It is an amazing recording that should have been released not in 1989 or 1979 but when it was originally recorded. This box set is the missing link that "Absolutely Live" was not absolute about!
1	I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.g. "I must find some kind persona grata, to give me data, personally").  For that reason, I think I prefer Rosemary Clooney's recording of the song.
1	Never thought that I'd hear from Paul Simon again. Nice tunes, esoteric, funky, and with some really different instruments that blend well in the background of the main chordal structures.
1	This is one of the best clarinet CDs I own. The repertoire selection is varied, and also very entertaining! This isn't pure highbrow art music, much of it is simply fun to listen to. Within a few seconds of listening, you'll realize that you're in the hands of a master. Haskell's technique is flawless, her tone is consistently gorgeous, and her artistic flourishes are tasteful and impeccable. Seriously, get this and get (clarinet) enchanted.
1	Rachmaninov was best known as a pianist, but he composed three symphonies.  Symphony No. 2, the best known, was written in 1906-07 and first performed under the composer's direction in 1908.  In this symphony, as in much of his oeuvre, Rachmaninov was greatly influenced by the music of Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, and the symphony reflects 19th Century romanticism and sentimentality.  Rachmaninov once said that he was unable to compose in the atonal style that came to dominate the 20th Century.  The symphony opens with a long slow introduction based on a lugubrious theme.  This theme returns several times in the course of the symphony as a motto theme, similar to those of Tchaikovsky's 4th and 5th symphonies. The following exposition is repeated in this recording, and the development features a return to the mood of the introduction. The second movement is a lively scherzo, with an even faster middle section that is actually a speeded up version of the scherzo opening.  The third movement adagio features one of Rachmaninov's most gorgeous melodies, played by the clarinet.  The music reaches a grand climax in the middle section before a reprieve of the opening.  The lively finale starts with a modified version of the scherzo theme in the major mode, followed by several interludes that refer back to other themes of the preceding movements.  At the end, the motto theme of the symphony is heard as a chorale in the major, followed by a flurry of fireworks that bring the symphony to an end.  This symphony features lush, romantic melodies throughout, and the Royal Philharmonic under the direction of Vernon Handley, aided by wonderfully rich sound quality, brings out the symphony's lyricism in this fine recording.  The tempos are somewhat restrained here; I've heard more dramatic performances, but this one is tops for its lyrical qualities.  The recording was made in 1997 and has been remastered for improved sound, with very impressive results.  I highly recommend this recording of this wonderful symphony.  One note: Amazon lists this recording as being available as an MP3 download, but only the second (scherzo) movement is available to download.  However, the entire symphony is available on CD as part of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's Audiophile Collection.
1	I am not a musician, much less a clarinet player, and I only know what I like. Listening to the performance of Richard Stoltzman and Richard Goode of these mellow, genially melancholy sonatas, my only thought was how lovely they were, and how in my opinion they did full justice to the autumnal beauty of late Brahms. Therefore looking at the Amazon reviews for this disk, I was shocked to see how many reviewers seem to have it in for Stoltzman. (Question: Why has John Marco been allowed to post two copies of the same review for the past seven years?) I admit I am not competent to compare and contrast Stoltzman's recording of the Brahms sonatas with those of other clarinetists. I only know that, as a casual but ardent fan of classical music, I found this disk wholly satisfactory.
1	what a beautiful voice!
1	EXCELLENT
1	I love love love to drive my corvette to this tune!! It is the best! She is so talented, love her.
1	Awesome, soulful doing
1	A great song of praise and worship!
1	Classic soundtrack of a classic movie.
1	When I first heard about Mitch Hedberg, I thought he was one of the funniest, most original comedians out there.  His delivery and his random observations make him someone so unique that there has never been anyone like him.  I was sad to hear that he passed away before I even got to see him live, but his memory will live on through his albums.  He had two albums released before his death (Mitch All Together and Strategic Grill Locations) both of which I believe are more polished than this one.  But knowing that I'd never be able to hear him perform fresh material makes me love this new album.  I highly recommend this album if you're a fan of Mitch Hedberg.  If you haven't heard any of his stuff yet, check out the other two albums first because they are much longer.  Mitch All Together has 2 discs (1 CD and 1 DVD) while this one is only 39 minutes of audio.
1	Catchy!
1	Great cover 
1	Oh my, my first love! What more do I need say and Rene and Angela say it so well. As a retired DJ I have to say from the time this song was released, it was one of the most requested especially for weddings. This is one that young as well as us older crowd alike enjoy this well composed song. It's definitely a 5 star.
1	Extremely Pleased!  I heard a song recently that caught my attention so I looked it up with "Sound Hound".  I decided to check out the band to see what else they had to offer.  After listening to all of the samples on the album, I wanted more.  I love the gritty bluesy sound in the majority of the tracks.  The vocals are great as well.  The foreign track they recorded is just beautiful.  I assume it's icelandic since thats where they're from.  You don't have to understand what they are saying to appreciate it.  If you enjoy bluesy-rock with a lot of heart- you will love these guys.  I would definitely recommend these tunes.  I'm looking forward to seeing what they offer as a follow-up.
1	Great one! Love this song.
1	Only good song they ever had.
1	I lov this song
1	Another great tune produced by Train!
1	Beautiful, Romantic, passionate songs.  Working out, house cleaning and everyday mundane things appear more beautiful when listening to this song in English and Spanish.
1	Ed Ames isn't a name that is heard mentioned much, but his music was pure gold, this song is one of those songs to tug at your heart strings.
1	I would like to say hated it as it is on constant repeat in my car but my daughters love it so there you have it.
1	If you like "Over You" by Daughtry then you can probably appreciate this song as well. Great ballad!
1	I love Ronnie Radke. Heavy, heart-felt, and overall real.  You have to listen to this album.  Falling in Reverse are the perfect answer for those of you looking for that indefinable conglomerate of musical genres. Ronnie or crew...if you see this, i would love a free t-shirt.
1	Surprised with the quality and number of tracks, 20.  There are only two tracks that I skip when playing.  Especially like Pavarotti and Sutherland!  Truly got my money's worth . . . and more.
1	These songs get me through my work day and whenever I am working out.  My son like them, too; he's 9
1	i love this song! it didn't get much radio play but the video was on all the time. i wish this album had been promoted more/better because NE is still HOT!
1	I like it
1	I love it: I brought it to listen to at home but now I loaded it on phone and listen it all the time. I would recommend this to all christian music lovers.
1	AWESOME
1	I bought this disc shortly after it's release in the early 90s. It became a favorite but kind of became forgotten over the next 20 years. Then one night I was looking up to the sky and there was Orion directly over me. The song played in my head and I had to have it!
1	Love this song!
1	I was lucky enough to find this album brand new a few months ago.  All I have to say is WOW.  I am a huge ICON fan and have the other three.  I would rate this as good as Right Between the Eyes, which was always my favorite.  Jerry's vocals are amazing, and the music and songwriting are superb.  I like all of the tracks really, but In Your Eyes, One Step Behind, Forever Young, Left To Be Alone, Strong Love, Sweet Young Sinner and Gold Bullets are my favorites.  Pick up a copy if you see it.  You won't be disappointed!
1	nice
1	This is very pleasant to listen to. I highly recommend it for anyone who  to relax and get away from their mind thoughts
1	Love music
1	Amazing voice
1	Wow she can really dance. Just hearing this song, make me forget my problem four the moment is so cool.
1	very soothing...
1	Love this song, 1 of my favorite songs on album
1	You can use this review for all the recent music orders I made.  Enjoying my purchases very much thank again.
1	Awesome wrap up to their studio career.
1	Awesome!!! Best song ever written this year. Not just a bunch of noise
1	I was lucky enough to track down a DVD copy of this--took years. But, it was worth the long and arduous search. This band is dreamy, surfy, fun, original, and talented. All instrumental, no distracting vocals. Produced 1999 out of Santa Barbara. The spirit of surf still emanates from SoCal! Of special mention on this album is the song 'Mother Ship'. Multi-layered, sly, utterly engaging to the ears and brain. Interesting use of trombone and glockenspiel. Get it however you can.
1	Loved it.
1	This song is Pure harmony. I've seen them try to play this song without all of the electrical and mechanical additions, and it does NOT measure up to the original recording. They would need at least three more singers! That's what makes this song so perfect in its original recorded form. Thank God for harmonical equipment!
1	Really good CD. Some covers, some original music. I expect to hear more great music from this guy.
1	Awesome artist all his stuff is great but this is one of my favs. great beat makes me move my feet
1	The first time I saw Cocker perform was during a televised version of the Woodstock Movie. Of course I thought, oh that poor man has cerebral palsy. Um, no, just an idiosyncratic performing style. In any case, Cocker has, in my opinion, one of the greatest voices in rock--and the uncanny ability to transform other people's music -especially the Beatles' tinkely tunes into something much grittier and more infectious. I dare you to listen without starting to sway back and forth and play air guitar. Delightful and recommended.
1	Years of pumping Mozart, Beethoven and Bruckner into my offspring in transit led to a Spartacist rebellion. Nowadays on pain of death Im banned from playing DSM Dads Strange Music in earshot. Strangely enough, only Beethovens Ninth and the Emperor Concerto do not spark a wasp-like reaction. Barbarism is ascendant. At least I tried to avert it. Perhaps itll bear fruit in the future.  In some ways this is not a bad thing as I want to spare them the gnosis of Schuberts Unfinished Symphony (and for that matter, the Tchaik 6th as played by Herbie & BP on EMI from 1971). D 759 is a one-way excursion to the Underworld. Whenever I listen to it, I feel like lying down and placing a penny on eye for the benefit of Mister Kite and his buddy Charon. The title of Hopkins study on the Doors  No-one gets out of Here Alive  could just as easily be appropriated by D 759. Astronomers who postulate the existence of Dark Matter but cannot locate it in the cosmos would be well-advised to buy a copy of its score. Only the Bruckner 9th, I suggest, is more plutonic in pith.  Avoid this version of Herbies Unfinished from the mid-Seventies. It features the first movement that was thought to be lost in a studio mix-up. Herbie then underwent spinal surgery  yuk  and eventually returned to the Philharmonie to re-record it. Decades later, the original take was discovered and issued as part of the Karajan Edition from 1996. Its not a patch on the remake as if Herbie had looked into the abyss (no, not the bunker) and it had returned his stare with interest. It is easy to tell them apart. The original lasts for 1225. The (superior) remake runs for 1156. The development in the first movement of the latter scares the bejesus out of Satan himself  thats no mean achievement. To find the remake, exhume the old EMI Studio remaster from the Eighties, or better still, lash out on the Warner Box where wisdom prevailed in its selection over the original.  Here, the original is coupled with Herbies fourth and best account of D944 where, as he confided, he stopped trying to over-ratiocinate and gave the Berliners full rein Its superb. The banks of four-chords in the finale are a barbaric yamp across the rooftops and spires of the world.   Five Stars for D 944, and an admonition re D 759: seek if you must.
1	Love this song, just wanted it on a different platform. Down loaded immediately.
1	Some good, some great, some OK!
1	Love this song!
1	Its a hot and sexy song for grown folks
1	Golden oldie!
1	Great classic
1	Love the music, but the lyrics are beyond inspiration!!!!
1	Backstreet boys were huge when I was a teenager and I love that I can still get their music. I catch a lot of flak for still listening to them but I don't care, they made catchy tunes.
1	Heard this when my nephew posted it in Facebook and liked it.  Bought it so I can listen to it on my portable.
1	Yeah, Chicago is great... I always make fun of band directors by quoting them as saying "SURE, I LOVE Jazz... Chicago is my favorite band." But this is a neat direction for them.  I actually bought this record as a joke, just to see how bad it would be, with Rascall Flatts producing Chicago?!  Country slickness meets sophistication?  What?  It's a great fit... The tunes are very strong... lyric cliches abound, but so does great melody and fun chords.  Excellent singing, vocal arrangments (Jay McManus influence tightens them up, I think); the horn arrangements command your attention, always that high trombone sound cutting thru the mix.  GREAT drumming and DRUM SOUND... I love how dry everything is, how you can hear every little detail of these arrangements...  Anyway, who knew they had it in them?  I quite dig this record and urge others to give it a try.  I kinda wish they'd make up with Cetera and include him in the fun again...  all the other bands are doing it, in their waning years... they don't have to can Jason Scheff, either.
1	Saw an episode of Handel on tv and thought hmmm I would like to listen to him. Great to listen to
1	Great beat brings you back in time
1	Great comeback song for Michael English. So great to see his life has turned around by God's grace and forgiveness.
1	Ray never fails to deliver!!! Another spectacular album from one of country music's countriest artists!!!
1	Anything that this man has ever sang was a hit. I wish I owned every song he ever sang. Even his movie would be great to own. Really though I love listening to gospel as much as a love old country.
1	I absolutely love....love....love this cassette tape, so much that I wish I could find it in cd format or figure out who the artists are so I can purchase songs individually on Itunes....the music is so relaxing and beautifully played on the piano.  My favorite Christmas music of all time!!
1	Celtic thunder is such a "Refreshing" group ! They are clean cut, handsome & have fantastic voices ! This album is great as all of their albums are. I would highly recommend it !
1	I've been a fan of Lori's music for several years, and "Lorraine" is a welcome rebound from the good, but Nashville-slick "Unglamorous." The biggest change here is the inclusion of several piano-based songs, which are the early standouts on an album full of excellent tunes. "If He Tried" is one of them, and the best is album closer "Still Down Here", one of the finest songs she's ever done.  Too early to tell whether "Lorraine" is as good as the brilliant "Bittertown", but that's a tough album to top, and second place in Lori's gem of a catalog is still a great spot to be in.
1	Very entertaining
1	OK
1	As a Christian, I'm always looking for music that exalts my Father. This is a good song for that purpose. Easy to follow lyrics and music make this a song that memorizes well.
1	I love this song I have a side to me that is not always seen, but this song is me in so many ways and probably a few other wemen I might add! You go girl rock I love all of your music fits my personality!!
1	Love it.
1	I only bought the title track of the CD, since I was specifically after a Thanksgiving song.  The sentiments in the song are simple, yet they are that kind of simple which is simultaneously rich.  I've played this for some classes I work with, and found some teary-eyed kids and teachers when it was over.  It's a winner.
1	Great Album!!
1	when times feel like revenge is the answer , listen to this song , God bless all of my BBBIIIIGGGGG family in Jesus Christ  God is GOOOOD
1	saw this video in the early days of mtv. sounds really good came from australia like ac/dc did. shame they didn't achieve the success like ac/dc did. really good song
1	I bought this single after losing my double CD a decade or so ago; my favorite song from the album.  It'll bring back memories of your angsty junior high and high school days, and all of you young kids can love this song and knowingly tell your friends about how hip you are because you listen to it.
1	Have always liked this song but have never added it to my library until I say the David Foster "Hits" Concert & she made an appearance and brought the house down. Great addition if ou don't already own it
1	A decade later, I'm still missing you  ~butterfly kisses memories~ I hope you're up there smiling down  I wonder if you'd be proud of me. I never could dance very well,   But you taught me to make my own beat And now I dare to dance to a different tune  To a song known only to you and me. Piano rifts, jazz fingers ablaze  I can still hear your melody and even though you're not around   Your song forever lives in me.
1	Love listing to her.
1	Ahhhhh I love this song!!!
1	If you don't like Harry Belafonte you need to take medication.  :)
1	Wow. Some seriously amazing stuff on this album.
1	Love this song.
1	I had this record of this back in the eighties, and loved it at the time for being such a glorious work of weirdness.  I recently scored the disc in a second hand shop and listened again for the first time in more than two decades.  It's lost none of its charm.  In fact, I think I like it even better now.  The Campers always tempered their avant-garde tendencies with their inherent pop smarts, one of the reasons their albums were always as listenable as they were fun.  But here, in the company of the great Eugene Chadbourne, they let the strangeness fly.  The result is an album that, in its most sedate parts, is completely off kilter, and at other times runs totally off the rails and crashes into some genuinely fascinating territory as a result.  Definitely not for casual Camper fans or the easy listening crowd, but if you enjoy Sun Ra, Zappa, John Zorn, and other experimental artists, you truly need this album.
1	I've been listening to Kid Rock for years, I think my tastes in music have slowing changed over the years, as has Kid Rocks music.  This has amazing songs beginning to end, not a bad single on the entire album.
1	I've listened to it as much as i listened to the Dixie Chick's "Fly" album when it was first released.
1	I happen to like this CD because it was a hit back in 1993. The CD was very good and catchy. Song list: 1. Mtame de Amor 2. Besito en la Boquita 3. El Negro no Puede 4. Maria Isabel 5. Crcel sin Rejas 6. La Condena 7. Sirva ms Cerveza 8. Aguarientosky
1	Great song
1	I like this song when I need a little more pep in my step.
1	This song was the 1st Train song I ever heard. Has a great beat and I also listen to it while exercising and swimming laps in the pool.
1	Love this song one of his greatest yet
1	Love the cover of this one and of course the songs
1	I love this song!
1	I love the CD, seems like Jay really worked hard and everyone sounds GREAT!!! I loved hearing lil Sky on there also :) Faith
1	I first heard of Amy Stroup while scouring the internet for wedding songs. "Just You" was the song I chose to walk down the aisle to, and I've had SO many compliments. Guests still ask me about the song. After our wedding, I purchased some of her music - love it all.
1	Very good song! Well done.
1	When I was a child and young man, I was found two songs from this show very heartening. The first is 'You'll Never Walk Alone.' The short staircase in our house was somewhat dark, and I used to be afraid of the dark. So when I was going up to bed, my mother used to sing 'You'll Never Walk Alone', and that made me less scared. The second is 'You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan'. As an only child, I often felt lonely and strange. This song always cheered me up. When I got older, I was amused by Hammerstein's play on the word 'queer'. The rest of the songs are, of course, fabulous. I love to sing them in the shower, or hum them on the way to the gym. (I also recommend 'South Pacific' for when you want 'to wash that man right outa [your] hair'.)
1	Good
1	I am in love with this :).
1	<3 Dean!! and I like this song any time of the year!!
1	Great tune.....Love it!
1	Great seller. Thank you!  5 stars is for the seller. This band sucks. Don't ever buy this crap. EVER! I bought for a friend, which I am now rethinking.
1	Excellent CD!! Their best since the 90's classic "Bloody Kisses" and well worth the wait! I only hope their next release will be out soon since this CD makes you want more new music. The bonus "Live" CD was classic as well making the 2-CD set a bargain for the $11.99 price.
1	I heard this song in a movie I think. It moved me enough to find this single. If you are blessed/lucky to have a wife like mine then this song should touch your heart.
1	Awesomely wonderful!
1	Adele, enough said!
1	Good Stuff
1	There are several EXCELLENT tracks on here. There are also a bunch of Joe's usual meandering and experimentation. If you're a Satriani fan, you'll find the latter interesting and fun. There are some tracks that hearken all the way back to "Flying in a Blue Dream", and sound like they came straight out of the 80's which is a fun throwback. The title track, as well as "Crazy Joe", are real standouts. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. Amazon as usual gets 5 stars - not only did it show up quickly but I got the MP3's within about 30 seconds of ordering.
1	Hace un a&ntilde;o sufr&iacute; la muerte de un hermano que siempre fue un gran fan&aacute;tico de Rub&eacute;n y que me introdujo en el fant&aacute;stico mundo de su m&uacute;sica. Nunca pens&eacute; que ser&iacute;a posible para Rub&eacute;n componer algo m&aacute;s inspirado y profundo  que las canciones de "Amor y Control", especialmente los cantos  alrededor de la muerte de su madre, y las cuales llevo grabadas en la mente  y el coraz&oacute;n desde la muerte de la m&iacute;a en el '94.  Sin embargo, TIEMPOS  presenta un nivel de creatividad e inspiraci&oacute;n similar o mayor que aquel.  Hay en &eacute;l nuevos ritmos y sonoridades (mar del sur, viento y madera),  mensajes sociales (sicarios -los reto&ntilde;os de Pedro Navaja-, 20 de diciembre)  e introspectivos (vida), adem&aacute;s de fuertes elementos de un amor extinguido  que me arrancan l&aacute;grimas al pensar en la familia de mi hermano (d&iacute;a a d&iacute;a,  t&uacute; y mi ciudad).  Finalmente, tambi&eacute;n estoy maravillado por la inclusi&oacute;n de  m&uacute;sicos costarricenses (Editus y Jazz Latino) que le aportaron una nueva  dimensi&oacute;n a esta obra maestra, y agradecido con vos Rub&eacute;n por deleitarnos  con tu siempre excelente m&uacute;sica (y por el fant&aacute;stico concierto que dieron  en Costa Rica...Erick desde el cielo no dej&oacute; de bailar! ). No dejen de  tenerlo en su colecci&oacute;n y no se pierdan su concierto si tienen la  oportunidad...
1	Its been forever since i fell in love with an album , whatever happened to great music ??? But here it is finally !! Love Amy Winehouse, she has the most unique voice and love every single song. Her words are raw and edgy but very real. No more Barbies singing silly songs ...
1	This is an amazing song.  It's dark and rich and truly unique.  The first time I listened to it, I thought "Uh....this is kinda weird...." but as I listened to it I began to really get it and now I love it!  Any song that can expand your musical boundaries like that is pure genius.
1	used for a class
1	I heard someone else sing the song at a party. I remembered hearing the song years ago and i had to have it. Very nice song.
1	Bad a$$ song, a must have.
1	Some of the songs are great, but there are a few that perhaps aren't quite his type of songs to sing. We are such fans though, for so many years, that we still enjoy it.
1	Excellent song, one of my favorites. The first time I heard it, I immediately knew it'd be a good song (for me). It's fairly catchly I guess. I like the background beat. There's not much to write about a song, but one word can sum it up. Excellent.
1	OK, I don't understand a word in any Scandinavian language, but it isn't too difficult to guess the theme of the songs on the X-mas albumm, is it?. Korberg's rendition of carols, both popular in English (like Silent night) and those I never heard before is warm, soulful and thoroughly enjoyable.
1	It's like listening to Linken Park  - proves Christian music is just as good as any other out there.
1	Its sad that these ladies never got the respect  or fame they should have.
1	Easily their best album prior to their sound-change in the 70s, and their most challenging musically.  Released as a double-album in 1969, it's not long by today's standards (at 64 mins), but it was a radical departure.  Note that on 2 LPs, there were 4 "sides" of music, and on this album they are arranged carefully. The album opens with the 7-1/2 min title track, a hauntingly sad song with wailing discordant vocals and long instrumental passages - accoustic (classical) guitar and cello!  The next two songs fit smoothly into the mood. Side 2 throws a change of pace with the bluesy "Marley Purt Drive", then the short pieces "Edison" and "Melody Fair" (which should have been a single - they later collected it on "Best of vol 2").  "Suddenly" has an extremely interesting guitar beginning, and the side trails off with the odd jarring ending of "Whisper Whisper".  Side 3 begins with the dramatic chords of "Lamplight", then the poignant little ballad "Sound of Love".  At this point the fun relief of "Give Your Best" is very welcome.  Then the album goes right back to serious, with two "classical style" instrumentals.  I particularly like the "Seven Seas Symphony". Side 4 sneaks up on you with the quiet beginning to "I Laugh In Your Face".  The great song "First of May" is in this section; sad, like all the other "great" songs on this album.  The album ends with the orchestral piece "British Opera", which echoes (reprises) the orchestral stuff from side 3, and trails off. The album doesn't quite hang together as a "concept" album; lyrically there are odd departures (Edison?  Whisper Whisper?).  But the sound is very distinctive beginning to end, and the mood is consistently dark and brooding.  Most of all, the adventurous music-making is a hallmark all the way thru.  Every song is very interesting musically, with inventive arrangments and often surprising lyrics. It's a shame that this album broke them up, and that they didn't quite accomplish what they were trying to do.  But what they did accomplish is an absolutely terrific album.
1	great music
1	Great music
1	everything was fine.
1	My favorite version of the Ave Maria!  I particularly like that there isn't a lot of vibrato.  So happy amazon has this!
1	Mary Mary is dynamite. Their voices are angelic together, and this is the perfect combination. 'God In Me' is my ringback tone. I love this group as gospel is front and center. Buy this song, and then buy the album. You will love Mary Mary as much as I do.
1	I just watched the short film on the making of the soundtrack and as it progressed I found myself leaning in further and further toward the screen of my computer. This soundtrack is just beautiful. It makes me feel like jumping on a trampoline and making a fort. Karen O is a goddess.
1	A+
1	Any music lover must see this music. I have seen the old version and the new one where Blake Shelton sings the theme song. I love it!
1	WAY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT. I BASICALLY BOUGHT IT FOR ONE SONG HOPING THERE OTHERS WERE GOOD AND I GOT A GREAT CD WHERE I LIKE EVERY SONG! CANT WAIT TO SEE THEM LIVE!!!!
1	The New No. 2's best CD yet. Alot of creative writing here. Dhani Harrison's voice has a hint of his father's
1	This is one hell of a great song. Gaga stands up, she walks over to her piano, sits down, wearing her unique style of fabulous clothing. She starts to play the piano like the best Elton John moment, and this song comes out as if Freddie Mercury is inside her vocal chords and she is amazing. The tune, the notes she takes to places other artists don't dare to go (or can't). I am in love.  No matter is Gaga is playing it for 3 people or 30,000, she always puts her heart into every performance.
1	Love, Love, Love. Have it on repeat at work.
1	I have always liked the "joy" of the song! It is fun and easy to dance to. Everyone is always ready to form a line and boogie!
1	Song speaks for its self. I plan on buying the whole album just because of this song. Reminds me almost of Matthew west in a way. It's just awesome.
1	Great Music! Glad I can buy only the Tracks I want
1	This album has some amazing tracks and is extremely strong as a whole. I highly recommend it!
1	Loved it then and love it now. sounds great, clear without static. Has as much meaning now as it did then. Maybe more.
1	Beautiful music.  I can imagine myself flying as I listen to much of these inspirational scores of music!  One of my favorites is "Test Drive" and the other is "Romantic Flight."
1	My granddaughters, 9 and 15, came for a visit.  We played these two tapes everywhere we went.  It was so wonderful to find music we could all listen to and enjoy!
1	Love this tune!
1	Darius doesn't make music like this anymore but it was great while it lasted. Great tune - we love it!
1	Thank you! The sound of Zamfir is soul touching! This man is incredible! I listen to it at home and I take it to work to play for my seniors. It makes for relaxing and peaceful times!  Thank you Zamfir and Amazon!
1	GREAT MUSIC !
1	I've always loved this song.
1	The effects of this CD opened a whole new world of dinosaurs for young children. Combining sound effects with props intrigued young children to expand their learning of an unknown world.  Highly recommend this CD for learning and for relaxation!!
1	WITH A STRING OF HITS OF HITS THIRD EYE BLIND STILL RANKS UP THERE WITH ONE A MY FAVORITE BANDS,AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH..YOU .. YOU .. YOU  TY FOR THE GREAT MUSIC,BABYLONBRUCE
1	Kind of an Andrews Sisters quality.... I love the Gloria Gaynor rendition, but this one is fun, too. I recommend it.
1	Amazing
1	A "must have" for your music collection!
1	Couldn't have chosen two magnificent singers to sing this particular song.
1	I have always loved Johnny Gill from the very start of his career. His voice is so rich and sexy!
1	I bought this song after hearing it on a trial version of satellite radio.  Holy cow my kids can't get enough of it.  I like the story too.  Who is this guy? I think I will buy his CDs.
1	Obviously, as some of you likely release that what (would be my guess) as to what draws most fans to this Kangaroo Moon CD is the Gong connection - which of course is member Mark Robson - who appears on a couple of Magick Brothers titles along with Daevid Allen. 'Between Two Worlds' is better than I had expected. Tunes that definitely did it for me were the eight-minute well-played "Market Space", the inspiring [as well as inventive] "Cool & Calm & Bright", the astounding seven-minute Gong-like "Surfing With Dr. Morph", the ass-kicking "Olympus" and the title cut "Between Two Worlds". Personnel: Mark Robson - synthesizer, didgeridoo, piano & whistle, Jerry Bewley electric and acoustic guitars & vocals, Maurice Cernigoi - bass and Matt Ledgar - drums & percussion. Only other disc that I saw by Kangaroo Moon is 'Belongil' but unfortunately, I couldn't find it anywhere.
1	I really loved the lyrics of these songs.  They say what we all think but can't put into words.  I especially liked "Little Eyes".  What a powerful message for all of us-especially those of us who have or work with  children.  This is a CD everyone should have in their collection.
1	Liked.it very much
1	UNBELIEVABLE voice!  Awesome music!
1	Just as beautiful as always. Definitly family blue grass, southern gospel type music. You will love the down home church type feel of the music The Rochesters always bring to a church service.
1	This west coast bar band deserves a national audience.  This album is one of the best Irish collections that I have seen, with rousing renditions of Tipperary and The Wearing Of The Green being my favorites.  I happened to run accross an ad while searching the net, and ordered a couple of their disks.  Both are real howlers; pick up a copy if you can.  I would love to see this bunch in concert; I hope that they make it to the Tampa area someday.
1	What a truly fantastic album.  This album was recorded live at The Palace in Louisville, KY.  For those who haven't been there, take Allison's word for it "it's one of the most beautiful theatres in the world".  Back in the 60's this was a movie theater that was converted to a concert venue.  It's appropriate that this band play this theater, since they produce some of the most beautiful neo bluegrass sounds I have ever heard.  Buy this...you will not regret it.
1	You enjoyed "tommorow will be too long"(in fact "strange boutique"&"Love zombies"). Well, it's time for you to buy their third album,unfortunatly the last one with genious guitarist Lester Square (some people play accoustic guitar, some others play lectric guitar, and Lester Square play intelligent guitar) but be glad, one more release as good as the others 's waiting for you, rendez-vous at "Volume, contrast, brillance"...
1	Loved this song for so long,
1	I should take the few minutes to find out who wrote this amazing song!  The lyrics are awesome. I never get tired of hearing Tim Mcgaw
1	Such a beautiful Concerto played by Frederyk Chopin.
1	good song
1	Wonderful song!
1	I love this song. That's one of those that just makes your day when you listen to it. G B
1	Classic
1	This song is a banger. The whole CD was worth listening too.
1	This is one of our favorite songs, we always waited for it to come on Sirrus, now we can play it anytime.
1	Ever since I downloaded this album, I had it on rotation, in the house & in the car.  I just can't get enough of the sexy sounds on this mp3!
1	I love this song !
1	Great song. Exactly like I like it. I was getting all kinds of rocky mountain high this summer. Very nice.
1	All the songs on this CD are great.
1	MJB can do no wrong in my book. Having said that, this CD is refreshing and a nice change of pace from all the pop fare out there.  Always heartfelt and her voice is better than ever.
1	Kane Brown is the best EVER!!!!
1	I am quite partial to a bit of old school rap and Young MC, I believe, is one of the good ole boys. This album has a distinct feel and pulse to it, containing an excellent mix of smooth lyrical flow with a healthy dash of funk. In a way, I think this record was ahead of it's time with tracks like Bust a Move and Know How as righteous and cool today as they were back in the day.
1	one of my fav songs
1	In Kathleen Battle's rendition of "Sweet Low/Sweet Chariot," you hear Opera, Classical, Gospel and the Blues...all encapsulated into this story-telling highly artistic song. To the southern plantations of 200 years ago, Ms. Battle takes you. She voices the extreme suffering of the African-American slave. In the cotton fields, she places you. She sings the visceral outcries for relief from bondage. In the world of music, her version of this hymn is uniquely unforgettable...unparalleled. Her male back-up choir adds a burst of "power" to this song. Her heaven sent vocal chords are tributary. Ms. Battle lauds the men, women and children...through spiritual strength, who somehow managed to survive the brutality of the ungodly institution of American Slavery.
1	This re-release is proof that JoCo has some class. I, however, don't. So I'm free to say Fox can eat a bag of dicks.
1	I have had this cd for a number of years. I still love it. bought another one to send to my sister. oh yeah I got to see him in concert at the gorge at  George WA. most excellent!
1	Music on this album clearly resembles music of Muse's first recordings.  Gripping! Exciting! Storytelling.  Love it.
1	I loved the fact I can download straight to the computer.. Awesomeness and really fast service. I will keep this seller in mind when I need more music for weddings and such.
1	excellent reggae, good beat, good rasta singing, ja man , gives me a mellow buzz just listening. light one today
1	Awesome guitarist and Awesome song...
1	Been in constant rotation since I got it!
1	Excellent music.  The tunes rank with some of the best they have done and lyrics that are more political than usual.
1	this is my most favourite album...  (though miles davis' kind of blue, U2's war, bruce cockburn's the charity of night and sam phillips' cruel inventions are close...) the quieter songs evoke a magical atmosphere...  their poetry and power reflect a very warm and gentle understanding of the  human condition...  yet the brokenness is embraced by hope, mystery and  miracle... the guitar sings in billy's hands most exquisitely...  he  dances and soars so freely on the guitar strings that one is reminded of  the perfect phrasing of ella fitzgerald, louis armstrong and miles davis... the upbeat songs have energy, humour and an understated  thoughtfulness...  and they are fun to listen to... the album is best  listened to at night...  but i love driving to this album, day or night... thank you, billy, for a beautiful, moving masterpiece that is most  wonderfully alive...
1	This is a magnificent piece by Wislocki.  I am going to try and buy the cd.
1	You should read Stephen Wilkes review first:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Here-to-There/dp/B002E2NHGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Here to There</a>  OK? I'll just add, "Me too." A very good album. I own it on vinyl, probably since sometime in the 70's.  "Man in the Big Hat" is the most memorable song on the album. It reads differently now than in 1969. Cave Creek, Arizona is now a suburb of Scottsdale, and Harold's Cave Creek Corral is now a BIG dance club for weekend wannabes from the Valley. Progress has marched on.  There really aren't any weak tracks here, and I like both voices and music. Quiet ballads, mostly. Recommended.  Happy listening-- Peter D. Tillman
1	Great song
1	Heard Wide Eyes on Sirius and bought this on the strength of that - wasn't disappointed. Great album with some immediate favourites (Airplanes, Cubism Dreams) and some growers (Shape Shifter, Who Knows Who Cares, Stranger Things). A definite buy - my favourite purchase for some time.
1	This cd is really good as is Billy's first one. I think that Billy will have a long career. He does a great job on the Kenny Rogers cover of "Lucille" and I love the 2nd track. It has a great beat to it. The title track is among my faves! It's a definite must have.
1	I knew what I wanted and I went for it. Thanks for offering it. "As We Lay" is my favorite for various reason, but this is more uptempo. I love her voice.
1	great cd by one of the top bands around today...
1	I was looking for music for a project and came across this instrumental. It was not appropriate for my current project, but I liked it so much I bought it anyway. It has a real "Spaghetti Western" sound, and reminds me of Robert Rodriquez films also. I hope I get to use if for something someday.
1	its very good chantimng....
1	Very good album for relaxation.
1	As an orchestral musician, it would be easy to approach this recording with a critical ear. But within moments of hearing the rich acoustics of the cathedral, the purity of the voices and the blend of the ensemble, one is lost in the meaning and passion of Durufle's writing.  This recording is not about prowess and brilliance. It is about worship. It is about humility and grace applied to an aural canvas. Allow Durufle to paint his praise on your canvas...
1	Yeah it's true that this was the most overrated release of 2003. But it's also true that this was the best album that he has ever made(next to Guess Who's Back). Every wack album after this proves it. In Da Club was a huge record for him and Many Men, Wanksta, What Up Gangsta pretty much kept this album afloat. Eminem makes two dominating appearances on here(Patiently Waiting and Dont Push Me). Eminem floored 50 on Patiently Waiting and Both Em and Lloyd Banks leave 50 in the dust in Dont Push Me. Back Down while overrated was a good diss record towards Ja Rule and Murda Inc but they could have kept Alex Thomas fruit basket a** off of the record though. Gotta Make It Heaven is tight as well as the three bonus tracks: Wanksta, U Not Like Me and Life's On The Line. Contrary to popular belief this album is not a classic. Blood Hound feat Young Buck is weak. Like My Style feat Tony Yayo is straight garbage and Poor Lil Rich, P.I.M.P., and 21 Question feat Nate Dogg have filler written all over them. By the way, the bonus DVD is not worth mentioning. Other than that, this album was good but way overhyped. Even though GRODT is overrated in comparison to what came after it, GRODT is one of the few G-unit releases worth mentioning. Standouts: WHAT UP GANGSTA, PATIENTLY WAITING, MANY MEN(WISH DEATH), IN DA CLUB, HEAT, IF I CANT, BACK DOWN, DONT PUSH ME, GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN, U NOT LIKE ME and LIFE'S ON THE LINE.
1	loved the 2nd disc the most . gives you a real insight as to the goings on at the recording sessions . elvis loud and clear .  that golden voice . heaven  .
1	Great quality. Wonderful music! Our four little boys love listening to Mary on our car rides! Would definitely reccomend this CD!
1	Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
1	REBA IS AMAZING
1	Great on computer but hard to load to Android.
1	Easy Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fast Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No Problems what so ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Love it!  So glad I bought the entire MP3 album!  Absolutely the gest best!
1	Great song!
1	For those of you who remember Larry Lujack and Tommy Edwards from the great days of rock radio at WLS in Chicago, then you are familiar with their morning feature "Animal Stories."  For those of you who are too young to remember them, you will also love this volume of some of the wacky animal-related stories that listeners would send them to read on air.  I already owned the hilarious Animal Stories CDs Vol. I & II and was delighted with my recent purchase of Vol. III.  The stories are as hilarious and clever as the first two volumes, and listening to Lil' "snot nose" Tommy crack up when Lujack delivered his straight lines caused me to laugh out loud with him.  If you remember these two great DJs and WLS, you will love Volume III.  Listening to them brings back so many great memories of the 60s, 70s, and 80s when WLS was truly the greatest rock and roll station in the country.  For the younger set, you can get a sense of what radio was like back in those days, when DJs were more than just DJs--they were true personalities.  Larry Lujack and Tommy Edwards were two of the best ever, and they prove it with this hilarious third CD of those wacky stories.  Ow-ooooooooooo!!!!
1	great album from a great band. its a shame they haven't released anything in a very long time.
1	I think "Good Tree" is a very good CD.  Allison and her band have great songs and Allison's voice is beautiful.  I'm from Baton Rouge and i have seen the band play many times at the Caterie and i must say, their onstage performance is amazing.  If you want to listen to some good music with great lyrics that doesnt sound like everything else you hear on the radio, "Good Tree" is the album to get.  You won't be disappointed.  Keep up the good work Allison!
1	This track is as infectious as it is inspirational....like she said it's a feel good record. It's very enchanting and mystical. People need to be mindful of the fact that this is the title track for a movie, it was written specifically for the movie. shine on mimi!
1	This is one amazing album!  The last track, "Awakening", is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have heard in a very long time.  The whole album is extraordinary, and the occasional use of water effects adds a unique touch to the music.  Jo Blankenburg is a very talented composer who contributes to the world of film and television advertising.  Here are a few other albums he has composed:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elysium/dp/B008UY7DLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elysium</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vendetta-Position-Music-Orchestral-Series-Vol-6/dp/B004SPTNFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vendetta - Position Music Orchestral Series Vol. 6</a>  $4.95 is an amazing price for this set: Yes, there are only five tracks - but they are very long tracks, and in total you get over an hour of music (which is about the same amount as most 10-20 track albums).  Given that I like the artist, at this price I figured I would give this album a try.  I'm so glad I did.
1	What can I say it is Stevie Wonder and I knew him first as Little Stevie Wonder, he is one of the very best. His work has stood the test of time a testament to his considerable talent.
1	This song really ministers to ones spirit... if you are seeking help, directions, uplifting, meditate in this song... be blessed!
1	Love this song and his voice
1	LOVED IT
1	Excellent sounds.
1	download easy
1	Dwight Yoakam is just about the best practitioner these days of Classic Country (or whatever the marketers are calling it right now).  The music is clear and crisp, the singing terrific and the lyrics at the top of this form.  "A Thousand Miles From Nowhere" can be heard as a heartbreaker or as the cry of a fellow aiming for a fresh start.  Then there's the duet with Buck Owens called "Streets of Bakersfield" that is a wonderful homage to the music that Owens perfected half a century ago.  It's a masterful album and a great listen.
1	My baby girl loves it! Every time I put it in she's dancing from start to finish!!!!!
1	Glad I found it. Great song. Remember it from when I was a kid. Listen to it on AT 40.
1	Great .
1	The juxtaposition of Natalie as a gangster rapper is perfect.  Just listen to the sample and you will have to buy this.
1	Great show album
1	I love the music from that era. I have some of this set. I will be getting more of this set.
1	Awesome quality mp3.  I love Kurt lass but not normally Christmas songs.  This one I like.  Sounds good on small ear buds and on large home stereo system!
1	I have always been a huge fan of Christina's music & amazing voice.  Her new CD "Lotus" is by far one of her best ever.  I purchased the CD 3 weeks ago and have not taken it out of my car CD player.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who has been through a rough relationship.
1	WOW! THIS WAS THE FIRST ALBUM I BOUGHT BY AZIZA. IF YOU CAN PLAY PIANO LIKE THAT, SING LIKE THAT, WRITE LIKE THAT AND LET'S FACE IT; LOOK LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. THE TRACK DAHA (ALWAYS) IS HER BEST EVER, VOCALLY!  BUY IT!
1	This is another one of those songs that has such a great beat that it really would not have mattered what the lyrics were. Maroon 5 produced several hit tracks on this album.
1	Getting this album was long over due
1	hard one to find,Make That Money is my fave on here. Get one if you are a real Cooper fan people
1	I was pleasantly surprised when I loaded this disc up for a listen. Great recording. Excellent fidelity. After listening to internet radio for awhile I had forgotten how dynamic a CD can sound if the recording is top notch. This disc set is spot on, and a very good collection of some of Tim's work.
1	Great product; great seller
1	It's one of the best Daft punk songs I've heard in years. I hope the rest of the album is this good.
1	I love when God moves and break every chain that holds me back and allow me to be all I can be in him.
1	Very pleased with this.
1	His sound is very close to Fred Hammond, but then it's not.  Love his energy and his talent.  Make the investment, it's worth it.
1	Elvis covering Springsteen-- what could be wrong with that!?
1	This album was great Freddie Gibbs definitely shows his growth and versatility on this album FIRE
1	Love it.  It is the best.
1	I will look here for songs I can't find from my regular store.  The song arrangement was great.  If you are looking for a song you will probably find it here.
1	This is a lovely rendition and well worth the purchase price. You;ll definitely enjoy listening to it over and over again.
1	still a very good album
1	Love this album!!
1	Love
1	I have great memories with this song. I think that this is the first rap song
1	This is a great song! I bought the album a decade ago and I still listen to their songs !
1	This one is so new it is almost familiar. They have elements that seem like I should know who they are and yet the New Radicals are not a band from my day (the 1970's and the 1980's). They carry some of the spice of the old 'Stones, some of the smooth transitions of the older classic rockers, and they have a carrying style all their own. It is hard to say why, but it is just good stuff.
1	just plain good stuff.........from late 60,s to early 70,s solid rock & roll..you must get your hands on Hellbound Train from Spooky Tooth
1	good song
1	great
1	I'm not familiar with any of her music but this song due to Orange Is The New Black, but I had to pick it up. Simply awesome. Will definitely look into more of her music now.
1	i appreciated to be able to listen to this awesome band after all this time. eastern european punk and rock music used to mean something and kino personified this.
1	I enjoy listening to Bullock while I read or study. A good variety of instruments and songs. Some get repetitive at times, but I think that goes with the nature of the music.
1	One of Randy's best, with special meaning of course.  Just a great song, harmony, and meaning.
1	Josh groban is one of the best singers yet, his voice is given straight from heaven. I recommend all his songs.
1	This is an awesome song. I chose it because it has good lyrics, a good beat and I get excited when I hear this song. I would recommend it to family and friends.
1	What a cool song.  I was introduced to it by a very good friend and we worked it into the arrangement at my daughter's funeral.
1	amazing for meditation
1	SCC is always good and ministers to my music-loving heart.
1	Coldplay is one of my very favorite bands and I love love love this song Christmas Lights one of my very favorite Christmas songs so so good, so glad I got it, so happy with my purchase.
1	This is my favorite song hands down. The killers are my favorite band and this song is pretty inspiring. Love blasting it in the car.
1	Let it hit billboard.  Jussie is Timbaland's new Muse.
1	Had to have it, what more can I say?
1	My favorite track is the title song, "Born And Raised," which features angelic harmonies by David Crosby and Graham Nash (of course!), and finds the tabloid-riddled artist applying balm to his "quarter life crisis" with a dose of thirty-something maturity. In revealing intimate details of his own life (i.e., his parents' recent divorce, his stupid mouth, his numerous cringe-inducing tweets, etc.) Mayer is giving voice to a generation of emerging adults navigating the coming-of-age process in the era of social media and public meltdowns. Andy Warhol's notorious 15 minutes of fame prediction brought to life. From this perspective, Mayer's album is nothing short of a public service. Teenagers, take notes!
1	<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/This-Endris-Night/dp/B003H37U5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">This Endris Night</a>We listen to a LOT of Christmas music.  My husband is an organist at an Episcopal church and we both happen to like Christmas music anyway.  Having said that this album ranks among our favorites.  The arrangements are fresh and lovely; bowed psaltery, hammered dulcimer and recorders intertwine with timeless melodies and understated percussion.  Heather's voice is clear, expressive and lovely.  Her unique jazzy version of "The Holly and the Ivy" alone would be worth picking up this album for but her treatments of "Patapan", "I Saw Three Ships" and "The Huron Carol" are also of special note.  This will become a favorite on your holiday playlist!!
1	This one is for my wife to be
1	I just don't know what I can add to anyone who is a Whitney Houston fan that hasn't downloaded something of Whitney's.  I just loved this woman to much not to continuously keep up the beat.  Nothing can make that voice go bad in her older days of singing.  Love and Blessings still going out to my GIRL
1	My boys are 6 and 3 years old and this is their favorite song! Nothing better than a 3 year old singing that his God is awesome :)
1	This song is fantastic. I play it everyday. Robin Thicke is the best singer!!! This song is great. Love it!!!
1	LOVE IT!  I am a fan of Kirk Franklin -- if I could afford it, I would have his entire music collection!!!
1	1. Normal Madness 2. Cool As Hell 3. Mrs. Atom-Bomb 4. Holidys in Amsterdam 5. Crazy 6. Can Your Jackyl Do The Hyde 7. Famous F*ck 8. Stranded On Earth 9. Happy Judgement Day 10. Cosmic Dictator 11. Oh Yeah 12. Ready To Piss Off 13. North To Alaska 14. Good Morning Revolution 15. No Place To Gogo 16. I Believe In Elvis
1	Rock and roll!
1	I probably don't have to explain the simple math I just did. But just in case, what I'm saying is this: if you are a Disturbed fan or really like David's vocal style (or both like me) you are going to enjoy this and if you don't then you probably won't. Most of the songs on here have parts in them where you can pretty much find a counterpart in a Disturbed song. Dave's vocal style is exactly the same. If you come at this knowing what to expect you will be fine. As a bonus, there are awesome collaborations on here. Lzzy Hale (on a great cover of Ozzy and Lita's version), M. Shadows, Serj Tankian, Geezer Butler, Glenn Hughes AND an excellent cover of an excellent Nine Inch Nails song. There is a lot ot enjoy on this album. I'll admit to a +1 star bias though, I'd probably have given it 4 stars if I didn't love Disturbed so much (and I'm a big fan of Dave's vocal style and I really love most of those collaboraters lol). All in all, not really an original venture, kinda like Disturbed electronica if you will. I for one, do not think of that as a bad thing.  As for the songs themselves, my personal favorites are: Penance, Out of Line, Haze and Wish. I do skip one track though and that would be Through It All, I don't dislike the song but for whatever reason it just does not really catch me either. I do love his cover duet of Close my Eyes Forever with Lzzy Hale of Halestorm, she's one of my fave female rockers of our current times. The song itself is not one of my personal faves, but adding her to it makes me a happy guy. I very much enjoy all the rest of the songs on here. I've had Device on repeat play for the last 3 weeks and never got tired of it.  So I do recommend this album, and would hope people don't judge it on circumstances. I do think it will be a take it or leave it deal for most with the deal breaker being their feelings for Disturbed. But it is quite good and worth a listen IMO.
1	Did you ever listen to Hip Hop from good ol' Germany? NO? Well, you missed something. 'Fettes Brot' (fat bread in English) and the easy listening musician James Last worked together to produce this great title. Buy and  enjoy.
1	Awesome collection
1	Great cover of a Janis Joplin classic. Slade has a lot of songs that get overlooked, but they can rock out when they want to!.
1	Been standard product when Corce first introduced it. It has just hung around as aspecial effect. Now it is considered a dance tune.
1	This is song of the year! I woke up the other morning with this song in my head!! I love Happy!
1	ok, I'm showing my age here but I remember this coming out err um, 31 years ago. I NEVER grow tired of it.  Definitely one of Madonna's BEST!!
1	who is brains behind this operation? please come forward and take a bow. bow wow wow wow. then pick up the bossa stones. can't wait for the bossa kinks.
1	Words cannot describe my emphatic enthusiasm for this musical.
1	It's a Simon and Garfunkel classic.  How can you not like it?  And getting it from Amazon was very easy.
1	sweet song to listen to. great singer, and love all his songs but really love this sweet song. it's fun to listen to
1	The melody is inspiring. The song just makes you think about where you are in your spiritual journey. It's a great reminder to keep constant contact with God.
1	Fantastic
1	HARD LOVE is an anthem- a fist pump- for anyone who has ever had to love someone through hard times.  It is the title track for the latest album by NEEDTOBREATHE, a band that continues to evolve both lyrically and musically while continuing to write honest, relatable songs.  NEEDTOBREATHE is one of those bands who must be experienced live to be fully appreciated.  The passion, energy, and personality the band exudes bring the music to another level.
1	Good as always.  His interpretation of this song represent Yusef as he sounded years ago when I first saw him in Philadelphia.
1	I like the music and the vocals. Thats why I bought it. Asking me to a song I downloaded it ludicrous!
1	Very good collaboration between Daft Punk, Pharrell and Nile.
1	This sexy song reminds me of some sort of Marvin Gaye, MJ combination. Outstanding melody. Digital sound quality is excellent! Vocal styling is out of this world!
1	lovely tune, have the LP from 70s, HAD to add ity to PC
1	great
1	Norah Jones is an incredible talent and this song is indicative of what she can do.  It was her biggest hit and one of the most beautiful songs that has come along in a long time.
1	I have found this very helpful when I can't fall back to sleep again.  I keep it on an MP3 player on my night stand.  I don;t think I've reached the end of it awake in many uses.
1	I heard Laura Viers being interviewed on NPR.  I didn't rush right out and get her CD but found myself thinking about it over the next few days.  Finally I bought it, and listened to it all the way through, and again...and again.  Right now it's in my player more than any other CD.  It's easy to understand why the Decemberists guy has already proclaimed this the best album of 2010.  I also hear a little Neko Case in her voice, and the arrangements sometimes suggest Sufjan Stevens - all comparisons that have been made elsewhere.  She is indie, through and through.  To me her music is calming.  The music is mostly pretty stripped-down.  I like all the songs so much, it seems wrong to pick favorites, but I especially like Carol Kaye and Wide Eyed Legless (the latter in which she sets poetry by Rimbaud to music).  It's exciting to dicover a new artist (new to me anyway), and Laura Viers is a good one!
1	Love this song
1	A familiar Christmas carol with a moving reminder of what makes the birth so important. Well done!
1	Love this song
1	It's Prince! Plain and simply a legend! #RIP
1	I would not have bought it if it was less than fours stars....made my hands clap
1	Get yourself some Stephanie Miller, get yourself some decent Chardonnay, and you'll have a good ol' time!
1	great
1	Well deserved all the praise its gotten over the decades. I've loved it since it came out back in the 60's. Wanted it played at my wedding but the house band claimed they didn't have the music so played Colour My World.
1	Eric Arceneaux has a style that is missing from today's music.  The album itself is good.  My favorite tracks are "Say Goodbye" and "Won't Be Afraid"
1	I just purchased this CD and it is just as I expected. I love the sound of guitar, no lyrics. It is so relaxing, my 2 cats love it too. It relaxes them as well.
1	I love the songs, i am touched.
1	From the opening notes, the listener is enveloped in a soft warm cocoon of heavenly choir sounds on the album's title track. It's a wonderful welcome that prepares you for the serene listening experience that is about to unfold. As the piece develops, light percussive touches are added. What is interesting, however, is that in a lot of music the beat or percussion is much more prominent in the mix driving the song, while the more atmospheric elements are in the background. Here it is the opposite, and the percussion adds a subtle sense of forward motion without overpowering the ambience. It's a lovely balance that brought to mind the music of English recording artist Medwyn Goodall, as a reference point. While the next track, "Mystic Voyage" doesn't have percussion a gently percolating sequencer provides momentum. The keyboard melodies that David plays over his ethereal backgrounds are often understated and serve to maintain the meditative air.  On "Whispers from Eternity," wind and sparkling harp glissandos create a timeless soundscape to drift away on. One of my favorite tunes was "Metamorphose," which evolves from a dreamy formless state to a more upbeat, motion-driven composition. I particularly liked all the little spacey electronic sounds that weave in and out of the sonic tapestry. Another sound that added a refreshing new voice was the airy flute melody that graces a track called "Devi." A number of terms from Eastern religion appear in David's titles, reflecting the inspiration of his music. David's commitment to creating music that fosters inner peace is part of what appeals to me about the album and gives the music its lofty ambience. While David is classically trained on piano, he is quite adept in the ambient electronic realms and has an excellent sense of the kind of sounds, and their arrangement, that will enhance the ethereal nature of his compositions.  Each song is distinctive yet they flow together in a beautifully cohesive listening experience that allows the listener to remain immersed in the soothing vibe they create from beginning to end. In addition to enjoying it for active listening, it also makes a perfect backdrop for meditation, yoga, massage, or just relaxing after a long day. With his latest release, David Wahler has crafted a spirit-filled soundtrack to serenity that could appeal to a wide audience.
1	Just buy it!! Great CD!! And autographed!! Woooohooooo!
1	Well, my mother used to say this to me, and I think it is true.  But what is really great is the way Clarkson belts out this song.  Man!  This one was written and recorded to sing along with.
1	Live at the Ballroom must have been an amazing event. Larry Adler and Ellis Larkins (piano) live... with the added addition on the CD of George Gershwin (among others) on piano rolls.  Adler could make the harmonica sound like a full orchestra and Ellis is in his usual top form. A must CD if you want to hear the "master" at the top of his game.
1	I had this album on casette tape and decided to get it on CD finally. Wore out the tape (LOL, doubt I still have a casette player in the house) and this is one gorgeous album!
1	Great song
1	Sonny Boy was as smooth as silk and I love the sound of that low "C" harp.
1	nice baby Wes
1	This is my favorite Lynyrd Skynyrd song
1	This album is very strange.  The production is about the worst you've ever  heard, which is unfortunate because these guys place some very intense technical thrash- especially for 1991.  You can expect some very original riffing, impressive drumming, and bizarre, powerful vocals.  'Plan of Observation' is probably my favorite song.  The overall heaviness is definitely hurt by the hollow guitar tone and flat drums.  Give it a chance though, it's still way better than most other New Renaissance bands.  I'm not sure if this review gets attached to the seller who sold me this album, but if it does...they suck!  They sold me a copy with a hole-punched barcode and the CD was in fact pressed with a song missing.  Apparently this album is "famous" for being misprinted, and you need the LP or cassette to get the missing song.  Either way, I returned the CD but only after the lady tried to guilt trip me by saying she runs some battered women's shelter and returns like mine take money away from them.  Then it turned into a personal attack about how rude I was about the whole affair.  My fault for thinking a "collector's item" CD would come with an intact booklet, not to mention all of the album's songs.  Her final 'F.U.' statement was something to the effect of "good luck finding this album anywhere else, jerk!!!".  Yes, if only there was another way to obtain music nowadays.
1	One of my favorite songs. HAPPY to finally get MP3 version. What more can I say? These words are too many.
1	Sleek and Zef!
1	What's not to like!
1	A good country song on my Sansa Fuze I enjoy every day as  I work. Enjoy these country songs. Love it
1	Don't we all? We look in the wrong places
1	good song, of course, remembered it when I heard the Black Lillies cover it
1	Quel plaisir de dcouvrir des artistes comme Kem. Sa voix douce qui accompagne la musique vous prend et vous tranporte dans un voyage de reves paisibles. Dfinitivement un album que tout amoureux de ce genre de musique doit possder. Mon seul regret...ne pas l'avoir connu plus tot.
1	A good song from a pretty good band.
1	this is truly a great cd with great acoustics and lyrics they give a top performance with no exceptions. if you like them, you will like this.
1	she is outstanding
1	great
1	A very good song.
1	great song from a great new artist, can't wait to see her live
1	smooth cut
1	My daughter loves this. She listens to it over and over. After we watched the movie we immediately came home to download this.
1	I love this song
1	There's some nostalgia associated with this song that instantly takes me back to when the neo-soul movement was red hot.  This is a must have for your romantic playlists and serves as a time capsule for a fantastic period in soul music.
1	haunting music -- well suited to end of this movie  - looking to get more of Ms. elson
1	This is the definative moment in music history. This is the manifesto of heavy metal. This changed the way the world viewed music. Ride the lightning is by far their best work. The first song I ever heard was "For whom the Bell tolls" absolutely change my view of music
1	Love this song!
1	I love this song, the CD arrived in great condition
1	Riveting!
1	will put you to sleep in no time just sit back, listen, and relax
1	This song is awesome!!!!!
1	This is an amazing song!  I could loop it on repeat for hours.  Watch the SNL skit so you can see how powerful this song is.
1	There are notoriously few tools for parents to use in engaging Advent with their kids. Rain for Roots offers a new and creative resource, Waiting Songs. The album is a joy to listen to, even as it draws out the difficulty of waiting, and helps the listeners to enter into the sometimes awkward liminal space of Advent.  Here's a track-by-track overview.  1. O Come, O Come, Emmanuel  The album begins with a beautiful, stripped down version of my favorite Advent hymn. I've always taken this song to be the quintessential articulation of both Advents (so far!) of Christ. What better place to begin a season of waiting ("until the Son of God appear") than with this classic prayer-hymn?  2. Come Light Our Hearts  The full band is in on track 2: guitars, piano, lots of great harmonies, bass, banjo, drums.... Sandra McCracken affirms,  > For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait > Truly our hope is in you  It's a compelling and reassuring waltz, giving language to those who wait.  3. Isaiah 11  Next is a twangy, string-bending, rollicking country-ish number. "A little child will lead them," sing some wonderful mothers! Partway through there is a child reading from Isaiah 11:10, using Eugene Peterson's Message. The song goes from, "A good, good king will lead them" to, "A good, good king will lead us."  4. Every Valley (It's Hard to Wait)  Have you ever wondered how to explain Advent to a child? This gentle bluesy, soulful song does a great job:  > When you write a letter to a friend > And you don't know when > You'll hear back again > It's hard to wait > It's hard to wait > So hard to wait > When the one you love leaves on a plane > And you'll know that she'll > Come back some day > It's hard to wait > It's hard to wait > So hard to wait  BUT!  > There is gonna to be a day > Every low valley he will raise > There is gonna to be a day > Hills and mountains gonna be made plain > There is gonna be a day > Winding roads gonna be made straight > Comfort, comfort, comfort, comfort!  I noticed it was getting *awfully* dusty in my room as that song played.  5. The Weight of the World  I'm not a lover of the kind of the stylized vocals that carry this track, but the song itself is--like all the others--a good one: memorable, meaningful, and singable.  6. Mary Consoles Eve  First of all, I just saw Sister Grace Remington's "Virgin Mary Consoles Eve" image last Advent for the first time ever.  And now there's a song that accompanies it perfectly:  > Almost, not yet, already > Almost, not yet, already  And  > Eve, it's Mary > Now I'm a mother, too > The child I carry > A promise coming true > This baby comes to save us from our sin > A servant King, his kingdom without end  This whole album is so catchy and well-written--even more so than their previous album on the Kingdom of God, if that were possible!--and this is perhaps the song that will stick with listeners the most.  7. Zechariah  "Zechariah" is pretty funny, because not only is the story of Zechariah's speechlessness kind of funny (in retrospect! probably wasn't for him), but this song gives kids and parents a chance to talk and sing in a babbling, tongue-tied manner.  8. Magnificat  "Magnificat" is another catchy--if somewhat somber--tune. This track stands out less to me than some of the others, but that doesnt mean Ill be hitting fast-forward when it comes to track 8 on the album. Flo Paris Oakes's vocals and Kenny Hutsons guitar and mandolin work call to mind Lead Me On-era Amy Grant.  9. Great Rejoicing  Yet more beautiful lyrics:  > The troubles of this world > Will wither up and die > That river of tears made by the lonely > Someday will be dry > There's gonna be a great rejoicing  Also, while playing this song with my wife and three-year-old in the room, I asked my wife, "Do you like this music?" To which my *three-year-old* replied, "I DO like this music!" The pedal steel and Skye Peterson's lead vocals partway through the song are icing on the cake.  10. Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus  Waiting Songs ends much as it began: with a beautiful, stripped down version of a classic Advent hymn. (Side note to worship leaders: yes, there are Advent hymns in the hymnal! And you should sing the few of them that exist as many times as you can in the four Sundays leading up to Christmas.)  Rain for Roots's addition to the hymn will stay with you for days, even after your first time hearing it:  > We are waiting > We are waiting > We are waiting for You.  McCracken's "Hallelujah, what a Savior!" background vocals float above the "We are waiting," bringing the album to a satisfying close. Advent purists ought to be able to overlook the use of "the H-word" during Advent here. Or does "Hallelujah" sung on top of "We are waiting for you" deliberately point to Christ's next Advent, when he comes again in glory?  I really love this record, not just for myself, but for my kids, and for any other kids and families that have the privilege of hearing it! Also, I'm totally going to teach some of these songs to our congregation during our intergenerational Sunday school hour this Advent. They're excellent.  I was a big fan of Rain for Roots's previous album, too--it is still on regular rotation in our house, especially on road trips. But Waiting Songs even tops The Kingdom of Heaven is Like This. It's a remarkable record.  ------  Thanks so much for the good folks at Rain for Roots for the pre-release stream of the album so I could review it.
1	Heard this on the radio today, almost changed the station till I realized he wasn't preaching hate, but acceptance.  I bought the song immediately.  I hope it makes a change in attitude for everyone that has hate inside them.  Said a special prayer for this kind gentleman.
1	If you're a Sammi fan, you probably already have this.  If you haven't experienced Sammi, this is a great place to start.  Classic Sammi and without some of the "experimental" tracks she has on releases such as "Sammi v. Sammi."  All in Chinese, although that doesn't bother me.  Her voice is special.
1	If Dan Fogelberg and Jackson Browne had a baby, that off-spring would be Drexel Rayford. Okay, I know I've created a disturbing image, but Drexel has the same gift for creating harmonies and guitar licks as Dan and Jackson (plus, I'm sure I hear strains of America in there as well). The lyrics on this album are sometimes quirky and hilarious (Trailer Park Job); at others times, warm and tender (Warmth of Living Light). A spiritual maturity infuses this album - one that balances both the joy and pain that life throws our way. I hope folks will take a listen!
1	All it was cracked up to be
1	I'll keep this short, I grew up listening to Sarah Vaughan on 78's that my parents had. At 3 years old I would not go to sleep at night without listening to Sarah or Frank or even Stan Kenton. I am so delighted to find some of these old songs. Anybody that enjoys Sade and Alicia Keys should hear Sarah"s sultry voice as she delivers on this tune and others.
1	This song is so sweet. Beautiful voice, too. I hadn't heard of him before but I'm headed to buy the album. In an odd way, his quiet intensity reminds of me of Elliott Smith.
1	I must say, listening to this track really makes my day a lot better when I'm down. It has a great message and whenever you're down this track will without a doubt lift your spirits.
1	I had never heard of "A Great Big World" but last night when I watched Xtina perform with them, I was moved to tears.  It's a beautiful song.
1	Great music and fun lyrics!  Classic McClinton.  A must have for McClinton fans.
1	Excellent
1	Heard this lady on Pandora and this song really got my attention.  She is a really good writer and singer.
1	This is just plain silly...in spite of the fact that is was and still is, politically incorrect.
1	FANTASTIC!!!!!
1	Amazing song :-)
1	really like this
1	A fun song from its time
1	Beautiful rendition of a classic song! Well done.
1	David Phelps can sing any style, yet this is one of his best!  You will hear a parable in song - worthy of praise and blessing.  I believe I become teary-eyed every time I see or hear this number.  Don't hesitate - own it - you'll love it and GOD bless you.
1	Followed this band since I was a kid, Kansas has amazed me since the beginning, another band worth sitting down with, and cranking up the volume. A truly inspirational piece indeed.. A little band out of Kansas, hmmmmm, imagine that. Awesome stuff, get it.
1	great
1	This guy just gets better & better!
1	I am 23 years old and to all those Old schoolers who think us younsters don't know anything about Grown Folks Music, Well I am hear to tell them that they are wrong! I love me some Kem. I remember when I first heard the Sexy Track "Love Calls", I just lit up. I have never felt so Good. I thought he was talking to me! I thought to myself, if a man were to tell me those words, he would never have to worry about me. By being young, I don't know much about Al Jarro but Kem is all I need to know about. I listen to this cd from Track 1 - Track 10. It is just sooo smooth. "Love Calls" alone did it for me. I wished it had more songs but It is a great debut. I look forward to much more.
1	Happy,  thank you!
1	Praise God
1	god Halloween music I recommend it to anyone that's thinking of playing Halloween music and does good for parties excellent
1	Just wonderful. This is true clean music that anyone can listen to. Guy Sebastian is a king at making music if you haven't heard him.
1	cd is still super hot
1	Gr8
1	I LOVE EVERY TRACK ON THIS cd!
1	Very original songwriting and storyboard. This is a very good album for kids of all ages and sizes...
1	I have been a Tony Terry fan since the 80's and actually still have this in album form. Two very strong hits in With You that I think actually went to #1 R & B in the 80's and Head over Heels. He had another decent song in Everlasting Love. The rest was pretty average (I.E. two or three stars maybe). It is hard to argue with the strength of With You and Head over Heels.
1	What can I say about downloading an mp3. You pay download then listen. Easy as pie even for an old guy.
1	I found this in my Prime bargains and deals of the day spot. I use it to relax from stress or to help me sleep. It is great. Thank you Amazon!
1	Its amazing I have started listening to songs by Petula Clarke again,  due to me exercising with Richard Simmons CDs and hearing these songs again it just took me back to my younger years when I used to listen and sing along with her songs and love them so I downloaded my favorites and I just love listening to them
1	Love this song...It helps me welcome summer days,  with the thought of having fun with family and friends.
1	Excellent!
1	I thought the song selection for this CD was spot on!  The only song i was disappointed that was not on here was Marcella!
1	Great CD.Fast service. Good songs.
1	Fantastic!!!
1	My 15month and 4 tear old love this cd. They dance and sing together. Something they enjoy and can move around too.
1	Drawing from the 1950s and '60s, "Guitar in the Space Age" is Bill Frisell's tribute to iconic guitar songs of yesteryear. The album kicks off with one of the most recognizable surf tunes of all time, 'Pipeline.' Dark and brooding, it's a stunning retelling that makes for one of the effort's highlights. Lightening the mood, 'Turn Turn Turn' fills us with peace and good will. Popularized by the Byrds, this is a tribute to the memorable guitar work of David Crosby and Jim McGuinn. Next up is the blues standard, 'Messin' with the Kid.' On this song, the funk is turned all the way up. Things settle down for a beautiful rendition of the Beach Boys' 'Surfer Girl.' It's appropriate that the band gets dirty on Link Wray's 'Rumble' since it was one of the only instrumental singles to get banned from radio. 'The Shortest Day' is a genteel original. Duane Eddy's 'Rebel Rouser' is pure twang. 'Baja' is light-hearted sonic joy. The country comes out in Merle Travis' great 'Cannonball Rag.' Greg Leisz's steel guitar gives these sorts of songs a warm twang. 'Tired of Waiting for You' is a great retelling of the Kinks' 1965 hit. To give a shout-out to yesterday's six string heroes would be incomplete without the Jazz/Country duo of Speedy West and Jimmy Brant. Featuring delicious chord changes, the romance of West's 'Reflections from the Moon' makes it another sparkler on this project. 'Brant's Boogie' honors one of the all-time great wizards of the Fender Telecaster. In this case, we're not talking about Bill Frisell but Jimmy Brant. As the title suggests, the theme of the album is great guitar songs from the era of the space race. Along these lines, 'Lift Off' is Bill Frisell's moving original that would make a worthy soundtrack to the moon landing. The album closes with Joe Meek's 'Telstar.' Drawing from blues, country, folk/rock, pop, surf and rock & roll, "Guitar in the Space Age" is eclectic. As a guitar-centric endeavor, this makes for a fantastic instrumental album. Bill Frisell's guitar work seems to have lost the artistic edge it once had. His sound has evolved to become warmer and more accessible. Minor keyed cerebral innovation has been traded for enjoyment and warmth. This change shouldn't be thought of as good or bad as there are benefits to both musical orientations. At fifty-six minutes, this long playing album has the potential to be Frisell's most popular release in years. It's sure to appeal to guitar enthusiasts and those that enjoyed recent efforts like "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Big-Sur/dp/B00C5WR6JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Big Sur</a>" and "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/All-We-Are-Saying/dp/B005F9CORS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">All We Are Saying...</a>." Fly to the moon as Bill Frisell plays his favorite guitar songs from the 1950s and 60s.
1	I love Muse, and I love this song.  They are awesome. I think I might buy the album. I can't wait.
1	This is probably going to be the best Pink Floyd tribute to their late pianist and keyboardist, Richard Wright.  The blu-ray has a lot to offer in the way of video, and the still photos during the video show off what really happened in the studio.  I would highly recommend this for any die-hard Pink Floyd fan, and if you can get it on Amazon.com as I did, then the wait will be well worth the effort as well.  Happy listening!
1	Robert Plant continued on very nicely after LZ.  I enjoy all of his recordings, a great voice that has aged well.
1	Great song that didn't make the Hits record.
1	I LOVED this song!!! Proud 2nd Monkee fan...wonderful and sang it all the way home!
1	If you enjoyed Basket of Eggs, the companion CD to the re-release of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blast-Tyrant/dp/B004P05O98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blast Tyrant</a>, you'll love this short collection.  Pigtown Blues is the only completely new song, but it is definitely worth the purchase.  It's not entirely acoustic, but it shares the same stylings as the Basket of Eggs songs.  The Clutch staples of bluesy rock are present in fine form, with an up-tempo beat and classic Neal Fallon vocals.  The organ makes a welcome appearance in the background, and the guitar hooks and fills are very satisfying.  The second song is an acoustic version of Motherless Child, the best song from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Strange-Cousins-from-the-West/dp/B00292SQQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Strange Cousins from the West</a>.  I think I prefer the version from the 2009 album, but this is still a good rendition.  I love what Clutch is doing with this new sound, and I hope they do more of it (while I also would welcome some harder Blast Tyrant sounds).  Easy choice if you're a Clutch fan.  Pick it up.
1	good
1	Who doesn't love James Taylor?!  always respected him as a singer and songwriter, and this just adds to that opinion!
1	Another no-brainer. This sampler is jam-packed with great music and if you like Latin music, it is a keeper. In the flavor of Sergio Mendez (IMO), I thoroughly enjoy this.
1	A great song by a great singer
1	Great mix!
1	I've been a Blink fan for over 14 years and I have to admit that I didn't want to buy the album because Tom wasn't in the band anymore. With that said now I have to admit that I was wrong and this is the best album in years, blows away Neighborhoods. Reminds me a lot of TOYPAJ especially "She's out of her mind" that song sounds like it should have been on TOYPAJ. But then other songs like "Los Angeles" are completely new and will make you want to hear it live.
1	Love her music
1	(Note: This album actually gets 4 1/2 stars.) Andy Allo wears her influences on her sleeve, but manages to mix them in with her own style and aesthetic, making the end result sound just as it should. The extended endings of Superconductor, People Pleaser and If I Was King and When Stars Collide are appreciable, as well as the dreamy sound. Favorite tracks so far are Nothing More and When Stars Collide.
1	A star is born!
1	What an amazing group! I love the diversity of their sound and the vocal trade-off they created with Lynne Nixon doing lead and the guys doing backround vocals and then switching to the guys doing the lead vocal and Lynne doing backround vocal.  It's very exciting. My only disappointment is that there is no more material available by them.  Amazon did a great job of delivering my package in just two days,
1	Great
1	THE ROTHSCHILDS isn't the one of the most memorable of all Bock and Harnick scores.  But, it is still a great score all unto itself.  First of all, let me say, I met a gentemen at the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia on the Opening night of THE ROTHSCHILDS, and he said to me as the overture was concluding, there is more music coming out of that pit than in most musical out there today.  It is very true, this show is filled with some of the finest music you will ever hear.  Many people may not remember the show, but its' heard not to remember the beautiful score that only Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick could compose. This is a lost treasure, so  please take the time and rediscover a score that will please even the most critical of ears.  I listen to it on regular basis, you see I think Bock and Harnick are masters of the craft.
1	Usually I don't listen to music like this but as soon I heard it off this girls site I was hooked. BEst song on the CD I think is Bonnie Taylor Shakedown [2K4].
1	Love this tune
1	Cool Britannia pop rock? Alternative? UK women-fronted Elastica rocked in the 1990s and beyond. The lyrics and tone of voice are so insouciant yet powerful and on point. This catchy cut is still a favorite.
1	Great anthem for singing when you need to charge up!
1	A fantastic album the production and melodies are top-flight.
1	Killer tune from start to finish. So how about that full album of songs instead of releases that has one or two tracks on it ? these are the members who recorded xmas sux again ep. For the ones who enjoy the CD Pick this one up too while your at it.
1	Since I bought the set of three CDs, there is some duplication of course but they are good "traveling" music for the long car trips I take. Some things never get old.
1	Matchbox general puts out a good song!  I really don't like the fact that I have to say more in order to submit this
1	I purchased this for my husband for Valentine's Day. He is most happy with the selections and the skill of Ms. Benedetti.
1	As I said before, They Rock!
1	As a huge Cam'ron fan I was not dissappointed by the album and it was a step up from his last couple of albums. The sad part is I don't think Cam will ever get back to his prime in '03-'04 but for Cam fans this is good enough. Vado was a pleasant surprise and steals the album. I think the energy and the flow he has get you hyped up when you're listening- even if you're getting lost in lyrics like "dirty kitch". Not a groundbreaking album but a definite if you're a DipSet fan.
1	Enya is haunting music and good to the ears.  As a listener I enjoy the tracks on this CD.  Buy it and you will like it!
1	Great assortment of artists!  I had this set and played it so much, it was ruined.  I had to have another one, since I play it ALL THE TIME!
1	good
1	it touches my heart, it is very uplifting. it makes me think about what i will do when i do stand in His presence.
1	Always reminds me of walking the Camino. Great Movie and Soundtrack! The price was right as well at $5 for the download and booklet.
1	Reminds me of my youth in small town sweet innocent. Happy times of youth when all that mattered was having a friend you could be you around.
1	My girls love this, Great seller
1	Love the music.  I've been looking for her CDs for a long time.  Finally thought to check Amazon.  Glad I did.
1	Family friendly laughs abound in the sibling rivalry of the Smother's Brothers. My teenage niece roled her eyes at first but soon she was laughing too. The jokes may be over forty years old, but they have stood the test of time.
1	Love his songs
1	Great
1	I discovered this song while watching the "Grind The Crack" YouTube video.  This is an awesome, motivational song when I'm working out.
1	What an amazing song!!
1	This Album is just one of the many incredible CD's that have come from the heart of Karen Wheaton.  This CD has a blend of messages.  "There Is A God" reassuring us of our Heavenly Father; "A Friend Called Grace" delivers a message of forgiveness and mercy, no matter who you are or what you have done.  "Just Be There" is a heart gripping song from a parent to a child with the message that though the journey of life may be rough and you may stumble...when it is all said and done and they stand before the throne of God, just be there.  An anointed selection of songs and heart felt ballads.  Karen Wheaton is pure ministry.
1	LOVE the movie & found myself trying to sing this little song, only to get stuck.  Thanks for having a nice, inexpensive way for me to enjoy the song!
1	Toni Dolce's album is amazing, she is the female Josh Grobin.  The lyrics are beautiful and well thought out. I can't wait for her next album!!
1	Very relaxing. I use as background music in my classroom.
1	It is a nice inspirational song but I think Kandi needs to push herself more.  She seems to be stuck in the middle and maybe Todd can help her find her new u.
1	Who doesn't love this song.
1	It's my boyfriend's ringtone ;)
1	Love it
1	Love this song
1	William Murphy is very anointing.  The words speak to you.
1	Another classic timeless hit of Marvin Gaye's!  These songs always take me right back to the very first time I heard them!
