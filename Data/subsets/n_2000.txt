1	I assumed this would have some variance in it, but it is the same bowl being tapped over and over, no overlapping or changes throughout the whole, very long piece. I wonder if they just recorded one gap, then repeated it again and again. There must be better meditational "music" (and I use the term loosely there as it is nothing but the ringing of the bowl -- no other instruments, no melody, no chanting, ... nada) than this. I was very disappointed.
1	I would give 0 if it would let me. Worst release ever. Sounds nothing like the Tiger Army I know and loved. Horrible.
1	As already stated, this is an incomplete version.
1	Even though I had listened to a preview, this song turned out to be a duet that I didn't care for.
1	Many of the songs on these albums are 'covers', or other, unknown artists doing renditions of these rock classics. Some of them are bad remakes of the classics. For the price, I would think Amazon could have gotten actual copies of the various rock songs we knew and loved. Unless you are desperate or don't care, I'd recommend going somewhere else for the original artist's versions.
1	I have to say the heavy rain sounded like someone had a water hose or a boot that water was coming out of.  The wind sounded like something out of a 1950's bad movie.  Where was the thunder storm?  :(
1	I really liked the first two releases, and was looking forward to this release. It sounds nothing like the first two. It's awful and very painful and unpleasant to listen to. I know it's supposed to be different due to the halloween theme, but it still sounds just awful.
1	0304 is clearly Jewel's sellout to the pop music establishment.  C'mon, this is not Jewel.  Most of the album is so suggary, bubblegum sweet, after listening to it I need to see my dentist.  Look, I own every Jewel CD to date and have always been struck by her intelligent lyrics and folksy style.  This CD, however, has no depth or intelligence - just more of the teenage pop pubescence ubiquitous in top 40 music today.  Jewel has prostituted her talent with 0304.  That's too bad.
1	Horrible album.  Her voice is terrible.  May as well use the cd for a coaster.
1	I'm not sure what happened when they made these songs but it doesnt sound anything like the other CDs. Im not even sure if they are the same band. i love all the other CDs they came out with but this one sucks. It sucks to people that have herd* the other Cds but if ur into the whole punk weirdo music go for it.
1	It's kinda OK.
1	Sounds suck
1	C+ for effort, but execution lacks
1	Can STS fans honestly compare this favorably to their last 2 albums?  It's clearly an album of their "B" material to me.  I don't think they found one melody in all those permutations that I can remember, unlike so many tunes in their past albums that I can't get out of my head.  They've reached the top of what humans can do with their instruments, now it's time to spend a little more time writing the music.
1	I have seen and listened to Pink Floyd since their earliest years, and I continue to follow all the members to this day.  I looked forward to Roger's latest release and I was sickened.  It is depressing musically and lyrically is worse.  I can hear Trump anytime (all too often) for free on the TV, but to hear his voice, and hear lyrics about him is revolting.  A total waste of money.  It's going in the trash where it belongs.
1	I'm not sure who performed this piece (the mp3 download doesn't include that information) but they clearly struggled with it. I'm not a pianist but even I could pick up numerous mistakes and missed notes throughout the movements.  I will also echo the previous reviewer: there is a glitch in the mp3 in that it repeats itself at the end. I'm not sure if the error is on Amazon's part, or the actual recording, but either way, I cannot recommend this mp3 download.  I am going to delete it and instead download Jeno Jando's recording which is supposed to be superb.
1	Hate this kind of music. I am only buying it because I drive bus for special needs kids and I let one of my higher functioning students listen to a play list on my shuffle of the icky music he likes. Thank goodness for headphones!
1	We purchased this for our 7 week old colicy baby girl.  She loves it.  The only problem is, it stops playing around 18 minutes every time.  I've burned 4 CD's with the same result.  Before purchasing this CD, someone else wrote a review basically saying the same thing.  I just figured it was something wrong with the purchaser.  Unfortunately there is something wrong with the download.
1	Keep looking, because this isn't it!  This version cuts off shortly after the beat drops in, losing the best part.  I purchased this version AND the album version that SAYS "Acapella" but really isn't.  I ended up getting it off of You Tube for free instead!
1	Didn't like it at all,,I see why its a freebie,plus its about 2-3 minutes in its entirety,,not worth the time of listening too
1	Love it
1	On her debut, Susan came out as a surprise big voiced, no face winner and the beginning of a promising career. On this, her second official release, she delivers a Christmas(?) CD. I know a lot of artists these days try to stretch the Christmas a little far by adding Children's songs like When You Wish Upon A Star or even Over The Rainbow. Susan takes a Lou Reed song, Perfect Day and turns it into...? It IS nice and certainly does not remind me of baking cookies for Christmas. It reminds me of the sarcasm and wit of Lou Reed being reinvented by a Mary Tyler Moore meets Carol Burnett. 6 out of 10 songs can certainly claim their stake as holiday classics, however, Don't Dream It's Over remake does not! It's odd that she would put Silent Night on her annual CD and not a Christmas CD? Oh well...NEXT! Next...Susan Boyle Love CD for Valentines Day featuring Danny Boy and I'm Getting Nothing For Christmas!  lol
1	This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas, so I can't review this item
1	Only one song worth it ......the rest is profanity all over
1	People still use Holosync? You can literally make your own "Holosync" with Neuro Programmer 3. Just go to [...] "Holosync" is not a technology, it's just a brand name. The only thing Holosync does is lower the binaural beat pitch and you can do that using Neuro Programmer 3. Holosync is a complete rip-off. Don't be fooled. I find it amazing that people take offense to this revelation. You tell them that they're getting scammed and they get upset with you. Don't be one of "those" person's. Educate yourself and be smart.
1	The preview was exactly what I was looking for, but after downloading it, well suffice it to say, very disappointing.
1	wow all i have to say is 50 Cent has the whackest lyrics i've ever heard he talks about the same goddamn thing all the time the only reason i was even aware that fifty brought his retarted ass outta the ghetto was that Dr. Dre was working with him, and i thought to myself Dres beats an some new guy may b this will b good was i right? absolutley not if anything i'd smack dre for signing this idiot. All thats come out of fifty cents music is stupid white kids fromt the suburbs thinking their gangsters an thugs which they aren't. So fifty shut up and stop makin music ure killing the already dieing rap industry.
1	I love the band but it came warped
1	one word for this bubblegum...more  words for this, trendy, poser, pop, catchy, dance, disguised(it is really pop, but posers think it is metal),.....(new edit)- I will not spend time commenting or arguing to comments/posts. all I did was write a pretty blunt review. You can insult me or degrade me(I am not going to shed a tear over any of it). Basically what it all boils down to is I have much better things to invest my time in than arguing over a review( I have already replied to a few), If you want to comment, I am just letting you know that I am not commenting back. I am saving my time for comments on helpful advise on real product use such as  problems/solutions/tricks/troubleshooting Items such as: a chainsaw, string-trimmers, gasket making  materials, glues, backpacks,...etc. I really don't want to argue with a "Parrot"(I am not calling anyone a parrot (so please do not take it as such), I am just using an analogy).(And yes) I never bought this product...It popped up as a recommendation on amazon-I listened to this on youtube (well, I sampled through each song, not just one or two), formulated an opinion and wrote an opinion on it.
1	I really get sad when i hear this new RAP CRAP  on top of the greatest band ever...  i used to go see these guys when nobody even knew who they were.. maybe shows of 50 or 75 people.. that was the good ol days... God do i miss the House Man!!!!!
1	This is a super important record in that it answers the question "Is Sleepy LaBeef any good, or does he just have a cool name and great taste in material to cover?"
1	What happened? I expected an improvement on the reissue but what I got instead was a huge disappointment.  I listened to Volume 1 side by side with the original Storyville release. Gone on the new set are the great John R.T. Davies remasters. My sense is the they did a robo-remaster. No longer do you you hear the dynamics of the shellac. What you hear instead is the ever so faint but distinctive signature of an over-remastered recording. If you prefer forgetting these songs were ever on shellac, this might do for you. But if you know how it is supposed to sound, you will be disappointed.  This made in China set has other significant flaws. On volume 1, the song "It's You" is missing and "Making Faces at the Man in the Moon" is repeated. Volumes three through five do not display title info. On most of the songs the very first notes seem to be cut off. The DVD lists the Big Broadcast, Sleepy Time Down South, Moulin Rouge and Trans-Atlantic Merry Go Round. But all you get are screen scrapes from You Tube of Close Farmony, the famous Senators clapfest to We gotta Put the Sun Back in the Sky, and Louisiana Waddle.  The good things going for it are the full set of David McCain liner notes. I am struggling to come up with something else nice to say.  OK, so I am a purist. My hope was that this edition would correct some of the oddities of the first five volumes. A chronological collection of all the issued cuts would have been great. They could have added a disk of air checks and unissued sides as a bonus. Why not make it better? Why not actually approach the Boswell Museum to get it right this time?  The DVD is just pathetic. It comes straight from You Tube as the artifact of a forward button on Close Farmony attests.  If you cannot get the originals and you want to hear the Boswell Sisters complete recordings, then go ahead and buy this. Otherwise hold out for the original issues. And watch You Tube. It's free.
1	Love the up tempo version of this song , brings back memories what a great time to grow up
1	Plays fine. Badly warped.
1	The cd is ok, but I was expecting more of the song I heard on the series.
1	I am a HUGE fan of Pink Martini - I can sing all their songs from the first 3 albums by heart - I've nearly worn OUT my CDs.  This CD, however, is an enormous disappointment.  New writer?  There's no enthusiasm, no 'fun'.  China Forbes sounds like she's just seeing the music for the first time - or she's as bored as the listener.  The songs do not take advantage of her beautiful voice - they seem to stay close in range, and are ... well, boring, and truthfully? A little 'off'.  I'll keep listening to my first 3 CD's (and buying them for gifts) but THIS one's going out in the trash.  Really, listen to the first three, and you'll never believe this one is by the same people.
1	When buying this song "Everytime We Touch" by Cascada listen to the top three tunes. The third one down or the one that is the slowest version is the most beautiful and romantic. She lets herself flow into the song when it is slower. The faster version feels likes she's trying to race to get to the end of the song. Do not recommend the fast version at all. Yanou's Candlelight Mix CD of this song with Cascada is supreme and melts your soul and heart.  jk
1	Sounded like pure dog poo. His career is finished for suing H3H3, go to hell
1	south central cartel haven't put out quality record since all day everyday.
1	Sucks, downloaded it and now it won't play on any of my players. Of course there's no-ne to talk to about solving the issue Thought I might try deleting it and re-downloading but it seems that's not an option.
1	It was unfortunate that Krall chose to cover a song which Nancy Wilson did so beautifully. Krall has a nice voice, but there was no soul to this version. She seemed to just walk through it.
1	I like the music and think the artist could be pretty good. The audio QUALITY is completely awful. Everything is so distorted and compressed it sounds like you are listening to the album on laptop speakers. I think the music has potential but, the recording studio  ruined this one. Read other reviews, 1000s of people have noticed this, it is not just me. Unfortunately, I didn't see this until I figured it out for myself.
1	Youtube version of this song is 6:15 don't waste your pennies on this Youtube version of this song is 6:15 don't waste your pennies on this
1	Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.  I'm kinda disappointed, as the guests did not shine particularly bright either, so i'll give it a 2, maybe a 2.5 No knock on the message, thats great. But I didn't feel that this album was that good overall.
1	I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.  I have a wide range of taste, from Bob Dylan to Janis Joplin to Antonio Carlos Jobim to classical.  I see or hear no reason to purchase Ms. Winehouse's warblings because they just aren't good enough ... they're BORING!
1	i didn't purchase this
1	Uses a synthesizer in the background to add to the drone, awful.
1	Same singer but a much later version than the original that got air play in the 70's. It's a pretty poor performance.
1	I'm sorry to say it, but I really was dissapointed with this CD.  I found the music and lyrics to be very bland.  I don't think that this CD has introduced anything new at all to music.  I guess it is just not my style.
1	it wouldn't let me download my purchase.
1	I was disappointed. Too much potato, not enough meat.
1	In comparison to other mashups that I have heard, this is mediocre at best.  In general I find mashups to be very fun to listen to -- there's a huge variety of interesting rock and hip-hop samples in Feed the Animals... the problem is that they are jammed together unimaginatively and without much artistry.  A great comparison would be to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/As-Heard-on-Radio-Soulwax-Pt-2/dp/B0000636KJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2</a>, and the other radio soulwax compilations by 2 Many DJs.  Feed the Animals actually uses a lot of the exact same samples and artists, though Girl Talk is much more rap/hip-hop heavy, whereas radio soulwax tends more towards sampling other electronic music and pop.  A majority (but not all) of the transitions on this album are rather abrupt with hard boundaries -- it'll go beat-beat-switch, oh now I'm listening to something entirely different with no tie-in to what I was just hearing other than it has the same tempo.  In comparison, 2 Many DJs tend to creatively blend and layer the tracks into each other, and sometimes reintroduce sounds from 2 or 3 tracks ago to tie it all together.  In summary, this album has a scattering of enjoyable combinations, but they are very brief, end abruptly, and are mixed into the middle of long tracks.  It would have been better to divide this album up into 30 or 40 tracks so that we could excise the small clips that actually work -- the album doesn't play as a cohesive composition anyway.
1	The quality of music and recording was less than acceptable for this artist.  There were only a couple songs that I enjoyed, the others seemed to rely on too much electronic effects which took away from quality.  Given the amount of presale advertising and quality graphic design...this was a big disappointment coming from such a talented artist.
1	Trying to reinvent yourself isn't working for me. Doesn't even sound like 3DD anymore.
1	The song recording is what it is...the bit rate is no better than a cassette tape recording.  My suggestion for any further purchasers is to go to Itunes at least you'd get 256 kbps download for the same fee.
1	The name Trent Reznor used to mean so much more than it does today. Not too long ago it guaranteed that you would have an incomparable listening experience. Unsurprisingly, his flow of creativity has all but dried up after ridiculously overworking himself during the years since With Teeth-3 more studio albums, 1 of those a double disc + the collaboration with Saul Wiliams.  Sometimes less is more... while most fans never seem to get enough, I would've preferred it if he went off the map after touring his ass off & getting married. I would've preferred to NOT hear anything from or about him for at least another full year instead of being disappointed by rushed, unoriginal, subpar material like HTDA's "A Drowning". This is embarrassing on every level, and to everyone involved, especially Trent.  Overall the song's too similar to certain Massive Attack tracks (Angel, Dissolved Girl). The intrumentation is a rehash of NIN tracks, with piano bits reminiscent of Non-Entity or Right Where It Belongs, and the guitar parts sound like something straight off Year Zero. The generic lyrics, delivered by Mariqueen without a trace of emotion or personality, borrow heavily from NIN. It is downright laughable to hear such depressive, moody lines being uttered by a hipster chick from LA who is happily married & lives in a Beverly Hills mansion. Also, the thing seems to drag on forever, with nowhere to go but Dullsville. Should've been chopped down to half of its current length.  I still have hopes for the EP, but "A Drowning" flat-out sucks in every way.
1	The only solid foundation with you!!!
1	Very short, song cut off after 38 sec.  Very unhappy with it.
1	OMG Learn how to play more than ONE note!!!!!
1	I can't even find the song on my pc.  It's not in my itunes library (from which I load my iPod) so the purchase is pretty much a waste of time and a few cents.
1	Not the original recordings. New remakes of the old songs. DISAPPOINTING!
1	Nope...Capitol Records, I will not be buying the whole soundtrack for the one song I want. It's not like you are selling a cohesive artistic statement like Blonde on Blonde or OK Computer.
1	this is my seventh copy of this cd ,having played the previous 6 ,litterally to death. season of the with is possibly my all time favorite cut on any cd
1	First time that I buy a song from amazon and has such a terrible sound. Something is wrong with this song.
1	I really enjoyed David Cook on American Idol because of his originality and was looking forward to his debut rock album, but "Light On" is too predictable and sounds more like Soundgarden than David Cook.  I'm hoping the other tracks on the album have a more original sound to them and don't come across as being so outdated.
1	I was excited to see Tamar had another song out and purchased it without even listening to it.  The lyrics are original but the song is a sample of a song that I wasn't crazy.  I generally don't like when an artist samples a song with new lyrics.  I was very disappointed.
1	It is hard for me to understand why any military song/hymn can be charged for by Amazon.  If it had an asterik stating the money from this goes the the Navy Home or Marine Corps Home, etc.  I would be glad to buy it..But as it stands I will not now or ever pay a dime for any military song.  Capt/USMC/DAV  we fought to hard to put a price on it.
1	Yawn bad
1	Well...the music itself is engaging.  I had heard the song on a cruise ship and wanted the music to help learn the dance.  Sadly, the lyrics are nasty, even in the radio version.
1	It's hard to think that this album and Vessel are made by the same group.  This one is just a mediocre rapper singing mediocre lyrics that sound like lots of other mediocre rappers.  They clearly grew up and matured in the time between this album and Vessel, but Vessel is an ingeniously crafed piece of work that sounds completely original and is such a pleasure to the ears.  Forget this album, just buy Vessel and enjoy it.  Oh, and their live shows kick a**.
1	Ya know I only liked a few songs. Maybe because Iam younger I am more...picky. Personally they should have added more sintra, maybe some dean martin, a little bit of andrea bocelli and a whole lot of johnny lang. I am a new fan of RL burnside, that guy has got skills. Over all I wasn't pleased. The songs that I loved from the show didn't make it to the disc. I mean with a show like the sopranos you would think they would have a grade A soundtrack.
1	Im not sure why the previous person said its peaceful and warm, the songs transition abrubtly almost like they were cutting into each other(something you cannot hear when you listen to the samples). At one point the beat shifts and feels hurried and monotanous. There are also some parts that seem too engineered with the same beat tracks repeating in different songs. Also,some songs don't sound like they were put together in same studio by same person. Overall i wouldn't recommend this cd ...i couldn't concentrate on my form to this. Imagine getting relaxed for a yoga session you start your positions everything seems fine then you hear the phone ring repeatedly, traffic outside the window, an interior door slam and someone falling down the stairs. Thats how the songs transition! Then peace again ..then a train wreck oh wait thats this cd! I want my money back. DON'T WASTE yOURS
1	Contrary to the deceiving photo shown, this is NOT the most successful lineup of Fleetwood Mac with Lindsey and Stevie. I am not a fan of Fleetwood Mac's pre-Stevie/Lindsey lineup, so because I am not a blues fan I can't comment/review the actual music. Others are definitely fans of the previous lineup, so are more qualified to offer the purist's review. I'm not knocking the album at all (hey, I love a few of the songs from this era that made it to the new lineup, albeit redone by Lindsey), but others have dissed the error elsewhere on Amazon (there is more than one listing for this album.) I hope Amazon will fix the picture and provide an appropriate description.
1	Been a fan of Wiz since some of his mixtape hits like "Say Yeah" and "Paper Planes". I never liked any of his hits off this album that play on the radio but i decided to give it a listen and bought it. All i can say is I REGRET buying this album. Every song is about money and all the beats are nothing special. I only liked one song on this album. Dont buy this trash. Support the REAL and not the PHONIES.
1	Oh wow, this is so terrible. I'm one to download anything that's free from Amazon, but even I'm not keeping this one. Competing and losing on a TV talent show doesn't qualify you as an artist.
1	Eh
1	This thing blows. It is a horrible re-master as others have pointed out.  I'm not a real fan of the song but as a musician, I know them. Bought to learn it for a special show and now have to blow more money on the original.  Amazon; your song snippet didn't help at all- no lyrics which would have clued us in immediately. It's only a buck or so, but I want my money back, out of principle. Whomever killed this recording deserves nothing.
1	Band of Horses is a band that you can easily fall in love with.  Theyre all skinny bearded boys who sing in falsetto and play beautiful post rock country songs.  However, this album, lacks the generosity that the previous S/T album gave.  I would strongly urge you, reader, to listen to that one above this record.
1	I live with highway noise and all sorts of other distractions. Why in the world would I want to hear the beautiful Canon in D with freeway noise in the background?
1	Most of the songs I found to be greatest where not even on the cd especially Your so beautiful!
1	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous albums. Monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangements.
1	I bought this thinking that it could be funny, however it just didn't click for me.  I've heard him be funny on the radio so I bought the album, however it would strong recommend something else or some of his earlier work.
1	I was seriously expecting more than one song and a video.  Buyer beware!!!  I love the song, but disappointed in the my lack of research before putting it in my cart!!!
1	Sound quality of the mp3 was disappointing.
1	I love the song but when it says CLEAN on it I expect for the entire song to be clean not clean at the beginning and dirty towards the end.
1	Bram Stoker is probably rolling in his grave that anyone would put his name on this embarrassingly awful nonsense.  The characters are supposed to be intelligent and in a challenging archeological program but they act and speak like the stupidest, most uneducated people imaginable.  Apparently, the screenwriter has never encountered people whose minds could actually look past looking for beer and getting laid.  The story concerns an Aztec mummy found in Mexico that is on loan for a week for display and study to a university program.  A bunch of badly written and acted would be students decide to hold a party in the room with the mummy which, unfortunately, never actually happens because they are too stupid to procure booze or invite people.  Really boring things ensue.  This is dreadful as a horror movie with no suspense, no atmosphere, embarrassing dialogue, lousy acting and no discernable budget.  Unless you like really god-awful movies for some reason this garbage should be avoided at all costs.  Destroying every existing copy would probably make the world a slightly better place.
1	Cuban jazz this ain't.  Very disappointing, overly arranged, very little pizazz.
1	What a disappointment after his first two albums.  If you're here looking for country music, this ain't it.  Sturgill, you're an awesome country singer, don't try to be something else.
1	Group is older now, not nearly as good as the original.  Would not have purchased had I looked closer at the date.
1	Boring.  Has no edge.  Sorry, I like their older stuff.  This sounds washed out and lacks variety from song to song.
1	I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect. The result is essentially white noise - unlistenable. Definitely for completists only. And don't bother to pay the elevated price from dealers here. A short internet search will reveal that it is still available from The Stone's webshop. This limited edition will take some time to sell out.
1	could not even finish listening to this did not recognize a lot of the artists di dnot care for the music deleted it from kindle
1	I was extrememly disappointed. If it wouldn't cost me to return it, I would. So, it's open for "used" sale to anyone that wants it.
1	Not the version I thought
1	Loved the album, so for anyone questioning the quality of the content I love the songs on this album. My gripe was with the product condition when it arrived. I'll just attach a picture and I'm sure you can spot my problem.
1	For all of you who love Ghost in the Shell and music by Yoko Kanno, this is not it!  This is scream death metal or something.  Needs a better title that isn't already pretty much used.
1	I didn't even download it. Had to stop the preview and lower the volume. So irritating!
1	This version is the live of Dream on and not the studio version. Still a great song but it would have been nice if it said it was the live version.
1	From front to back, this is just possibly the most horrible thing I've ever heard. I'd rather have someone drag my genitals through 2 miles of broken glass with a cactus in my rectum than listen to this.
1	I'll admit I am Beyonce fan and somewhat of a Justin fan but this remix, yes REMIX is terrible. Now, While Beyonce's Vocals are great and on point, Justin's remain the same as his original which for me, throws me off since they called it a "Duet". My opinion : if it was really a duet, Justin's vocals would be new, also. So, it's more of a remix than a duet. I Think if Justin had new vocals for the song, it would be more enjoyable.  This would have been a lot better, in my opinion had it contained new vocals from JT
1	I thought this was mc serch but turns out it was just mc turd and it stinks
1	I didn't even get to listen the whole song, half way through and it stops. It sucks. >.<
1	Without the video, song makes no sense. It is as if the song was made for the video,  not vice versa.  Now hopefully the Beygency won't come after for this review. ;-)
1	This EP comprises three tracks from the 1961 album by the brilliant flamenco guitarist Sabicas (1912-90), which (as far as I'm aware) has never appeared on CD.  It's a masterclass in arranging for three guitars  Amazon's track-listing gives the titles of pieces but not the styles, so I list these below:  1) Milonga Inspiraci&oacute;n de Sabicas 2) Alegr&iacute;as Ol&eacute;, mis tres guitarras 3) Ronde&ntilde;a De los laureles  But this album was recorded in stereo, and Amazon's samples sound to me like mono!  Ecchh.  Digitally remastered, indeed!  In my opinion you'd be better off with the stereo LP (Columbia WS-320 or Hispavox HXS 000-03).
1	It's a listenable album, but there isn't much soul behind it.  Everything seems very generic and only a few songs seem to capture true emotion.
1	Not good...I even checked out the youtube video of it,to give the band a second chance,nothing good is in this track.
1	The sound bites on Amazon sounded interesting but the CD not so much. Not jazz, sounds more like the sound track music to a movie
1	I can't believe they released this...  The audio is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I threw it in the garbage.  They shouldn't be "premitted" to sell this on amazon.
1	I VOTED FOR HIM ON SUNDAY BEST BUT WHEN i LISTEN TO THE SONGS THE FEELINGS IS NOT THERE IT JUST TOO MUCH CONTEMPORARY THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS NOT THERE AND HE SOUND LIKE HE WAS FORCING HIMSELF TO SING IT DID NOT SOUND LIKE THE SONGS WAS COMING FROM HIS SOUL WHERE WAS DONNIE MC CLAUKLIN WHEN HE WAS RECORDING?
1	this CD contains tracks taken from the internet, no quality, legal CDs should be acknowledged by Francoise Pourcel. Please do not encourage this kind of CDs on the market
1	Wasn't what I expected
1	I am absolutely furious! The first CD I ordered was missing from the package....I received the 2nd one today...I paid 15.99 for it....IT HAS ONE SONG ON IT!!!!!
1	Album solid, this is a review of the vinyl. The special edition white vinyl is flawed with black smudges on vinyl 2. They do not come off with cleaning. What good is it to get the colored vinyl when it's smudged? Skipped on a Jensen player at my family's house but is playing through on my Audio Technica. I'm disappointed because I can't get an exchange due to it being out of stock now. Was a Christmas gift for my 17 YO.
1	It's a haunting tune, but the crew that recorded this live version needs to go back to school. It's mostly unintelligible garble, although Sarah's tone is beautiful.
1	Love it.
1	I thought this was the solo song but it's some other recording. Not near as good.
1	My wife and I LOVE Motion City Soundtrack.  Their debut album was pretty good, their sophomore effort was, of course, a modern classic, "Even If It Kills Me" was really good but nowhere near as amazing as "Commit This To Memory".... and THIS.... well, this is pretty bad.  It feels rushed and it seems the boys in MCS are trying to escape the things that made them unique in the first place.  Justin, whose quiet and wavering voice sounded beautiful on the previous albums, is straining his voice to reach high notes that are unnecessary for the songs he's singing, and the Moog keyboard that is so synonymous with MCS is all but completely absent from the album.  None of the songs feel like sing-alongs, nothing seems catchy and memorable, and... well, this is another proven point that moving to a major label doesn't always warrant a good album (I'm looking at you, Anti-Flag, as another example).  And for those who said "It'll grow on you", I've listened to this album numerous times. Hasn't grown on me.  I'll stick with their last two albums.
1	Even though this (single) version has a 256k Bit Rate, I was not at all pleased with the tinny, almost distorted quality.  It's a poor cut like off a cheap AM radio.  I really like the song; maybe the Album version is better, but steer clear of this one.
1	This is a great soundtrack if you are a Maurice White or Earth, Wind & Fire fan.  The music is easily recognizable as Maurice White music and can be enjoyed even if you have not seen the Gatchaman movie.  Con: The only problem with this one is that if you buy Volume 2 you will get all of the same music that is on this CD plus the alternate version of each song.  I would recommend for the value buy Vol 2 instead of this title and avoid buying both Vol 1 & 2 since you'll just be wasting money on the same music.
1	Bought with Amazon Coins but ended up not caring for the song or singer.
1	I love the song but I cannot understand why I had to install QuickTime ( or whatever the software is called) to listen to it.. Once I actually did that and was able to hear the song the sound quality was really bad - it keeps crackling so I am going to send this CD back..  Sorry its not good enough..
1	Audio quality very poor.  Sounds distorted and fuzzy.  Almost as if an analog master was converted to digital.  Wish I would have downloaded something else...
1	Sum 41 give punk a bad name. Sum 41 take the Green Day/Blink 182 vein and play all the MTV clichs of what MTV think punk is. The image of punk that MTV is some bored teenager with piercings, hoodie, big baggy pants, and a skateboard. This poppy nonsense is just silly and goofy. This is not hard! Even Blink 182 are more real than these guys.  If you are between the age of 11 to 15, i can see you into this. Then you realize these guy are pandering MTV creations.
1	I listened to the preview and I find it kind of annoying that this is even listed with all of these musical pieces.
1	These guys stink, just like any so called "punk" rock today. Don't buy this.
1	Just okay.
1	Not that big of a fan of this download from Coldplay.  I like a lot of their music, but Bo Bryce sings this song better.  Had there been one of her downloads for this song, it would have been the version I would have downloaded, even though Coldplay made it popular.
1	Sorry KE. I'm a HUGE Fan. Been one since the early days- b4 you were Grammy nominated. But this ones- just not for me. I like it better when you are being creative- and really imparting YOUR writing and "vocal-ese" to yo work. Not just covering other's material(s). Always great to see KURT Live! He and Lawrence never fail to entertain the room.
1	Very loud floor of noise present on all tracks.  Generally unlistenable even on low grade equipment.  Such a poor recording environment might go unnoticed with a metal band, but it ruins this CD.
1	I've owned the Lombard/Erato "Cosi" on RCA Red Seal LPs for years - the set was a product of a marketing arrangement between the two companies in the late 1970s. That set is a decent performance and an opportunity to hear Te Kanawa as Fiordiligi. When I saw Lombard as the conductor of this download, I assumed it was that recording. Since the LPs come from one of RCA's "tick and pop" periods, I downloaded the MP3.  Something didn't sound right on initial hearings. None of the singers sound like Te Kanawa, Von Stade, Stratas, etc. A-B comparisons between the MP3 and the LPs convinced me this is not the Lombard recording - the discographies I've found on line list the Erato set with the Strasbourg Philharmonic and Opera du Rhin as his only commercial recording. Aside from the conductor, Amazon does not identify the participants. I can't identify the singers.  I advised Amazon of the discrepancy and Customer Service agrees there is something wrong with this item, which they are proceeding to correct. Amazon has also issued me a full refund of the purchase price. I emphasize that my one star rating is based exclusively on the fact that this isn't what it presents itself to be.  Unless you want an anonymous "Cosi" my recommendation is to avoid this.
1	Usually I really like this song, but not sure about this particular mix. Not the same one I'm used to hearing. Didn't really care for it.
1	Vocals and production are SOOO good . . . but with insanely boring songs . . .  I cannot give one of my favorite singers more than 2 stars.  This album is a sleeper. All pop or hip-hop are totally missing (except, of course, for the gratuitous guest-rap by Ludacris).  After an amazing album by Brandy a little over a year ago, I was hoping for a revamped Monica on her tails, but all I'm hearing is old (and not in a good way) R&B.  If you're looking for something to fall asleep to or to give to your grandma, this is it. Even the Missy-produced tracks are super low-key.  It seems odd that both Whitney and Mary J.'s albums last year sounded more contemporary than this.
1	I love this song but this is NOT the radio edit.  This is the regular version which I have with all the dirty words.  If they had a preview for this song I would have not have bought this but they didn't.  Thanks for nothing.
1	Not the lyrics everybody is expecting in the intro. Does not mention L.A.
1	It was not what I was looking for I want the original song it cool that it live but not what I desiring
1	No idea how anyone could give this more than one star, except maybe for sentimental reasons and hey, it's Henley.  One of the all-time worst CDs I've ever heard.  The cut with Mick Jagger cannot be listened to, it's so awful.  And Parton is 2d worst.  This whole thing is one big mess, and a very bad idea on Henley's part.  If you are expecting a nice mellow Henley with some newer tunes that add to his incredible repertoire, then don't do it -- you'll be so sorry.  I listened to this twice, then gave it to my cousin; she didn't make it all the way through a single time, and ended up throwing this in the rubbish.  Really, really awful.  Sorry, Don.  Gave it to my cousin, a big Eagles fan, and she threw it away.
1	I love this song, it has a great dancing beat. Do not like this version:(
1	I am really disappointed with this album. I know bands grow and their style changes, but I don't know what the hell happened here.  Love MCR though.
1	this is still NOT the explicit/dirty version!! im VERY pissed off!!
1	This is a sad and significant departure from the earthy blues soul rock of all their previous records. It's an obvious nod to the pop money machine. I would have NEVER thought Grace would do this. Look - I am a huge fan. I have seen her live three times, I own everything she has done. But what was great was it was about the band - an exceptionally tight band. Now its about  "Grace Potter". Note they dropped the band name Grace Potter & The Nocturnals - "you will sell more records this way" - maybe or maybe not. Is that the point? Very disappointed. So, I will sit this one out and hope THEY return as the great band they were. Every one is entitled to a mistake - and that's what this CD is.
1	i don't know what's going through jewel's mind now.. i mean i am a big (or maybe was) fan of her music, but now i'm just so terribly disappointed. i wanted to give it a half a star but i guess it wasn't possible.. so so very disappointed.
1	Ugh. Not objectively terrible, but it sounds like a Coldplay album. You could seriously have Chris Martin sing all these songs and pass it off as a Coldplay album.
1	I'm all about good breathing techniques but this seems to be set-up that everybody has a breathing problem in order to sell their system....not impressed.....A lot of people shot her down, but I really recommend Greer Childers Body Flex....very simple to learn, but very effective for about 20 bucks.....and once you learn it, you always have it....
1	That's how it is with most pop songs these days.  This one, however, is even more annoying than others I've heard lately on the radio, since the originality doesn't amount to ANYTHING, let alone something remotely interesting to listen to. Lines like "I'm wearin' all my favorite brands" and "I came to move/get out the way of me and my crew/I'm in the club and I'm gonna do/just what the f--- I came here to do" just make me roll my eyes.  I thought it would be catchy and mindless (and fun to listen to for a few weeks), but it's just pointless.
1	Though I have been charged for this download, I have not received it.  This is my first song to order, and I'm very disappointed.
1	Stars
1	Really an entire song with one word no in it, I would give it less if I could!!!!.
1	Worth what they charge.  No more.
1	Badly produced.  Warning:do not listen using headphones.
1	I strongly urge you NOT to spend your money here. These CDs are produced by the "Global Stage Orchestra" which despite the name, is not a real orchestra. All the tracks on these discs were generated by a synthesizer. I have suspicions that the monkeys who call themselves an "orchestra" simply got a hold of the MIDI files for the scores and played them back on the computer...and sell you the result. Even I could do that!  These tracks simply sound terrible!! Nothing like the originals. The Pirates of the Caribbean sound track is one of my all-time favorites and I was quite excited about receiving this set. Instead, I threw them in the trash after about 5min of listening. Disgusting.  I strongly urge you NOT to spend your money here. Go somewhere else and buy the real sound tracks.
1	this cd is one of the worst cd's i have ever heard . it has to be the most overrated cd by the most overrated band in history. the vocals make no sense and just sound terrible. the guitars lack focus and the drumming of grohl is just sloppy. metallica's cd is much better, and the  longevity of its popularity proves it.
1	This song go's back to the early 80's and could be heard on the radio as well as different night clubs.  Turn Your Love Around by George Benson was and still is one of my favorite songs.  It is One of those songs that you never get tired of and is very enjoyable to listen to even today.
1	For some reason Amazon won't play this song in my library.....Wasted money!
1	This guy is a complete racist for starters.  This type of music should be recognized as garbage and nothing more. I used to like kanye back in the early 2000's. This dude has taken his talent and threw it out the window because people like to hear him say pretty gross and familiar rapper trash. Its easy to understand and you don't have to be smart to like it.
1	I would have loved this but singer lost it for me. He did not seem to fit. I'm not sure what he was trying to do, a David Sylvian impression? He's probably a real nice guy but his voice made me turn it off after several attempts to get through the CD. Needless to say the music and the drumming is great. Did I mention I did not care for the singer?
1	There could be hope!! Now that Jewel has given up music perhaps we could see the return of DAYNA MANNING. Dayna Manning deserves a lot more recognition in the world than she has. This could be her chance while the real Jewel is in retirement. Trust me music fans Dayna will not let us down.
1	This is about the farthest thing from country music I can think of. WHoa smack!
1	sound is not clear
1	I got this to use in a video montage for my sister-in-law who just recently had their first baby. I didn't use it. Well for the most part the song sounds like a brassy lullaby somewhere near the end you have a more traditional orchestra swell, where it gets really loud and no longer sounds like a lullaby at all. I wouldn't recommend it at all for a go to sleep calm lullaby.
1	Im a real hip hop head. The beats go hard, but Rick Rock lyrics doesnt. I was really dissapointed in this CD. Rick Ross went commercial
1	Didn't care much for it. I gave it to someone who said they liked it. A couple tunes were ok but not worth listening to the others to get to them. Lead singer trying to sound like he was straight out of hell. I pretty sure he isn't and therefore being a faker.
1	I purchased this music cd to use as a background for my balloon twisting art.  I won't be doing this.  The Calliope sound was clear and great, but the quality of the bass instrument (Tuba?) was fuzzy sounding, not clear.  It was annoying to me.  Not being a musician, I don't know how to best describe it, but it was not good.  There was a great selection of Carousel Music on this CD.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Good-Old-USA-Carousel-Music-Vol-1/dp/B00003GOHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Good Old USA Carousel Music Vol. 1</a>
1	was just OK don't really care for there version but others may like it nothing more to say Happy new Yaer
1	I bought this song to use with the book, however the lyrics/words within the song do not match the words in the book.  I guess this was done due to copyright issues, however it would have been nice to know before I purchased the song!  The preview did not provide an adequate/accurate representation of the song.  I certainly would not have wasted my money had I known!
1	Enough about the song, what about the cover art? Hideous! It's like an 80s argyle pattern threw up on itself! and that look he always poses, with the eyebrows, what a kook!
1	I am not a fan of the new stuff. :(
1	this is truly awful. Bob Dylan gets a star for effort, but the performance here is dreadful. I do get a kick out of reviewers who tell you that this is great!! It isn't. I want to like it... I tried to like it... but it's really bad. Fallen Angels indeed.
1	Only one song I really like "Walk Away Renee".  "Pretty Ballerina" is ok but the rest of the songs are not very good.
1	This is by far the worse song GAGA has ever written, in fact Rebecca Black's "Friday" has more intelligent thought put into it than this. This song is so tacky and dumb, it wouldn't even be played in the background of a porno.
1	This deserves no stars, this was a replacement for the first one I bought which skipped terribly and this one is just as bad. I've never had an issue with Amazon until now. Get it together.
1	As a PF fan since 1971 I found this one to be much less than expected. Just a bunch of out takes that were polished up to....OUT TAKES.
1	Not the Katherine K Davis version. It's some weird and awful version. Don't buy, it's a total waste of money.
1	Van halen live is a great album when it comes to the musicians especially Wolfgang who has replaced Michael Anthony but just something is lacking in Roths vocals.  It just lacks conviction and flair and it is like what Eddie Wilson said in the cruisers it is like bad sheets spread em out soil em ship em out to laundry.  Just as Robert plants sans the high notes same here with Roth  Performance wise four stars but singing wise one and on top of that Alex and michaels harmonizing are not present due to Michael Anthonys departure.
1	The package did include two vinyls. Unfortunately they were BOTH side C/D but no side A/B. Sad, as it was bought as a Christmas gift.
1	As a die-hard Squeeze fan, I must advise others that, in my opinion, this is their weakest offering. Holding perhaps two listenable pop tunes ("If It's Love" and "She Doesn't Have to Shave") the rest is best described as medicocre filler. Both albums that came afterward ("Play" amd "Some Fantastic Place") are FAR superior and highly recommended.
1	I like milkshake with ice cream and milk but this song sure does suck on so many levels ! Didn't your career died 10 years ago ?
1	Randy Travis is an upstanding Republican and friend of the Bush family.  Got a joke for you.  Who wrecks their car while apparently drunk, goes to a convenience store necked to buy a pack of cigarettes (oops no cash!), and then lays necked in the middle of the road waiting for the cops, who he then reportedly threatens to kill.  Answer: Randy Travis!  Awe those Republicans!
1	Completely different than what I expected from Duff Mckagan. Not even close to his past work. not my cup of tea.
1	THis song sucks. plain and simple. Soulja boy has no talent, and he will never be as good as REAL rappers. Soulja Boy...LEAVE THE RAP MUSIC FOR THE BIG BOYS!! the lyrical content in this song is so stupid! "Kiss me thru te phone"????? the only reason that i even gave a 1 star rating is for the beat. even though they're all default beats, its halfway decent. If T.I. , T-Pain or someone who's actually good, it would have been better.
1	TERRIBLE. Absolutely terrible. And I don't mean the band. In fact the band is one of my favorites!! There style is amazing and unique. But the vinyl quality sucked:( I was so amazed looking at the cool red and green vinyl color but when I put it on the record player it SUCKED! I couldn't understand them. It was skipping and not only that but it was totally warped! So pissed off cause I was really looking forward to it :/ just purchase your vinyls at a store next time!
1	wasn't the right one I thought I ordered . need to be more clear on the information .
1	Worst Bond song since Lulu recorded Man With the Golden Gun. It's tuneless and desperately trying to sound like Adele. Thankfully the reviews for the movie sound good.
1	Gift
1	50 is one of the best examples of a rapper having more hype and credibility than one deserves. He rides with Em and Dre does his beats but I cant give him any credit for that. He took nine bullets but c'mon everybody should know that all the real gangstas are dead, in prison, or still hustlin. REAL GANGSTAS DONT RAP. Alot of reviewers say that this is tight gangsta rap or that 50 is trying to bring gangsta rap back but to tell the truth, this guy needs to work on his lyrical skill. If this album came out in 91-96 it probably would be laughed at because he cant compare with the likes of big and pac or any of the other tight albums of the period. I believe many of the people giving this guy good reviews are either young (not hearing the good rap music from the early to mid nineties) or are so starved by the weakness of todays rap game that anything half decent is the shiz these days.  He talks smack about rappers I hate (certain ones making songs for females and club songs) which I like, but then he turns himself into a hypocrit by releasing In da Club as a first single and 21 questions (a definite female song)as his next. Yes, there are some good songs on this cd (about 5). The rest however are marred by bad lyrics or stupid hooks.
1	The vocal quality is okay, but not the rest.  Nearly every piece is in the same key, and melodies sound almost the same from one piece to the next.  I absolutely love Messianic music, and listen to it all the time.  Myrna's album was recommended by a friend who says this is her favorite CD.  To each his own.  I'm a professional, highly trained, musician, and I did not enjoy it at all.
1	Yeah, daddy's girls could sing but the late eighties/early nineties sterile overproduction mars the track significantly. Although they had a hit with it, it hasn't aged well, like a lot of the music from that era (you know the era, back when people walked around looking like arsenio hall or will smith in the fresh prince) They migth've really produced a timeless track if Brian Wilson had produced. Never got the lyrics for the song either. Something about a change and breakin free from the change.
1	I can't really review this song as it never downloaded to my device, and it isn't on the cloud player.
1	I thought this was a new album, not just a new song.  I paid over $20 for two songs! What a rip off!!
1	"Illuminations" is not even mediocre.  Not one song demands a second listen.  For example, I'm sure Josh had Don McLean's "Vincent" (a Groban personal favorite) in mind when he wrote "Galileo", but his ode to the astronomist ("oh goody, I can sing about stars and skies again") is just plain odorous.  It's a piece of contrived emotion that fails miserably.  And the others are even worse.  Groban can sing, but whovever told him he could write did him a big disservice. There are plenty of penniless, passionate, "straight from the heart" songwriters out there who will stay broke because good intentions and a little bit of piano playing ability don't equate to song writing talent. Groban needs to write this album off as a horrific experiment and start seeking out the professionals who know how to create a memorable tune.  A great voice needs a great song.  There are plenty of well written standards that Josh could introduce to a new audience and make them his own.  But not this junk.  This stuff wouldn't make the grade in a middle school talent show. It's a waste of time, talent, effort and money for everyone involved, not to mention the huge disappointment to fans who plunked down good money for this crap expecting something of caliber.
1	He fails to get the whistling right and they start talking about it. If you want the one that you heard on the radio and liked, this isn't it. I wasted my buck and I'm not happy about it.
1	This is not a Super Audio CD and the product description needs to be corrected to reflect this.
1	I have to say I was far from impressed with the most recent outing of the Boys from Brooklyn's talents. Ok I know not every CD can be as good as October Rust and I wouldn't want a repeat performance but geez! Out of the entire CD there were only 2 tracks that were even remotely close to the kind of music that I love and expect from one of my favorite rock bands (and even those were so unmemoroable that I can't recall them at the moment) How disappointing! I'm sorry to say I expected much much more from these guys than the generic thrash metal bang clang roar that I heard here. I think I'll go play some of their REAL music and sob in my corner now.
1	i didn't like it that much. but for 89 cent it was all right.
1	I did not request or order this song, I do not know how it appear in my account but I was glad when given the opportunity to rate it.  What you hear over and over will eventually pentrate your heart and what is in your heart will fuel your behavior, actions and speech. Look at the condition of the world today and the music that is being made. You have the power to guard your heart.
1	To whom it may concern, I have been buying from Amaon MP3 for quite some time now. This is the first time I did not get a complete recording of the song I was purchasing, The only other trouble I've had is a song just appearing on my list. Never heard of it or the artist. So, that is why I think I might try someone else for this particular song. Sorry guys, just saying the truth.  Kathy
1	There honestly is no question about the lack of great songs on the radio out there. For Mariah Carey, she honestly has had a lot of lackluster songs that have really been in place on the radio. With the less-than-appealing scale of E=MC2, Mariah tries to deliver a darker song that loses its way heart and soul to the strength of what Mariah should honestly do. That is definitely the case with her latest single Obsessed, the first from her upcoming album Memoris Of An Imperfect Angel. The song is a far departure from the more upbeat and driven songs Mariah had been known for delivering. It really was made in regards against rapper Eminem for targeting Mariah and her husband Nick Cannon and their relationship. It honestly doesn't feel like a actual beef between the two of them, nor does Mariah score the way she used to. If you really must know, I enjoyed Whitney Houston's title track to her upcoming album I Look To You 10x more, and I absolutely recommend that as a must buy for your MP3 player over Obsessed. Mariah really needs to find better material for her music, otherwise she could windup having a huge flop on her hands. We'll see when Memoris Of An Imprefect Angel comes out in late September.  Song: D-
1	This track is terrible! So bad that I exchanged it because I thought I must have gotten a poor digital copy. But the next one I downloaded was just as bad. You can hear the artist singing (albeit, quietly) throughout the track. At the point when you're supposed to be singing with a choir, it goes totally silent. I still used it for my brother's wedding because we didn't have an accompanist (and even if we didn't, it was outdoor and there was no space for a keyboard/piano!). It gave kind of a cool effect to have an unaccompanied solo at that point, but still would not have been my preference. Not sure that this product should even be sold, ESPECIALLY the way it's marketed!
1	Miss Taylor Swift, yes most of us have wished for you to change your sound. Whether it be a little more pop, or a little more country, we still asked. Some got tired of the usual stuff, some didn't mind and loved it.  I love your old music. I love the curly hair and the clothes you wore, and the music videos that were made. I still love you as a person and an artist.  I'm only giving this album: one star.  ONLY because I do adore 'Begin Again'. That is the only song on here that even remotely reminds me of your old albums. I'm happy you wanted to change up your style, that's cool. Everyone does it. But to lose yourself entirely into other genres that just don't work with your sound, is horrible. I feel like you changed your sound completely for more fans. Maybe you should have thought about the fans you already have instead of trying to get everyone else on board.  I kept wanting to skip tracks just to find that old Taylor Swift, that old sound of yours that everyone loved or still does.  Yeah some people like or love your new album but this one just doesn't cut it for me.  I'm still a fan of yours and will probably go to one of your concerts next year, but I won't be listening to this album again anytime soon.  From a fan with an honest opinion.
1	Jonah Hex Movie Review Jonah Hex; gunslinger, bounty hunter and outlaw. The DC Comic Book classic recently turned motion picture; chronicles the life of Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin). Directed by Jimmy Hayward, (Horton Hears a Who), Jonah Hex details one man's life after his run in with psycho General Quentin Turnbull, (John Malkovich). Quentin blames Jonah Hex for the death of his son, and in-turn enacts revenge on him by brutally slaying Jonah's wife and son. Jonah immediately swears revenge and dedicates his life to dishing out justice as he sees fit. Good or bad, Jonah is forced by the government to help fight General Quentin, who has stolen secret government weapons. The movie which is only 83 minutes long, (including credits) failed to deliver a storyline that will keep fans of this supernatural western comic book hooked for years. Not only because the original Jonah character has been filed down and drastically changed; but this movie is short, confusing, and very hard to follow. I was very disappointed in this comic book adaptation; it would have been nice to see Jonah Hex follow in the footsteps of other DC Comic book greats such as, Superman, Batman and Wonder woman.
1	I am not satisfied with this purchase because it states that the product is an audio CD. I received a record of their music, which isn't what I paid for. How do you get those two mixed up? Or why doesn't it say that the product was a record, not an audio CD. Ridiculous...
1	The vinyl pressing we purchased was poor quality. The album skipped on both sides so it was returned. It seems like there might be an issue with the manufacturer after reading other reviews. It's a great album otherwise.
1	My daughter listens to a clean version on the radio but we were unaware the download version is not the same and is not appropriate for kids.  I just threw away a buck since I had to delete it as soon as I listened to the downloaded version.  Since Amazon doesn't have the clean version, I will have to buy it elsewhere.
1	Good!! Thank you
1	The song only play halfway through.
1	Although the beat and rhythm are cool, the words trash the song. I dumped it. Next time I'll read the lyrics before purchasing a song like this. Hated it!!!!!!    Kevin J.
1	I got one of rick rosses mix tapes rozzay and it was really good. This is not. I really only like one song "im not a star". Below average cd from a good rapper.
1	I like it but not the best I have heard
1	Who do these kids think they are?  The Beastie Boys?  Not hardly.  The Beastie Boys are talented and unique, this band is so ordinary and radio friendly it makes me ill. Sounds sorta like it should be the soundtrack for a teen movie or something.  For god's sake, please don't buy it.
1	This damn thing is only 30 seconds long and i had to buy it twice this was total BS don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!  :(
1	Lady Garbage is more like it.  If i play Express Yourself at the same time as this, i only hear 1 song.  Sad
1	I like this song, but $1.29 is a THIRTY PERCENT increase in the price of music.  REFUSE TO PAY for these over-priced songs!  There are plenty still available at $0.99.  Tell the record companies WE WILL NOT PAY MORE!  Hey, Kings of Leon, you are getting ripped off by your record company!
1	You are supposed to be a reputable company yet, NOTHING in the description of this item tells the buyer that this is NOT Adam Lambert.  It's not until you get to the reviews that you learn the horrid truth.  Is the economy so tight that you now have to LIE to us to get more money?  That's a quick way to bankruptcy.  You need to put a disclaimer up front instead of trying to misrepresent an item to make a few extra bucks.
1	This was a disappointment.
1	I purchased 5 or 6 Super Audio Cds at the Holidays for my wife.....This was the only cd that would NOT play...I have many cd players..tried 'em all..The cd player in her Acura likewise did not play this cd....Interesting format.....
1	I  bought the download Antonio Vivaldi: Guitar Concerto in D major Largo - solo classic off this album.  Unfortunately, it is only a partial song.
1	How do I know if I like it or not?  I don't have a record player.  My fault... I think somewhere it must have said it was a record not a CD.  Ya I feel like an idiot.  But I'm still out the money.  So, thanks a lot Amazon!
1	Can't believe I bought this.  Must have had my account hacked
1	songs are disappointing
1	The music was good, but several of the tracks either skipped or would not play.  I tried it on a different player with the same results. I am going to return it.
1	What a travesty!  A great talent ruined by poor advice and horrible arrangements.  Please, please get this young man to someone who understands that yelling and theatrics is not music.  Someone rescue this guy
1	They are trying way too hard in this effort to be abstract and conceptual but it falls flat this time. I love that the Deftones experiment with their sound because they are good enough that they pull it off most of the time and it works for them; it just doesn't work on Gore.
1	If i had a bit more of the review I could tell you if this is what I want, This entire music DRM protected business is passe'. I am a computer manager, but my 20-something year-old employees could get me the entire album on a coffee break; for free. I, trying to keep the recording industry afloat, cannot hear enough of the preview on a classical music piece to determine if that's what I want to buy, or not. RIAA and all you record companies - you are doomed!
1	This is not a real Igor Krutoy album. Disc 1 is exactly from his 2004 release "The Best", but Disc 2 is a collection of some of his hits from 2004 and other songs not written by him. This is a typical Russian bootleg mix.
1	All of the reviews here are copied from the CD reviews of "Insect Trust" a CD with entirely different songs listed, probably by an entirely different artist. This is  simply "Insect." Didn't know where else to report this or ask about it. If I'm off base here, then someone at Amazon should delete my post and explain the differences. Hope my one star doesn't skew things too much.
1	Tha Carter III Volume 1 Vinyl only has 8 songs.  I was looking to play let the beat build and it is not on this one.  WTF mane??  How can you sell a vinyl with half of the album and not have that somewhere on the description??  A Milli is bangin
1	Unfortunately, I cannot download  this song onto my itunes so I need to go through Amazon's music each time I want to listen to this song. Otherwise, the song is absolutely wonderful to dance to, my husband and I dance the rhumba to this great song.
1	Unfortunately, regurgitated riffs and progressions! Nothing new here. Landreth is capable of much better than this. Boring and very disappointing.
1	One of the worst albums of all time from one of the worst bands of all time. That's all I have to say...
1	Don Johnson was at the height of his Miami Vice fame when he released his Heartbeat album in 1986.  The title shot into the top ten peaking at number five almost entirely on his massive popularity on the show.  The song is a paint by the numbers power rocker.  Mr. Johnson has a passable voice, but the song is so generic and mundane, that it never rises above ho-hum.
1	I am Arminta & I have no approved this or put this up. I will be contacting Amazon to get all my old music &'photos I absolutely done want anyone to have!
1	In 1963 some folks had the idea of turning the source material of the film The Blue Angel into a musical.  From here everything went wrong.  They reset the thing in New Orleans, they brought in Duke Ellington to do the music (he had no background in musical theater) Marshall Baerer to the lyrics (not bad on paper, he had done Once Upon a Matress a few years earlier), Lilo (she of Can Can 10 years earlier) and Theodore Bikel who while a fine performer had only had a minor personal success in the mega hit The Sound of Music as the leads.  None of this came together and the thing limped into New York for 3 forgettable performances.  I don't even hear a lot of the older theater mavens claiming to have seen this train wreck as they do Carrie and Kelley.  But with songs by Duke Ellington people kept wanting to hear the score and Ellis Larkins put this package together with Marshall Baerer and Barbara Lea sharing the vocal chores.  I am unable to tell if the songs are dull or the fault lies with the singers, neither of whome brings any real sparkle to the task.  Larkins at least does a competant job, but the whole package is deadly.  I can't even imagine playing through the whole thing again, not one song jumped out at me, and I am a huge fan of the Ellington ouvre.  Dull, Dull, Dull.
1	This DVD-Audio disc is supposed to be recorded as DTS 96/24. Neither my OPPO DVD-Audio player nor my Denon DVD player can find any DTS encoded track on this disc.  Otherwise to review this disc on its merits, to me it sounds like it was mastered or composed using "garage band" on an Apple Mac and then converted to lossy MP3. It's awful.  Giving it 1-star is an over-rating, if zero was an option then that is what it would get. My copy of this disc is being returned.
1	Ok performance, good sound quality, but not essential.
1	I'm sorry but this album was a yawn for me.  I have listened twice and find it to be simply boring.  LSG they will never be if that was the 'winning' formula they were going for.  Love Tyrese and Ginuwine, never been a fan of Tank, but not good as a group to me.
1	im not sure what the deal is, but i download this thing and its in some unrecognizeable format, filename is like 50 characters long, pure jibberish. what a waste of money.
1	i didn't get the allmans i got the wrong thing instead i got the platters im not happy whats wrong with theses people
1	Would not download,never received.
1	They edited out the best part.  Almost asked for my .39 back.  Poor quality too.
1	I purchased the song because I wanted to hear it with both Bryan May and Luciano Pavarotti...and Pavarotti doesn't sing it!
1	Did not really care for this collection, which I got for free. It was a realistically boring collections of stuff.
1	Like many other people I became interested after hearing the album opener, "Undead".  However, the first track is the only decent one on the album.  The following tracks aren't even mediocre.  Hollywood Undead sound like the love-child of Kottonmouth Kings and Slipknot if the love-child was abused by "Results May Vary"-era Limp Bizkit.  They try to be rap-metal with a slightly more hip-hop edge and manage to fail at both.  The music sounds generic and the lyrics sound like they were written by frat boys with rock star pipe dreams, and might have been edgy in 1996.  The masks and kooky/mysterious names and other banal theatrics are just thrown at the listener to distract them from how crappy this band truly is.  Listen to the first song from someone who wasted the money on the album.
1	Joan Baez has a remarkable voice known for the ballad singing she has done for years but ... somehow this sounded like all the other Joan Baez ballad type songs and its remarkable timeless spirit was lost ....
1	AGAIN,  I bought a song to download to my MP3 but it goes to cloud and then I can't get it downloaded to my player.  WHY can't I just buy and download directly to my device??????  I will never buy music from Amazon again!
1	Not much different than the first Speed Sleep, however the recording is terrible. The voice is muffled and its difficult to understand what is being said.
1	Only received partial of the song
1	OK, let's assume you know nothing whatsoever about Hank Marvin or the Shadows.  Then you might find some of this interesting, some not.  But if you do happen to be a Marvin fan, you'll either think it's no big deal or find some of it just terrible. Tony Iommi bludgeon's the crap out of "Wonderful Land," a song that was originally great because of it's wistful, airy atmosphere and lovely melody. Here, those qualities are trashed. Iommi may be a master at what he does, but it doesn't work here at all as far as i'm concerned. Same with Brian May's "FBI". The original was a jaunty toe tapper, ultra catchy with a tick-tock beat and a wonderful muted guitar. Brian May is a great guitarist but his version of this song kills what was fun about the original for me. ANd that's pretty much the whole story. Even the tracks that do work, like Peter Green's, aren't so great that you'd think "Gee, this is the way the original SHOULD have been played."  Don't get me wrong, i don't think any band's songbook is sacred.  But why bother to buy this when  a Shadows' greatest hits - even a mediocre one - will give you far, far better versions of these songs. And by "better," i mean versions that bring the melody and song to live in the most genuine way.
1	Nicole Atkins' 2014 release pales beside earlier albums like Neptune City and Mondo Amore.  My wife's comment was "bubblegum", which you certainly couldn't say about earlier efforts.  There was a sameness about the songs as well.  This one goes on the block and I'll look forward to Atkins' next effort.
1	Not good.  For some reason when I watched the movie the music seemed better. My order was received on time, etc. so that was no problem but the content of the CD was disappointing.
1	I paid for this song and i don't even know where it  was saved to
1	crawl back into obscurity...PLEASE!!! No one likes likes this band. Do they? It was s$$$ back then And is still S$$$ now. Get a job at guitar center. Really!!! F.E.A.R!
1	song
1	I want the real soundtrack .
1	What a sorry, ill-produced excuse for a compilation. It looks eclectic but is just a mess. It starts with a bunch of noise and proceeds to never finds a flow. Songs jarr from one to the next with poor volume regulation, making for terrible background music - ironic as having it on during gatherings is generally the idea behind a christmas compilation. Many tunes seem like cheap b-sides that EMI probaby used at no cost. Even some of the songs with famous singers are lame, including the cheesiest rendition ever of "baby it's cold outside" featuring Dean Martin which isn't a patch on the Johnny Mercer/Margaret Whiting version. Then there's the ill-chosen Leonard Cohen "hallelujah" (a song I admire but not in this context); music producers seem to think people will be tricked into believing is a christmas song because it has the world hallelujah in it!
1	Another group firmly entrenched in the corporate country craze sweeping o'er the airwaves. It's hard to keep track of all these groups because they look and sound so much alike. It's just that some may, or may not be, slightly more genuine and real than others. These songs sound like the same songs we've been fed many times before, just re-hashed and re-cashed. Download the couple MP3s you like and skip the rest.
1	I give this one star because I had to give it something to write the review. If you want this much noise in your life, something is radically wrong.
1	Sorry, Jerry Lee, time for you to hang it up
1	Good Songs with Good beats remixed with mostly bad or at least worse beats, kind of like Nu-Mixx Klassiz.  It's really nothing worth spending your money on, baby don't cry get's remixed with Black Eyed Peas' where the love is the only song I can play without puke...  It's bad quality on the remixes, I guess that's why they didn't get the Outlawz to rap some new raps on it, how they got Jadakiss and Busta is beyond imagination.  Crap....
1	Before Outkast, Before The Geto Boys, Before Arrested Development, there was 8 Ball & M.J.G...the souths premire rappers and some of the greatest southern Mc's to ever grace the world of Hip Hop music. And while Ball and G may be legends thier new cd is anything but legendary, and there is one reason for that...Bad Boy Records. Bad Boy and Ball and G are so different from each other that when combining MJG's southern drawl and 8 Ball's Graspy Hardcore rhyming with Crunk beats it fails miserabaly and leaves with dissapointment:  1. Album Intro-N/A  2. You Don't Want Drama-B+(2nd Best Song On CD)  3. Straight Cadillac Pimpin-B  4. We Do It-C  5. The Streets-C+  6. Mad Rapper-N/A  7. Shot Off-F  8. When It's On-C  9. Trying To Get At You-C+  10. Baby Girl-C+  11. Get A Kit-N/A  12. Forever-B+(3rd Best Song On CD)  13. Look At The Grillz-C+  14. Living Legends-N/A  15. Don't Make-B-  16. Memphis City Blues-B-  17. Gangsta-B+  18. Confessions-A-(Best Song On CD)
1	was looking for another title
1	Pure, unadulterated GARBAGE! This is the kind of art you'd hear through a Chinese bathroom stall at 3 AM, terrible.
1	Good
1	I will be the dissenting voice amid all the kudos thrown at this album.  Make no mistake - I am a BoDeans fan, and I know they can crank out catchy, heartland rock like no one else. Unfortunately, this album only has flashes of future brightness.  While the music is "good", it's not great. When you consider that this album came out in the late 80s, it is a miracle that it was released - the influence of simple, catchy songs from the late 50s and early 60s is unmistakable, and really went against the grain of overproduced, synth-based music of the release year. While the music is fun and solid, it fails to rise above that - never enters the "great" zone, that leaves you humming a riff or intro for the next few days, nor do you want to crank you car volume to 11. However, what ruins the album for me - and yes, "ruins" is correct - are the vocals. For whatever reason, Sam Llanas sings lead on most of the songs. I'd compare listening to his voice akin to scraping the inside of my skull with a fork, only less pleasant.  Sam's voice is extremely limited in range, as well as being quite nasal.  Kurt Neuman's voice - when it can be heard - is in fine form, and I wish he had sung lead on more of the songs. The siezure-inducing quality of Sam's voice is curious, because with later BoDeans albums, it's much better.  Either his voice become stronger, or their budget for production effects got bigger, or both. My recommendation:  skip it unless you find it cheap somewhere. Start with "Go Slow Down," "Black and White" or "Blend."  Those albums feature Sam and Kurt at the height of their writing and singing powers.
1	Without any doubt, this is one of the worst "interprations" of Mozart's late symphonies - both recordings, this one and the other one (Nos. 38 and 41), are beyond painful to listen to.  I am not kidding.  Firstly, and this I say with all sincerity, the sound is as perfect as it gets, the Freiburger Barockorchester demonstrates one of the most finely crafted performances - but the issue lies with the conductor, who has taken a work and butchered it to the point where I could not help myself but go back and listen to parts just to be sure I heard it right.  Jacobs clearly has no faith in the music itself because he feels the need to change things to his own liking, to the point where I think the essence of the music is lost beyond repair.  For example, tempi are chaotic (not creative or powerful), piano and forte are confused - I don't think he remembered what "crescendo" and "diminuendo" means in music (yes, I'm being cheeky, but seriously, you'll understand once you hear these performances).  I felt insulted as the listener to expect a "forte" instead getting a "whimper" - come on...at some point a conductor must maintain some professional decorum and show some respect to the music as printed on the paper in front of him.  The 40th symphony sounds like a comic opera - actually, not even that - it sounds like a divertimento.  I was disgusted by it, so much so that I listened to it a few times just to see if maybe I was "missing the point" - no, I was not missing the point at all.  Jacobs slapped me in the face with his vomit he dares to call a "fresh" interpretation.  Pardon me, but I have nothing against interprations (hence why I own mulitiple recordings of the same music), but this is not an interpretation, this is something else.  In any even, I gave it 2 stars, and those 2 stars it only received due to the first rate technical prowess of the Freiburger Barockorchester, and for the sound quality of the Harmonia Mundi label.  Other than that, Jacobs also costed this recording 3 stars.  Nothing to be proud of.  If you think you'll be getting the usual "superb Jacobs" here, well, you won't ... you'll be getting a Jacobs you never knew was possible.  I was floored, and not in a good way. Thanks for reading this.  Cheers!
1	Awful material. Only like 3 songs, two of them being singles. She annoys me for some reason. Her singing is okay, nothing really fancy. I don't get the hype with her! Really I don't!!!   2 deserved stars. 
1	Nothing sells a CD any faster than a listing of the tracks on the CD, and if possible sound samples.  I for one would never purchase a CD not knowing what was on it.  Money is hard to come by nowadays.  Why gamble on ordering something that may not be worth the money?  I am also a big stickler for original recordings.  New versions of the original hits by the original artists just doesn't cut it!  People like original recordings by the original artists.  With the price of this CD it is very possible that it isn't worth the price.  Merchant should list the songs included on the CD, and specify if they are the original hits.  Why be deceitful, and dishonest?
1	This is John Mayer doing country -- and it just doesn't work.  I was disappointed, as I love all of John Mayer's other work.
1	The song download with in and out audio quality Very,very poor sound !!!!! I want my money back!!! You should check it out!!
1	This was probably a fun show to attend. But for a live recording I think the mighty Van Halen is capable of so much more. Dave, I know you are an entertainer first and foremost, and you're damn good at it. But for a live recording coming in on time, in key, and without that silly operatic vibrato would have made this listenable.
1	This is the original German version and should be noted as such.  Guess I should have listened to the 30 second sample first.
1	This is important, please read.  There are presently two links to download the Interstellar Fugitives.  This one has 15 tracks, but all the music is wrong.  It's all really dodgy smooth jazz house, like the kind of stuff Moodyman would make if he sucked.  The other URI is http://www.amazon.com/Intersteller-Fugitives/dp/B000QZWO8U  This has the correct music, but is missing several tracks.  As of January 16, 2008, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this album as a MP3 download from Amazon until they have the entire, correct album.  Be sure to listen to the excerpts before purchasing, to be sure.  Anyway, I've already advised Amazon, so with hope, they'll fix it soon.  That said, I'd give the real album four stars.
1	Listened to this for about 10 minutes but couldn't get past the part where he is describing depression in excessive detail.  I already know how depression feels and don't need someone reinforcing all that.  Not impressed at all.
1	The cassette was old and wouldn't play right.
1	Let me start off by saying that I will give my personal opinion about this album and the band and that no one has to agree. To add to that, I really like Flyleaf. I liked them when they first started getting popular, which was back in 2005 I believe. Since listening to their first album and loving their songs, I was eager for them to come out with a second. The songs in their first album are just the right dose of everything, religion mixed with doubt, struggles, being angry, and upset. I was a Christian then so some of their songs that mentioned God I could relate to. Well, even after becoming Agnostic and Atheist I still liked their songs. Even if some of them were about God or something spiritual it wasn't like it was this "push in your face" kind of lyrics. They were simply nice and great lyrics.  With Memento Mori, I can't say the same. Yes, if you're Christian or even remotely religious, no doubt you will like this new album. But for the fans that were there at the beginning with the band, and for the ones that aren't necessarily into the whole religious thing, will easiliy shake their heads at the CD. I did listen to every song, and out of all of them I only like two: Again and Tiny Heart. Tiny Heart was actually a song I have listened to for a year or more because Flyleaf had it released out on some websites. I can say that I like their old version better because they changed the lyrics to it for the new album. Still, it sounds nice. The rest of the songs..can't say I care for them too much.  This album seemed to take a transition from their last. They seemed to go from "and every choice you make will affect you, search your own self" to "See them surrender, spread out your open hands and he will raise you up,spread out your open hands admit you've held them shut,be swept away by this". Having said this, the transition affects a lot of their fans that don't see it in that way. Compared to the first line on their first album, this second line seems more pushy and "in your face".  Within listening to half the CD, I kind of felt like I was being preached to. Instead of really hearing lyrics, some of the songs sounded like a preachy sermon. The songs were repetitive. When you talk about one thing, such as God and the Christianity surrounding it, there is no room for anything else. The song Missing was a bit different but it still followed the same aspect. After hearing the other songs talk about God or Christ it isn't hard to figure that Missing is talking about needing Christ. Actually, all of them seem to be about that.  -Beautiful Bride - Anyone who follows or who has followed Christianity should know that "bride" = body of Christ. It talks about it in the bible. So when the lyrics talk about this and "one flesh abiding", that is more than enough to know how this album will be, after listening to the first song.  -Again - This was the band's single and was playing on the radio before the album's release. It's catchy and nice and I do like it. I think it's more of the vocals and music that appealed to me than the lyrics. With Flyleaf, unless you just listen to the lyrics all the time or read them while listening, it's hard to really understand. You know how you'll like a song but not really get the meaning until after reading the lyrics? Yeah. But, it's still a good song, great lyrics.  -Chasm - I didn't really like this one. It reminded me of something I used to hear at church on sunday morning. "So thirsty" = being thirsty for God. I can't relate.  -The Kind - kind of pissed me off when I listened to it and read the lyrics. What I got from this song was basically.. "you keep sinning and cutting off God from your life and everything you do wrong sets you apart more and more". And then, somewhere in the middle of the song I hear "Okay well you've got it wrong cause' you can't serve God and money. You can serve one or the other", which is basically the rinse and repeat of typical Christians. When Lacey said that it just sort of ticked me off a bit. First off, this isn't the only song that there is dialogue in - I personally hate when people talk in songs and I know a lot of others do too. Second, she's talking about you can't serve God and money, but like one reviewer was saying earlier, the band obviously released two different CD's. They also released another version of their first CD last year, with 5 acoustic songs and a couple of music videos. They're always dressed in something new and they constantly tour. Lacey seems to have her hair dyed or cut in a different way almost every few months or so. And yet you're telling me and everyone else I can't serve God and money? I'm not saying they're hypocrites, but when it comes to a mainstream band that basically seems to have it all, like other money guzzlers in the music industry, it's hard to see any kind of meaning behind that line in a song. Lacey has clothes that don't look inexpensive and let's not forget the tattoos she has. I'm not saying that Christians aren't allowed to do stuff like that with their money but it just sounds hypocritical. I mean, let's face it, Lacey and the band makes more money than I or probably any reviewer on here does and she is able to get a lot of nice clothes and tattoos, something I long to do but can't because of not having enough money.  -In the Dark - I like the beginning of this song but then she turns it yet again into something about Jesus. I do like the lyrics though, and the screaming in the background.  -Set Apart This World - What I got from this song was that it was about heaven. I didn't really like it, not that it was about that, but I just didn't like it. Just wasn't anything special.  -Swept Away - I really didn't like this song. The beginning was really weird. She sounded like a rabid dog. It sort of made me laugh. And yet again it was like another Christian propaganda.  -Tiny Heart - I liked the earlier version of this song before it was revised and put on the album. And the beginning sounds great but when she starts the chorus it sounds dumb because she changed the lyrics. Too repetitive, got spoiled on the older version. It was better. But the music sounds good.  -Treasure - Hated this one too, mostly because of the beginning. I absolutely hate dialogue in songs, so the beginning made me laugh. Nice tune but couldn't relate.  I know what I must sound like. The typical Atheist who doesn't like Christian music. Well, I don't like Christian music, mostly because I can't relate. But that doesn't mean that the lyrics or music isn't good. Flyleaf went from mainstream heavy metal to a sort of full Christian popish sound. So yeah, it is a bit disappointing to the fans that aren't into the whole Christian scene. Like one reviewer on here said, it was like they wanted to get into the mainstream music and then release their true colors after they had everyone hooked. A bit deceiving if you see it in that way. If you're a Christian then you will most likely like this CD and I think that's great. But just from my own standpoint, I was disappointed. It just all sounded like Christian propaganda to me, and it's going to sound different to me because I'm not Christian.  So just know, before anyone leaves any kind of comments (because I'm sure some will), just know that I am in no way knocking Christians or their beliefs or Flyleaf. I have an opinion too and this was it.
1	ok
1	Not as good as I thought.
1	this audio track consists primarily of the author reading a list of emotion words.  Was not that useful to me.
1	I don't really hate the Music Sampler - I hate it because I don't have any equipment to download it.
1	Sounds eerily familiar to the Ren & Stimpy Classic Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy.  Basically it is nonstop repetitive gibberish.  Hello, boys and girls This is a song about being happy That's right, it's the happy, happy, joy, joy, song  Happy, happy, joy, joy Happy, happy, joy, joy Happy, happy, joy, joy Happy, happy, joy, joy Happy, happy, joy, joy Happy, happy, joy, joy Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy  (repeat 100 more times and you get the idea)
1	Reminds me of George Michael 1985 Excellent for playlist
1	If you're going to keep out the explicit lyrics, there's no need to half-spell them in the lyrics shown. My 9 year old was really disappointed in the senseless cussing.
1	Nothing wrong with the song but I haven't heard it yet. I've tried to download 2 different songs from Amazon but none of them downloaded. When I get time I'll need to try to email Amazon to see what's up. Their instruction on downloads are pretty much worthless. I'm going to iTunes for all other downloads then convert the song to MP3.
1	It seems as though the full recording for each lesson is cut short or not fully added, which makes for a confusing recording. I wish I had the real records for this.
1	"Shotgun Wedding" featured 3 tracks not available anywhere else - they were what made this compilation worth getting:  Psychedelic Super Jesus (The Buzzsaw Mix) Time (The 12 Gauge Mix) Hired Gun (The Anvil Mix)  The MP3 download here replaces those three unique tracks with the vanilla versions pulled from other albums - ABSOLUTELY NOT COOL if you're actually trying to buy the "Shotgun Wedding" album as it was released.
1	It was a sign of how far Australia has come when they voted Guy Sebastian the winner of Australian Idol over this "Aussie Bloke". Whilst I don't have an issue with the kind of person Shannon seems to be, or the fact that his blend of Aussie-Country-Rock has it's fans, it is insulting to the Australian public and the talent of Guy to list this CD as the Australian Idol Winner (with or without a question mark). If you want some standard Aussie country rock, and aren't too fussed with pitch, diction or tone - buy this album. If not, and you want to experience the best that Australia has to offer - buy Guy Sebastian's "Just As I Am" (which can also be purchased through Amazon.
1	If I knew this was going to be in spanish I wouldn't  have bought it,I don't understand what he's saying
1	my fault....not what I thought. Not the best recording.....stick with the original Apple release.....and why is there a quota of words for this review..?
1	Can I give this no stars?  The train wreck that has become the once mighty Van Halen is fully represented here for you ears! Eddie and Alex Van Halen are still great musicians, there is no denying that.  David Lee Roth has fallen far and hard, no longer singing and forgetting words!  The only reason Wolfgang is there is because he is Eddie's son, he does not provide the background vocals nor the great bass playing of Michael Anthony. Yea, this is the original singer of Van Halen... blah, blah, blah.  Do yourself a favor and get the Sammy Hagar and the Circle live cd instead.  Sammy has not lost a step and has a great band consisting of Vic Johnson, Michael Anthoney (yea same great backup vocals and bass, and the incredible Jason Bonham.  They do a few of the "Van Hagar" songs and do them very well!
1	VERY NICE  I DID RECEIVE IN 2 DAYS GREAT
1	My dad said that I need to kiss you
1	hated the song
1	Why do they call this the Keeper of the Seven Keys legacy if The Keeper of The Seven Keys song is not on it pretty dumb if you ask me.
1	This dance band gets one star for copying the name of one of the best indie bands from the 80's.  Do not buy this album if you are looking for the Peter Case band.
1	I have been following this Band since they were under the Name of Sugar Daddy Superstar. If you are looking for a sound with an edge similar to Crossfade's AKA Sugar Daddy Superstar's first CD's you are out of luck and will be extremely disappointed! There are several songs worth listening too, but nothing that rocks nearly as hard as the first debut CD. This CD will not likely get any play on the harder rock stations. The Crossfade CD sounds more like another pop sell out like Nickelback.  Crossfade has really lost the very original sound of their first CD.  On the other there are several songs of honorable mention, Breathing slowly and Washing the world away. Even the more mellow songs have a different feel and sound to them.  The more you listen to the CD the more it will grow on you.  The loss of the back ground vocal sounds of the last CD is a huge loss. It has had a vast change to the Sound of Crossfade.
1	If you're going to give a song away to generate interest in a new service I would advise you to use one that doesn't suck eggs.
1	Doesn't have anything that grips my attention, and it is simply run of the mill.  I begin to feel like he is whining.
1	It's marketed as a set of 5, but I only received 1. It was cheap, but still it's false advertising.
1	Left for dead and resurrected by Indian magic, Jonah Hex ( Josh Brolin) is a disfigured bounty hunter who can communicate with corpses.  He accepts a charge from the US government to track down the man who murdered his family (John Malkovich), a Confederate general who plans to destroy the nation's capitol with a super-weapon.  I haven't seen a movie this bad in a long time.  Apparently, director Jimmy Heyward and screenwriters Neveldine & Taylor strung together a bunch of stupid ideas that they thought were cool, tacked on an overpowering and totally inappropriate soundtrack, and didn't worry too much about tying it all together with a cohesive story.  The supernatural aspects of the story provided glimpses of what could have made this movie more than just a dismal Western, but Hex's ability to communicate with the dead was treated as nothing more than a convenient plot point to get him where he needed to be for another dull shootout.  I've never read any of the comics, but I know the character has been around for a long time.  A quick look at the Wikipedia entry shows that this film bears little resemblance to the published origin story.  Looks like another case of Hollywood hacks thinking their own lame ideas are superior to their source material.
1	i haven't heard every song from this album, but i have just one thing to say "what happened to the country bumpkin that we all fell in love with." i much prefer the days when Jewel was still doing Pieces of You and even Spirit. but this new deal she's got going on, i don't know. i really don't like how she's changed to another one of those manufactured pop girls. it's just horrible. Jewel what happened!?
1	I downloaded an "amz" file for this recordihng. When I dropped this file into Amazon downloader, I was told the file expired. Yet it is still be offered on Amazon - WHAT A BIG RIP-OFF!!!!!
1	No lyrics show when playing on karaoke machine.
1	More New Age bombastic, pseudo-poetic pianism.  Limbaugh---and I love relative Rush!---is obviously an anglicized German name: Lindbach, which means "gentle brook!"  Figuratevi!
1	I'm a big fan of kasabians previous work. They're first album and their last one (velociraptor ). I'm not feeling this one.
1	I am a firm believer in giving artists second chances case in point Chrisette Michele . Her last cd left me questioning whether to invest in her work again when previous cd before that was BANGIN . I'm not sure who to point fingers at the label, her producers , the marketing team or the artist. Without a doubt she's beautiful , talented , humble and can belt out a tune or two I'm just not sure what exactly went wrong on this third cd. Out of the entire song selections I can only bare 3 songs to listen to . I understand artists don't want to be forgotten so they get pressure from their labels to drop product, but how about taking the time to get a strong team behind you in every aspect of your career consumers and music lovers such as myself get a little disappointed when artists go from great to garbage. Crossing over to style that isn't yours naturally just to sell music isn't a good move .
1	I was disappointed in this CD.  I wish I had had the opportunity to hear some of the songs before I ordered it.  And I am a big fan of Mannheim Steamroller!
1	It's okay if artists want to change their sound sometimes, if they didn't they might get bored. But this album is awful. Notice how she never did pop again?
1	Listen to the intro to "Peace of Mind" by Boston, then the intro to "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by this awful group of Talent-Less losers. Tell me you don't hear an odd similarity  KURT COMPLAIN IS WORTHLESS  get Appetite for Destruction by Guns N Roses instead of this god-awful waste of a compact disc
1	I don't know why people use the term 'surf' if it's not surf music? This is NOT surf music of ANY kind.
1	he reviews lead me to beleive that these songs were all gems. The truth is they are all second and third rate, and do not reflect her work.
1	I will presume that anyone who has found his or her way to a page for rare live recordings of Michelangeli playing Beethoven and Schumann, needs no education on Michelangeli, Beethoven, or Schumann, and knows why this disc might seem a desirable buy. Alas, this is the sort of release that gives "unofficial" recordings and labels a bad name -- it would be a poor value at more than a dollar. (By the way, is that artwork and color scheme an attempt to fool the extremely myopic into thinking they're buying a DG release, I wonder?)  The transfer of the Beethoven concerto is ghastly. The distortion of the piano tone is so bad (getting worse as the piece progresses) that it sounds as though the instrument is actually veering wide of pitch. ABM held at gunpoint would not have sat down and begun a performance on an instrument that sounded remotely like this. I consider myself to have an above-average tolerance for "historical" sound, but I made it through three movements of this only with difficulty. The Schumann is not such a trial on the nerves, but -- unbelievably -- someone's ineptitude has resulted in a sizable cut and clumsy splice in the first-movement exposition that shaves nearly a minute off of that movement's running time.  I have been reliably informed that this same performance of the Schumann (cond. Gavazzeni) is available elsewhere without the first-movement butchery, and that more listenable transfers of the Beethoven (cond. Freccia) also are in circulation. Michelangeli can be heard in other performances of both pieces, too. For starters, of course, there is his very beautiful late "Emperor" with Giulini on DG, and a more interestingly conducted and better-played (by the orchestra) Schumann conducted by Hermann Scherchen (1956, various labels; the excellent transfer I have is on a label called "AS Disc"), which I believe to be one of the essentials for anyone interested in either ABM or the Schumann concerto. Only the most desperate and choice-deprived completist need bother with this.
1	Tried playing a song but does not work. Amazon Prime Music apparently isn't ready for Prime Time. So I guess I am not signed up for prizes. What a joke.
1	Great muscians, lots of talent. But, it was really hard to like the songs. They're certainly unique, but not my cup of tea.
1	I have to download your app before I can download this album? No thanks, you can keep it......
1	This is a short edit, with the middle third (the best part) missing.  I want my money back.
1	This CD has exactly 20 minutes on it!  I know it is level 1, but I expected a bit of a challenge.  I am more than mature and not in very good shape.  Most of the 20 minutes is 2mph or below with a peak of 3mph for probably less than a minute.  And the music?  I'm not picky.  Anything upbeat would have been fine, but this feels like a cocktail lounge from the 50s.  It does time a 20 min workout nicely, but I doubt I can tolerate the music day after day.  And it does keep my mind engaged to override the relaxed pace.  If you can tolerate the slow jazz and are looking for a really easy pace and don't mind paying full price for shipping (The actual price of the CD if it was shipped for free would have been okay) for 20 min, then you may be happier with this than I.
1	I really like the studio version, and can't seem to find it anywhere.  If you are expecting the version you enjoy from the movie, forget it.  The majority of it is a bunch of stupid dogs barking at the end.  VERY disappointing.
1	I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.
1	Slaughterhouse's 2nd release is a big disapointment for those who actually enjoy the group. I knew "Our House"'d be garbage but still I'm impressed how bad it is. The beat selection is so awful I didn't even care about the lyrics...they trying to go mainstream, play some songs on the radio, that's fine with me but the least they should do is drop a decent album...20 tracks deep and I got the impression I've listened the same song over and over.  Point blank: if you really enjoied this garbage either you have bad taste in rap or you're a groupie/sucker who doesn't know anything about the genre...GTFOH!!!!!
1	I love Elvis but there are so many songs on here that I have never heard and I am in my mid 50's.....
1	With a very soothing voice I thought I would drift off immediately to sleep. You are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace. When her voice leaves you assumably asleep for 20 minutes you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that  sounds more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire. The sound of the wind is also provided and has a similar effect as the fire in the fireplace. Fortunately it was only a 99 cent wasted expenditure. There are some good sleep aid recordings available but this is not one of them.
1	I would not consider this a CLEAN version. Wanted to use this for group exercise. Won't happen. So disappointed.
1	Beyonce should be ashamed of this.
1	Nice
1	Being a major fan of Mr. Sedaka, I invested in his latest effort.  What I got was a collection of songs filled with cliches.  Sedaka should not be writing his own lyrics.  He doesn't have a fresh idea in his head--but sadly, the same goes for this music.  Even his concerto is a collection of tired, overused musical phrases, which sound more like trunk tunes smashed together in this overblown boring piece.  There are leftover Greenfield collaborations but with all the ones he could choose from, he chose the most uninspired.  Too bad Mr. Greenfield is dead--he probably would have refined and crafted this album to a higher level. We certainly didn't need yet another recording of Laughter In the Rain & Breaking up Is Hard To Do.
1	Amazon gave me $3:00 and then charged me:(. They shouldn't give credits and then not honor it.  Please don't send me stuff that your not going to honor or it's impossible to use
1	Ok, but not what I expected it to be.
1	I never recreived this al bum--I  gues I AM JUST A DUMMY  at orddering things.
1	IT WAS A HOME-MADE CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was very disappointed in the quality. The packaging was terrible and I could have done a better job myself!
1	Excellent CD!! However, two of the songs will skip when it's played. Needs to be replaced. Other than that, it's fantastic!
1	I mean, it's a long classic rock song, so if you want to get your money worth for that lap dance at the local boob-bar, request this.  Otherwise, it's mediocre music from a grandstanding jackass and self-declared expert on a few things of which he is poorly informed.  "The Nuge" hasn't had an original thought in decades and reacts predictably to any ideas that challenge his worldview.
1	dull, raunchy and full of blubber. same ol', same ol' trash! Milions sold, and I don't know why. I mean, find real music that makes you smile and dance
1	This album its not the best one. I just liked 1 music. This album doesnt have musics like Silvia,My way, etc. I love camisa de venus remind me the old times, but I believe you should try another album.
1	Chad sounds like Bolton with that croaking baritone,over-singing style. My sister has this and It is the biggest garbage I ever heard. I cant stand the lead singer's singing. He wants to sound like Eddie Vedder or Layne Staley but comes of sounding like a grunge Michael Bolton. He wants to sound deep but the lyrics are one cliche after another. And the mid-tempo post-Creed grunge might be huge on Light FM but as a rock fan,It made me cringe.
1	I came across this collection in a store at a reasonably low price and was in such a hurry that I failed to notice the very small print on the back of the box that says these are "new stereo recordings."  It was only upon playing the CDs for the first time that I discovered that 22 of the 24 songs on these two discs are studio remakes, many of which are vastly differently from the original recordings.  Absolutely none of them could be mistaken for the original hits.  One track, "When I Need You" by Leo Sayer, is a live recording that's not too bad as far as live recordings go, but it's a song I never really cared for in the first place.  The only track noted to be an original recording, "Moonlight Feels Right" by Starbuck, isn't really the same as the album or single versions, but is a weird remix of the original recording from which a bit of the instrumentation seems to be missing, and in which a normally understated keyboard riff has been given a very prominent place way up front in the mix.  In fact, it's mixed louder than any other instrument and even higher than the vocals, and becomes so annoying--sort of like a car alarm continuously honking--that it's impossible to enjoy the song.  For me, this entire collection is worthless and makes me further appreciate what a great job a conscientious label like Rhino Records does when it repackages oldies, always with the original recordings and superb sound.  Buyer beware!
1	ya
1	I bought this song and two others (I ran & Wishing...) and they all suck. Don't sound like the original. I later found out these songs were re-recorded by the same singer/band, but they truly are awful. I was jogging and listening to this guy wailing and thought, this is terrible. It sounds like bad karaoke. Don't bother with this junk.
1	while I like the arrangement and the idea of this version, the main vocal is desperately melodramatic and ultimately ruins it..
1	Didn't know it was an LP very disappointed!!
1	The title says it all. Very disappointed the song wasn't marked as explicit. Made the song unsuitable to be listened to by mixed company. Too bad too, it was a great song.
1	It was fine really.  I purchased it because Iwanted to review the words and tune so that I could record it for myself  in memory of my sister Diane, who died last year.
1	The only lauding for this jingoistic song is that it was the first time an entertainer threw a public temper tantrum and virtually guaranteed they would have nothing more than a few latecomers to their agenda for a fan base. One of the most hatefully sold songs ever produced. This song along with their many and varied disingenuous claims of victim status pretty much nailed the lid on their career.
1	I love Pfunk but this is an older version of the song than I like.
1	Didn't work!
1	...this is what happens to your sisters when they listen too much Nirvana and Patti Smith. Is there nothing halfway original out there?
1	Don't hang it on me if that dude has no ears........and if he plays this in the company of wimmen, well, there goes Sex too....
1	Worked fine, at first....then didn't, deleted it from playlist, now... I don't have it!!!
1	Sometimes vinyl is better The entity that remastered this album did not consider continuity in volume (compression) between tracks, similarly within the tracks themselves some of Stans solos are way too loud. The sound (fidelity) is so very different (better) on vinyl.  Lesson learned, if you got the vinyl LPs of your favorite artist, there are MP3 turntables and receivers that will  clean-up your LP's and you can download them to your handy portable player or phone. Frame your LP's and hang them in your studio's basement or den walls. Skip this CD and record your own from other 'original' recording sources.
1	I really want to like this but can't. The first two albums I have are great but this falls short. The music is bland and I do not think I would have liked this band if this was their first album.
1	This is not the type of album I was expecting from Josh.  It lacked musicality and sentimentality.  This is so far out from his debut album.  Next time he releases an album, I will be a little more cautious...
1	While this CD has a lot of stories with various voices, it is not really dramatized. The readers are honestly a little boring.
1	Terrible recording!  The cricket sounds would be very nice except for the background static.  Maybe they figured we would call it "white noise", but if white noise is included with the recording, they should state it in the description.  All I wanted was CRICKETS!!!
1	only includes the paradise vinyl, not the entire album of born to die, very poorly advertised
1	really?  this metrosexual probably wouldn't know how to collect eggs from a henhouse and these fat girls think he is country?  I mean really?  seriously?  and he IS NOT GOOD LOOKING!
1	A lot of hard core Scorchers fans have been waiting forever for Still Standing to be re-released. Cd copys of the original are very hard to find. The extra cuts are always something to look forward to. So anyway I pop the cd in the player, start getting into Golden Ball & Chain and it's sounds like something's missing. I go back and listen again, and the guitar solo is gone!... As a Scorchers fan from almost the very beginning and a musician, that guitar solo is one of those solos that made me want to play guitar. Jason & The Scorchers are one of those bands that never really "made it" as far as mainstream music goes and this record was released, I'm sure, to please the long time devoted fans who bought the vynil or cassette versions before cds were common. So for the record company to edit out that solo is a big disservice and a major letdown to any Scorchers fan. I think Capitol should pull the cd's and re-re-release it with the solo back in the song where it should be or refund peoples' money. What a dissappointment.
1	I love this song, however, the quality of the recording leaves a lot to be desired. Plays OK but the compression really cuases a lot of distortion the as you increase the volume even on earbuds.  No difference when taken off computer and put on ipod.
1	"25 or 6 to 4," one of the greatest songs ever - right? This is not "25 or 6 to 4;" it's more like "Love me Tomorrow" or "Your the Inspiration."  This is the Chicago that at one point said "You know how our band has an incredible brass section? What if we just used synthesizers instead?" It is that Chicago that made this album; and It is the epitome of Adult Contemporary garbage.  I own thousands of Christmas songs; I make a habit of collecting all sorts because I love listening to Christmas music.  I can not make it through this album to no matter how many times I've tried.  I've actually deleted it off of every playlist I have and have even deleted the album entirely from my hard drive and cloud storage.  Yes.  It's that bad.  Now if you like Adult Contemporary music; and if you could care less about classic-sounding Christmas standards; and if you think that 80s Chicago is better than 70s Chicago, you may love this album.  Though it is brass-heavy (a good thing), it is also cheese-heavy; and I am saddened and a little offended that I came to own this album.
1	First off I haven't purchased this. i do have their first album and I thought it was great. This one is not for me. I've been a long time fan of Los Lobos and these guys try too hard to imitate. Sorry, but not even close. Los Lobos was a class act and produced some of the finest Tex Mex Music of 70's & 80's. These guys couldn't even try to cover one of Lobos songs. Sorry. But for even $5.99 I won't purchase.
1	shaq cant act, play ball, and definatly cant rap. how did this guy get a record deal! and shaq, the only reason your in the NBA is cause your a 300lbs. giant. its not cause you got game.
1	I simply did not realize that I would not like this format of music.  The disc is fine, the composition is not to my liking
1	Listening now, just don't think I will again. Not really calling my name. Sorry! Tried again, didn't do it for me.  Lowered to 1 star.
1	First, this is a shaped CD - this one is cut into the shape of a flag, with an overprint of the US flag. There is a warning on the CD to not play it in a car CD player. Well, that also goes for the CD/DVD drive in your computer.  However, beyond that, this has exactly one selection on it - the "1812 Overture", by P. Tchaikovsky.  Finally, it seems like this CD was printed at home; the case is thinner, and the liner - such as it is - is just sort of inserted into the case. The disc attaches to the case on the front side (not the back), and the disc was detached when I received it. However, due to most of the disc not being accessible (due to the only part that can be read is where there is a complete circle, and that is minimal - just enough for the 15:35 of the single selection), that did not preclude my playing of it; however, as stated above, it not being round did.  None of this is stated in the listing; had I known, I would not have bought it. That's why it is going back.  At least there are 50 stars on the flag (I counted, as I was doubting that there were, considering the balance).
1	alot of hype and  not much depth.  she got  a  chance to  have  a good greatest  hits package.problem  for her  is that  alot of material  seems to contrived and  leaves very little to the imagination. not all her fault.  she is  a marginal vocalist and she rides on cliche  grooves and familar sound cuts. this time  this album is flat.  she got her own lane until she runs out of a hit.
1	Any recording of PROMISES, PROMISES should come with a warning not to listen to this score unless you want these lethally contagious tunes and beats buzzing around in your head for weeks afterward.  That said, I personally much prefer the original cast recording, originally on United Artists Records, and one of the few released on that label.  Like many revivals the performances here are mostly fine technically but somehow lacking a certain feel and je ne sais quoi. Sean Hayes has a pleasant voice but with an annoying vibrato (wobble) on sustained notes. Kristen Chenoweth is pretty much note-perfect - after all she does easily toss off the fiendishly difficult "Glitter and be Gay" from CANDIDE - but the bouncy (and deceptively simple) Bacharach/David mode seems a little stiff in her deliveries.  I admit to favoring the mellow, expressive baritone of Jerry Orbach, one of my favorite Broadway male singers, and especially the unique, slightly countrified soprano of darling Jill O'Hara on the original original cast. There is also a loose, effortlessly swinging,(and authentically Bacharach) feel to the original orchestra sound which seems lost on the by-the-numbers instrumentalists of today. (But this is a very fine point).  The unnecessary additions to the score have already been mentioned here.  I was pondering how to discreetly describe the source of "A House Is Not A Home" but it's already here, it was from a film about a whorehouse. But when you think of it, isn't that something akin to what the lead guy here is doing with his apartment?
1	So lets see....the vocals suck badly and are sung in the most annoying way possible with the singer only making his voice sound worse with each poorly written verse.  The guitars are decent in places but quickly fizzle out, the drums are run of the mill and the lyrics are laughable....again with some of the worst sounding, most poorly sung vocals ever recorded.  The song seems to go on forever too with same garbage repeating in a 7 min loop with stupid frilly breaks......This truly sucks.
1	The process for downloading this MP3 file using Vista is pathetic.  I don't know who to blame... Amazon, Microsoft or myself. There is no determining where this download ended up because the first download required a reboot.  look out!
1	Vulgar language in song writing is just laziness and lack of talent.
1	not her best at all.
1	The singer's voice is like male Natalie Merchant.  He looks different on the album cover than on the TV.  I found these Christian alt songs refreshing b/c everything else is secular, even Catholics view it as such.   "Don't you know God made you something electric.." here he is reiterating an important Biblical principal,  that everyone is special  in God's eyes.
1	To put it simply, it's repetitive and boring.  We know you have money and you like weed Wiz.  How about something different?
1	The CD was in bad shape and I sent it back
1	This is horrible. This music has so many white trash cliches. Whiskey, Jesus, cheap wine, guns... this crap will be heard throughout trailer parks all over America. Right now a baby boy named Bubba is being conceived in a rusty 4X4 to this music. Picture it if you will, the smell of cigarettes and weed, cow s*** and exhaust permeate the air while the pickup rocks back and forth, the rusty springs of the truck and the guttural moans of billy bob and his cousin Tonya more pleasant than the raspy voice of kid rock blaring through a pair of 6X9's propped up on either side of the dashboard.
1	This song really has no appeal, it was a filler track from her re-issue of Teenage Dream and i must say it was not a well produced song. It doesent stand out above her previous confection of hits, sorry Katy.
1	This is a great song but not the original version I'd hope for. So I'm a little disappointed to say the least will keep looking,.
1	Last year's American Idol winner, Jordin Sparks, really hasn't hit the nail on the head with great songs on her debut. While her debut single Tattoo was a fair song, it just hasn't shown that she has stood out well to compete with greats like Alicia Keys or newcomer Chrisette Michele. Her second single from that album, No Air with rising Hip Hop star Chris Brown, doesn't work well either. While the song has a fairly nice beat, it just doesn't seem to be an everlasting song that stands out. On top of that, the duet doesn't actually show that there is complete chemistry like other classics. I just honestly think she has a good talent, but needs to find better footing for the long run. Her next single needs to do a much better job at sealing the deal.  Song: D+
1	I liked it when I heard the small preview but when you listen to the whole version, when he gets to "just as I am" he pronounces it "just as I yam". That part isn't in the preview or I wouldn't have bought it. I'm sorry but when you make a recording, diction is everything and the recording engineers should have picked up on that and had him do it over until he pronounced it correctly. I'm not just nitpicking but it's hard to listen to this version respectfully when he's turned it into a paean to yams I wince when I hear him singing with such poor diction and ended up deleting it completely. There are much better versions of this lovely old hymn out there!
1	This is obvious, badly-produced music with lyrics that could have been written by a sixteen-year-old. It took her five years to come up with a measly ten songs? Too bad she doesn't have a Lilith Fair to hype her own career anymore. Withoutother artists' coat-tails to ride on, hopefully people will see her for what she is: a background singer with delusions of artistic importance.
1	Only two stars because I woke up in a cold sweat thinking my expensive stereo system just went up in flames. If you like the sounds of a house fire combined with classical music, you'll love this album!
1	Back to the same old Tori - "...Attracted to Sin" is MUCH better IMO - creative and daring - love it!
1	It's too long and he talks a lot instead of letting the music doing its job. The other version is better where he sings in the beginning. This version is way too long.
1	I am very disappointed in this album.  The entire 2nd side of the album is unplayable because it skips so bad.
1	I was really looking forward to some new music from Katy to jam out to but this song just isn't doing it for me. Its got a great message and all, but overall I just don't like the sound of it.
1	I only purchased this more for posterity than anything. It's a dreadful recording and the vocals on 2nd Chapter are down right ear piercing, not in a good way. I remember being so much better, then again we all thought early Christian rock/folk music was delightful.
1	I didn't like the song after buying it. The sample was misleading.
1	This is supposed to be a sample of Anita O'Day singing. All you can hear is the piano player. He's great, but this misses the point-- one wants to hear how she sounds.
1	Arshin Mal Alan (Azerbaijani: Arn mal alan) is a 1913 comic and romantic operetta by Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov about the cloth peddler in the 1900s Shusha, who is looking for a wife. Hajibeyov composed the operetta in Saint Petersburg and it was staged on October 25, 1913. The operetta is rich in national characteristics and realism. The plot is centered on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab. Asker's friend Suleyman suggests him disguising as a fabric peddler, a sure way to meet women. Asker agrees and starts to go round the houses selling fabrics. Asker finally meets a woman called Gulchohra and both fall in love with each other, even though Asker's actual identity remains unknown to Gulchohra. Asker ultimately asks Gulchohra's father, the wealthy Sultan bey, for marriage permission, revealing his real activities. Sultan bey agrees, but Gulchohra objects as she can only love the peddler. She eventually learns that the rich businessman is really her beloved peddler.  The story ends with four couples getting married at the same time.
1	I did not purchase this item.
1	Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.
1	I purchased this CD upon the recommendation of a male friend, a musician, and was very disappointed upon listening to it.  There's nothing new here, nor done very well.  I'm afraid that my friend was taken in by a beautiful face, because her jazz talent is certainly lacking.  I'd send it back for a refund if I could.
1	This song kind of sucks. First off, I don't know why I have it.  Secondly, the singer is okay. Nothing too dynamic about the singing. Lyrics are nothing deep or interesting. In fact, there are only about four lines in the song and I'm still not quite sure what he's talking about. Lastly, what could have been at least just a bad song is utterly destroyed by the awful, awful background music. It literally sounds like screeching. Thanks Amazon for the unwanted freebie. Not.
1	I bought this title in the 1990's. I asked the owner of the store about it; he said it was 'melodic'. I believe he mistakenly thought it was the "Live" album, because the two titles have such similar cover designs.  "Audentity" is a huge mess of uninteresting, worthless, flat-out garbage. I have (most happily!) not heard it in years, but I remember a lot of crap such as the sounds of doors closing, things falling on a floor, and various other sound effects that serve no purpose without images to accompany them. Don't waste your time or money on it --- unless you'd like to buy the one I have.
1	I friend of mine shot me the Youtube link to this video the other day.  As you can tell from my review title, I typically shy away from pop music.  I tend to regard pop music with an odd sort of suspicion.  I've never really understood why, but I've always regarded the lyrics as insipid.  However, listened to Rebecaa Black's "Friday," and . . .  . . . what's going on here?  Excuse me a minute.  There's a stain on my wall--it seems to be spreading.  It looks like my walls are . . . bleeding.  Oh God.  It is blood.  I can smell the iron-tinge of it, causing me to retch.  I grab a sponge and begin to scrub.  But the blood . . . the blood just spreads all over the white stucco surface.  My Lord . . . what's happening to me?  I turn and look at the picture of my family.  Their eyes are all missing.  The smiles, once rich with happiness, have dissipated.  Only savage coutenances of pain remain etched across their otherwise unmoving features.  Am I insane?  What's happening to me?  Or is this reality?  A cacophony begins to sound within my head.  "Friday, Friday, FUN FUN FUN!  Friday, Friday, FUN FUN FUN!"  No.  This is not fun.  My very sanity, my very attachment to this plane of reality is in danger.  I fear for my immortal soul.  I must scourge this demon from my mind.  What's that on the counter?  It's a screwdriver.  Yes!  A screwdriver!  This will do it!  Out, damn demons, out!  Oh, it hurts.  It hurts!  The screwdriver, driven down my ear canal, triggers another torrent of blood that mixes with the spread carnage already on the floor.  But still the neraphym's song continues.  What have I done?  What will become of us?  If you find this message, spread the word.  I have the seen the end.  It is the end of everything.  It comes after Thursday but before Saturday, and it is not fun.
1	Not as enjoyable as first.  Too many mash-ups.
1	Downloaded only seven of the songs due to download #8 freezing my computer. The first review was right! Buyer beware. I am re-editing now this review after contacting customer service. They allowed me to redownload the album free of charge! Kudos to Amazon! The rating should be now changed to four stars, but I'm unable to change it, as the editing software only allows me to add these words I'm typing but not change my previous star rating.
1	The very very worst, the WORST, DID I ALREADY SAY THE WORST? Dylan recordings EVER
1	As a loyal fan of Type O going back to Bloody Kisses, it pains me to say that in my opinion the band has lost their way with Dead Again. It feels derivative, lazy and uninteresting. I gave it three listens, trying to find something in it appealing, and aside from September Sun, came up short.  Took it out of the changer, put in their previous work, and I was much happier.
1	If you've ever wondered what your favorite holiday songs would sound like being sung by an ashtray, this is the CD for you.  Don't get me wrong. I love Bob Dylan. Especially some of his most recent CDs. His grizzled, weary, cigarette-laden voice suits later material like "Modern Times" and "Love & Theft" very well. "Christmas In The Heart," however, sounds like a 68-year-old emphysemic wheezing his way through a winter wonderland, leaving a trail of phlegm in the snow behind him. It's enough to make the most devout Christian consider atheism.  Giving this two-stars. One for each of Bob's tar-filled lungs.  Love ya, Bob. Just not this CD.
1	This song is awful. Way to slow and its the same words over and over again. One star is my rating.
1	I just don't understand why Josh Groban has to depart to what really defined his music.  He does have a few songs that resonate the previous 'GOOD' stuff that is Grobanmusic of grandeur standard... but this album is really disappointing overall. Probably you will be better of just downloading some selections to get the Groban fix you need...  It just sounds like his voice was being pushed too much and sorry Josh but some songs sounds too nasal to me.
1	I like only 2-3 songs on this album.  The songs were hard to understand as far as what she was saying was not not comprehensible.  No thanks and she shold have done a duet or two to make the album more diverse. Highly disappointed.
1	I couldn't download the song. It was a waste of money. I should have just bought the cd at FYE, at the mall. I'm not very pleased.
1	Poor sound quality! Good song
1	Have you ever thought what would happen if you told your parrot to write a song, that sounded like a love song, but actually had a dark meaning, then told the parrot to sing the song, put it on an album? Neither have I, but that logic is what drives this song. Really folks, this song has all the quality of you're parrot doing. Especially the singing, oh gosh the singing...  Overall, a pathetic effort, from a guy that doesn't deserve to see the light of the music world day.
1	I only enjoy track two and theree on the entire album. I've been a fan even before she went mainstream. Mary has a raw talent that burst with joy andpain. I feel that she is at a good place in her life. Her music represents her joy, but the ballads are simple, nothing close to her last album where her new found love of god and her husband bhrought out some her best songs in the twenty first century. I still love mary, but this album will not be rotating in my car or at home.
1	I never liked this song. I never understood how the boy was just like the dad. He related to his dad with the same lack of attention his dad had shown him. But he sounded attentive and concerned about his own kids (they had the flu), so to me the boy turned out better that the dad, not just like him. This song is just one big blah.
1	he looks like wife beater. he's awesome
1	I Love Love Love Cyril Ritchard's reading of Alice.  But "Chapter 10" is not "Chapter 10" - Chapter 5 was downloaded!  And I cannot find out how to contact anyone to make this right! Feh.
1	I can't figure out how to download it to my phone
1	I have been a fan of Sanctus Real for several years.  I have all their CDs prior to this release, so I preordered this one.  Bands fall into 3 categories, those that attempt and succeed at improving their trademark sound, those that continue playing with their trademark sound, and those that change their sound over the span of multiple CDs.  While Sanctus Real continues to write great lyrics, they have taken the route of changing their sound up over the past few CDs.  As their instruments were my main draw to their music, I am a bit disappointed with this cd.  While Run is an awesome song, they have too greatly departed from the sound of Fight the Tide, Face of Love, and Say it Loud for me to like this release.  My honest opinion is to buy the mp3 of the song Run at least and hope they take a different approach with their instruments, if you do not like the entire cd after sampling on spotify.  Regardless of the decision you make, I do recommend snagging Kings and Queens by Audio Adrenaline and also Vital by Anberlin, as the instruments and vocals are outstanding.  They are must have releases.  Release the Panic by Red is also worth checking out, though while it is a great cd, it does not surpass Faces, in my opinion.  Happy listening.
1	In a few parts of the song seem like they are missing words yet it continues.
1	Man, this is bunk. I've heard hundreds of thousands of electronica but this music here reminds me of some immature pop crap. It's uninspiring and some of the songs lack a good rhythm
1	This is NOT the original group, but a re-record by some group of studio musicians.  Nowhere near as good or talented as the Original Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds.  If you are a fan of the original you will be very disappointed.
1	WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, I was Looking for Various artiest Christmas Songs, but something we have all heard, up beat. Nah - seem more chorus than anything else.
1	Not the true singer.
1	What do you get when you combine zero artistry, cheesy synthesizers, a guy singing like he's recording a 1980s beer commercial, sugary/creepy childrens back-up vocals, Dickensian stereotypes about modern low-income children being "dirty from head to toe", overly obvious, beat you over the head with my message lyrics, soap opera-level emotional manipulation, Jesus (hasn't he suffered enough?), and a frog-log-dog rhyming scheme?  I'll tell you.  You get the worst, so-bad-it's-hilarious, downright embarrassing Christmas song ever recorded to tape... The Christmas Shoes.
1	I wasn't expecting another version of Hot Fuss but certainly not what I heard when I put the Cd in.  I thought okay, give it a few more listens but I found myself asking does this end?  It sounds like Brandon Flowers was trying for new sound but it's sounds more like a whine to me than anything else.  The change ups are terrible and the songs down right depressing.  If you're a fan of Hot Fuss and want something anything even remotely close to that, this isn't the Cd for you.  The song, "When you were young" is so so at best and even with that, I think I'm being too kind.  I was so looking forward to this new Cd but it's going back in the cd case and joining the rest of the Bands that I had so much hope to continue to get better with their next cd but failed.
1	I will no longer purchase downloadable music from Amazon or its associated vendors. Even on a brand spanking new computer they won't download, or on the opposite end, download 3 or 5 times. If I can't count on getting what I want, what's the use in trying to purchase it here?
1	This album was the genre I was looking for but the music fell far below my expectations. It was just another group trying to make apolitical statement with out any responsibility.
1	This album had the most hype of 2008 but has no real substance. All of the 100 mix tapes sound better than this album. Lil Wayne raps like he is in a syrup coma (his lyrics are lazy and non creative) "like the number after one imma get me two" -Lil Wayne, this type of lyricism is unacceptable. With all the talented producers on this album this should be this best album of the year. This album should have been a maxi single with just a milli, misunderstood, nothing on me, and Dr Carter, on all the other songs Wayne raps lazy and sounds drunk. It's like that album "Encore" from Eminem when you think you're the best rapper and get too arrogant it shows. Wayne has to prove his skills every time best rapper or not, Jay Z has never rapped that lazy in his life, so it a nut shell this is a big disappointment this album although successful is only based on lil Wayne's popularity and mix tape flow but he only has a few commercial hits the rest of the album the lyrics just are not up to par.
1	Streaming Amazon Prime movies doesn't work well
1	Not the whole play. Terrible audio quality.
1	Was supposed to be a two CD set and only received ONE CD!!Very dissatisfied and embarrassing since it was a gift.
1	Too bad nobody can sing here.
1	Okay before I start bashing FeFe I want to say one thing in response to the review written by Tanika. Tanika dear, it doesn't matter what color skin you have you can do whatever kind of music you like. And this isn't 'grunge' my dear. Do you even know what grunge is? It's a combination of punk and metal. Something that died in the mid '90s. Oh yeah, and this isn't punk like everything thinks it is. It's POP!! So if you like poppy poser-punk bands like Lillix, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan then this is for you. Me on the other hand, I'll stick listening to my Hole CDs. I wish Courtney Love and her crew would come back and wipe out all of these fluff 'rockers' like Avril Lavigne and Michelle Branch. The music industry would be a much better place.
1	Was completely puzzled when this showed up. Wouldn't have chosen it, free or not. Lot of unmusical things going on and the mp3 is bad in several places. Sorry, it's going to get deleted.
1	I can't buy what I can't see. Fix it. I will try one more time sometime, someday. If I have time. and remember.
1	Despite a 4-year hiatus, My Chemical Romance didn't have their feet set when they wrote this album. Conflicting statements by singer Way ("The band misses being a rock band"-2008 "We realized it was okay to make a dance album." -2010) indicate this struggle. Not surprisingly, the results are a peg below mixed, with four (4!), ineffective ballads, a dizzingly inept crack at Franz Ferdinand-inspired swing, and toothless rockers dotting the homely landscape. Only "Na Na Na," "Bulletproof Heart," and "Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back," pump life into this dud. If this is what 2019 sounds like, I'm in no rush to get there.
1	Sucks.
1	I liked everything over all but dude I didn't get my poster nor the "extra" photo card I was so mad, and I honestly don't wanna go through all the trouble of returning it back and blah blah blah. I'm so disappointed.
1	Just filed a complaint after being forced to listen to this song when placed on hold twice! I couldn't believe my ears-----Their lyrics are about "Getting High" when "Your Dreams Go By" LITERALLY!! "Let your heavy eyes fall down, We see our lives as the dreams go by" Seriously Amazon?? What are you thinking???? Or Are You High?????
1	This file is damaged, it has skips and pops all through it, artifacts I don't expect with digital.  It's too bad, I love this song. Save your money, it's not listenable.
1	Not what I wanted. Waste of time and money.
1	Beautiful and with his son reading at the end . . . .a total blessing
1	The first album is honestly in my top 10 of all time. That being said I didn't expect this album to be exactly the same or to replace it.  But I hoped I would like a song or two.  The lyrics and sound seem to have losted all that I loved about the first album. Themes are generic and the vocals seemed to get lost on songs that seem over engineered.  I have listened to the album 5 times through and I am almost ready to say I "like" track 1,the Collapse, but that's even a stretch.  I'll give it another 5 spins because of my love to the debut album but this CD seems destined for the basement bin.
1	The mix on this song is awful,the background noise takes over which tells me they are trying to hide a lot of flaws in Nia's voice. She is from the t.v. show" Dance Moms" and should have let Abby Lee Miller produce her song. Abby as she does in everything that she works on puts out excellence songs for the girls she produces. Nia and her mom Holly made a big mistake not using Abby: As this song is awful, even the title is bad what does a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life ?? The cover is tacky,it looks like they used Microsoft Word to spell Nia's name in shadows !!! Bad all the way around. Save your money and order Kendall Vertes song "Wear em out" now that's a great song and you can buy it on Amazon for .99 cents. Your picture on the cover should have been centered. Sorry, Nia I'm afraid a music career is not for you.
1	"I hate nostalgia, you know, I really do. (...) You obviously remember things from your own past, which is reasonable enough because all those things are things that you've learned from. But that's different than applying it in a cultural way where people refuse to think about new solutions by copying old ones (...). People who actually avoid decisions by going backwards - that's different. Which is what I think of nostalgia as: a means to avoid making decisions about how to keep moving".  That's an excerpt from a Genesis P-Orridge (the guy from Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV) interview. Whether you've heard of him before or not doesn't really matter; his point does, though. This is an artistically sick decade, which mainstream groups and musicians can't do anything except for rehashing what their musical "forefathers" did. From Franz Ferdinand to Electroclash to Amy Winehouse - that seems the trend in modern pop. That seems to be it's disease.  I when first heard this record, I was impressed in how dated it sounded. Nothing against "old" music at all, but why listen to Winehouse if you can buy Billie Holiday? Always stick to the originals, people.
1	This is a dangerous mind control cult, and this book, and it's follower's have destroyed the lives of many, many people.  This group is famous for endless realestate scams, money scams, and actual deaths of infant children in Arboles, Colorado, and Placentia, California.  This book breeds complete INTOLLERANCE, for everyone who is not a follower of this MIND CONTROL CULT.  It teaches hatred for the Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindu, Buddhists, doctors, lawyers, organized democracy, free speech, and freedom of religion.  Many UFO/Doomsday cults have been based on this SICK BOOK, and many people have been harmed physically and psychologically by association with these Oahspe Bible Religious Cults.  These cults have destroyed many marriages, destroyed family relationships, ruined many careers, and caused people to just walk away from their family and children, to go live in a cult commune waiting for the end of the world.  Now, with the internet, these FANATICS, are RANTING AND RAVING about this and that quotation from Oahspe that they repeat like a PARROT.  It is like listening to a ROBOT read Chinese.  They all seems like brainwahed ZOMBIES, who have no idea what they are saying.  One simple truth is certain.  These OAHSPE BIBLE MIND CONTROL CULTS are recruiting new members as you read this, in their YOUTUBE media blitz.  They are almost as PROLIFIC as ISIS, the extremist MILITANT ISLAMIC CULT.  And speaking of ISIS, were you aware that previous Oahspe BIble Cults have required new married male converts to turn their wives to the CULT? The Los Angeles Herald, July 14, 1895 issue, investigated a CRAZY OAHSPE BIBLE CULT in Placentia, Calilfornia.  It was well documented that an Oahspe Bible Cult there, was involved in recruiting wealthy land owners in the Placentia, Californa area, and one of the CULT LEADERS confessed to the Herald reporter, that Yes,  The cult did require new married men who were joining the CULT, to turn over their wives to the cult for SEXUAL BREEDING PURPOSES.  It that is not bizarre enough, two cult members were indicted on murder charges in the death of a one year old infant, who was literally starved to death.  According to published reports, the infant was raised from birth on PEELED apples. At one years old, it was nothing but SKIN and bones. The child was placed in FOSTER care, but was so sickly it died shortly after.  George R. Hinde, and Dr. Louis Schlesinger were indicted on murder charges, but the trial in Orange County, California was later dropped because of the horrible publicity the murder trial was bringing the region.  George R. Hinde, was also involved in starving his own 18 year old daughter to death, who was not keen on Oahspe, or a vegetarina diet. The father, locked his daughter in her room and gave her bread and water for two years. Alice Hinde, died after a two year diet of bread and water, and was burried in the garden, out the back door, without even a gravestone.  Another Oahspe Bible Cult, in Arboles, Colorado was also documented in many, many newspapers across the United States.  They were involved in the starvation death of 12 infant children in one year.  This occured in October, 1906, four miles outside the tiny Colorado town of Arboles, Colorado. Of 13 orphan children awarded to the cult, 12 of those childrent were starved to death.  6 of those death occured in one month.  Two Oahspe Bible Cult leaders were indicted and sent to jail to await trial in the deaths of these children.  George C. Rose and Minnie Wheeler were indicted and stood trial for the deaths of the 12 children.  There have been many many more Oahspe Bible cults, beside the two listed on review.  I personally lived in an Oahspe Bible UFO DOOMSDAY Cult for 2 years which was almost identical to HEAVENS GATE. This Cult was Universal Light, and was located only 7.5 miles from the Placentia, California cult that starved two children to death.  Universal Light was a pyramid scheme of endless recruiting scams, designed to recruit people who had read the Oahspe Bible.  The Cult Leader, Mary Lou Brown, AKA, GODDESS OF THE RED STAR, used an unending array un MIND CONTROL, and THOUGHT REFORM techniques to recruit and then retain followers.  These techniques included: Sleep deprivation, poor diet, cult indoctrination, meditation, singing praises, blah, blah, blah. The long and short of it, this group was waiting for the END OF THE WORLD, a NUCLEAR HOLOCOUST, and JUDGEMENT DAY.  Afterwards, all the CHOSEN ONES, would be gathered up in a giant UFO SHIP, which would whisk everyone off to the moon for two years.  And while they were away, a VENGEFULL Jehovah god, would burn the memory of every person left on the planet with a giant RAY OF WHITE LIGHT, which basically turn everyone into a ZOMBIE.  THIS IS THE SICK WORLD OF OAHSPE BIBLE.  Signed, Oahspe Bible UFO/Doomsday CULT Survivor Woodson Payne.
1	I love this album but it was touted as being brand new and came open with a sticker on the vinyl sleeve that said "new."  My artwork is ruined and I'm a vinyl collector. Wow.
1	I am writing this review to warn off others who, like me, may have been looking for a compilation of Jazz Sax Greats.  This is not it!  What we have here is a disastrous collection of Muzak inspired pseudo sax music that makes Kenny G look like a hard bopper!  This set of discs is no less than a feeble attempt to kill off the saxophone as an instrument of your enjoyment.  But as we all know, the saxophone is strong!  And the saxophone will live on!  Because I paid American money for it, I made myself sit through all four discs.  I can truly say that I suffered.  I love all kinds of music and can find the good in almost anything, but these four discs rank up there with the worst musical experiences I have ever had.  Somebody should be held responsible for disseminating something like this in such nice packaging and with NO Warning whatsoever of the pain ready to be unleashed from within.  Believe me, I am holding back here!  Other people must have bought this and been too nauseated to warn the rest of us.  I'm holding it together long enough to do my duty to The Community and steer you in another direction, ANY other direction!  Godspeed, there you have it, proceed at your own risk...
1	It was not the CD I expected. I love Gaither Vocal Band but not this CD.
1	Okay, I know this is Yes 2011, but I've had this thing stuck in the CD slot of my Xterra for days and days, and I still can't say that it is a full-blown hit, or if I really can say that I like it, I want to really, but I can't help remembering all the previous awesome Yes material. and I've been a fan since 1972. Seems as if there's too many riffs I've heard before- or some new takes on how to screw with the controls, this disc does have a few good moments, it's just too few, though, and the new singer is adequate, but I really miss Andersen's phrasing. Seems to me the guy's are kinda running out of ideas these days, or maybe they are just getting old like all of us, but to me, I can see the writing on the wall, now that Andersen's gone, they're trying to reinvent themselves. I'll leave it in the CD player for now, I really want to like it, but I can't help thinking I could pop this thing in the local rest home CD player and the crowd might really groove on it. Oh well, I've at least got the new Andersen, Wakeman CD to look forward to-
1	I thought because of the expensive price of $58.00 the music would be very "hypnotic", as it says on the DVD. It is not. If opened DVD's were returnable, I would return it.
1	Did not recieve or order this.
1	One of my very favourite moments in the history of providing the Official Room 101 of Amazon was my review of Susan Boyle's debut album, that two ton turd of a record that had idiots falling over themselves trying to praise it, with laughable and often baffling use of hyperbole to describe Susan's voice, as if hearing it could cure the sick, make Israel and Palestine have a group-hug and drag Princess Diana back from Hell.  And so slating it (as, indeed, it richly deserved) was ever so much fun, simply for the upset and anger it caused to the musically ignorant and reality show brainwashed. So, with that in mind, there was no way I was going to miss the opportunity of reviewing her new album. Especially when, and get this, it's easily worse than the first.  Described as a "Gift to her fans" (I don't remember ever having to PAY for a gift before..?), the makers of this album seem to think that slowing every song down so damn much that it barely has a pulse, then adding a backing orchestra = haunting beauty. When in fact, all it does is make quite possibly the most boring album of the year. Boyle's voice is admittedly nice enough, but there's no way she can hold your attention for more than a minute, especially on these flat and, frankly, tedious songs.  And whilst before it was the Stone's "Wild Horses" being given the Boyle treatment, this time its Lou Reed's dedication to being ripped to the gills on heroin, Perfect Day. Somehow the stripped back charm and honesty of the original is lost in Boyle's brainless, overblown honk. There's no depth in the vocal, no sense of humility in the "I wish I was someone else, someone good" line - nothing. She could be reading the back of a Cornflakes box for the range of emotion she gives out here.  Oh, and look - there's also 2008's X Factor song, Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah", for the 12 people in the world who aren't sick to death of it by now. It's funny the phrase "you don't really care for music, do ya?" is still included, as it pretty much sums up the mentality of anyone who actually buys these horrible records in the first place.  Anyway, throw in another cover of Crowded House's "Don't Dream It's Over (when listening to it, that's all I did) and six Christmas carols that will, honestly, have you weeping into your hands and eying up that bottle of bleach under the sink. Your life has not hit rock bottom until you sit through "Away in a Manger" (seriously, that is actually on this album) by Susan Boyle.  The real facepalm moment comes in at the third track, as its a duet with newcomer Amber Stassi. You won't know who she is, so let me explain. Susan put out a "search for a star" style competition to find the New Susan Boyle. Quite how you entered that, I'm not sure. How DO you become the New Susan Boyle? Surely sending the application form back covered in your own drool and excrement would've been a good start. So it's as syrupy, over produced and dead inside as every other song on this wretched album. "Do You Hear What I Hear?" Sure do, Susan - that's me vomiting into the sink.  Here's the thing; Susan Boyle seems like a fairly fun, jolly woman, that is when she's removed from the flashing lights and media hooplah that make you think she's going to cause a riot like a hairier King Kong. So the idea of removing all sense of fun and frivolity from her and instead replacing it with Super Serious Susan is actually a dis-service to the woman herself. She says that she wanted to create an album dedicated to the music of her youth. That's fine. But if anyone's youth was as barren and boring as the music here, they'd have emptied a shotgun barrel into their mouths by now. I'm not saying Boyle should be body-popping or beat boxing, but Hells bells, give her a song with at least a BIT of kick to it. Is that really so much to ask?  To newcomers who want to see what all the fuss is about - do NOT be fooled by the hype, the sales or the salivating, urine-stained drones on this website. Susan has a nice, if not great, voice, and it's lost and wasted on yet another album of dreary, imagination-free cover versions. Whoever you are, you deserve better than that.
1	Had to repeat download several times. Then after download was complete not all the songs listed were included. When I tried to download the individual missed songs, the whole album would download again, ... and again, ...  I like having the access to many wonderful songs, but the process was not pleasant, and the desired music wasn't fully received.
1	This album was originally released in the late '80s.  I'm a fan of the Strange Cargo albums, so I was excited to find this in a bargin bin circa 1992.  Unfortunately, only one track ("Swamp Dog") is instrumental.  I don't have anything against lyrics or singing but I didn't find anything here worth keeping.  The bit of singing on his "Hello, Waveforms" album is much better.  I passed this CD along to a Pawn Shop or CD store pretty quickly.  Listening to the clips now, I can tell that some of the tracks have also shown up on Strange Cargo albums as instrumentals.
1	Didnt like the cd other then that it was good
1	I listened to a song out of curiosity, I didn't want to like it, and I was happy to hear, that it's pretty bad. Leslie Rasmussen of "Good English" thinks a woman is at least somewhat responsible for her rape if she drank too much. She also thinks binge drinking causes good people to rape. I hope she will educate herself, and might I suggest a back up career? It won't be music, not just because of your choices to minimize rape of an unconscious woman, but because your music is like a violent assault on the ears.
1	Great songs by various artists. Nice music but not my type
1	This isn't even nearly as close to the kind of work that "In with the Old" or "Kona Town" had to offer. Every track seems to have the same guitar riffs as the next. The only thing keeping this album afloat is the drummer. I was expecting Pepper to veer off course from their last self titled album. But instead they decided to roll with the same ol same. I'm really disappointed. From the lyrics to the melody. If you're looking for old school pepper that was all about the green bottles and sitting on the curb then you will be surprised to find this is no where near that.
1	This is yet another exploitation set, comprising theme songs that we enjoyed as much for their performance quirks and eccentricities as for their melodies, then re-recorded by synthesizers and studio musicians WITHOUT any of the aforementioned charm. You will be sorry if you buy any of these tracks. I know I am.
1	Libertad Lamarque played in HELLO, DOLLY! in Argentina and in Mexico. There's a hard to find EP of a few songs. This is the title song. And it is good. HOWEVER I tried to download it twice, got instructions from Amazon, and still have not been able to download it. It was a freebie, so there's nothing for Amazon to refund.  So, the song is terrific, as are the performer and the performance.  But Amazon's role in making it available is for crap! Forget about trying to download it. Pay the big costs for the EP on Ebay if you really want it!!
1	This is the worst song I have ever heard in my life. I could effin write this myself and make money doing it. How about "Gotta take a pee, gotta take a pee, gotta take a pee, gotta take a pee...."
1	Couldn't stomach much of this. Slow, lifeless, abomination of the REAL symphony. Depressing.
1	I have heard this song a lot lately, in various stores and pumping through the loudspeakers at the gym before I turn on my ipod. It sounds like something that was designed by a committee to hit that perfect combination of catchy, trendy and completely inoffensive. Somehow it's also gratingly annoying and sticks in your (your here being "my") head for days after it's been heard. It's worse than "It's A Small World After All." Perhaps it's the familiarity of the "Time Of My Life" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise. I might just walk out of the next store where I hear this playing if I am near the exit and don't have a full cart of groceries which I will have to abandon. To the powers that be who decided to assault my ears with the repeated plays of this little gem, please, for the love of all that is good in the world, pick something else.
1	The information was getting good and then just cuts off.  I would not recommend spending your 99 cents on this file as it is incomplete.
1	(...)I will start by saying that I admired Nirvana and I LOVED the new life that they injected into rock music in the early 90's. The problem is, this record just isn't what everyone makes it out to be. Kurt Cobain was a lyrical genius, but some of the music on this record is absolutely impossible for anyone with a sense of pitch or timing to listen to. I know, I know, it's essentially a punk record, but a major-label debut album should have better songs on it, especially one that was hyped as much as this. Kurt Cobain was a media darling from the beginning, initially because of his outspoken attitudes towards the macho-types and support of women and homosexuals, and later because of his train-wreck of a "family life" with Courtney Love, daughter Frances Bean and his first love (heroin). When he took his own life in 1994, he became something of a tragic hero, and as a result, much more importance has been attached to Nirvana's music than it deserves. Period. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Come As You Are" are the only songs worth having on this CD. If you want to hear some GOOD early-90's "grunge" (God, I STILL hate that word!), pick up Pearl Jam's "Ten," Soundgarden's "Badmotorfinger," or the one-off collaboration between those two bands, "Temple Of The Dog."
1	I am perr-itty dissapointed in Decca for this nice little boxed set. Why?  Well, firstly the Symphonies are broken up. For example: #5 is with #2 and #7 with #1.  Then on one of the discs you get Leonore Overture 3, Symphony #4 and then the first movement of the 9th!...then you have put on the next disc for the rest of the 9th!  Oh Man!  Secondly, the sound quality is not the demonstration quality one expects from Decca during those amazing analogue years.  The sound sounds muddied up.  The volume levels are dim, and the clarity and brilliance don't shine through on the recordings.  Thirdly, Solti doesn't deliver as you know he should. They are standard readings with a bit of extra insight, but nothing of that typical "Solti" drive.  It seems that Beethoven isn't Solti's composer par excellence!  He doesn't understand him as say, Klemperer or Karajan do.  Solti and the CSO didn't really know each other so well back in 1972/74, and you can tell.  I'd imagine that their later digital cycle would be more authoratative than this first set.  I still like my Klemperer and my Karajan(any) sets!
1	Totally Original...except when it steals from interstellar and Mad Max Fury Road. Lolol you know those movies about space...and the desert.  These sounds jumped out at me as a clear influence. The guy should have kept those inspirations out for an amazing film otherwise.
1	I do not like this singer
1	Honestly why leave the BEST tracks out of the album? I thought we`d be getting  Money for Nothing, Drip Drop, or You're So Beautiful at least! I was disappointed because IMO its just not worth it.
1	For me.....just not as good of an album as awesome wave.  Gave it a few through listens and really only get into three of the tracks.  Bummed I should have just purchased the individual songs.  Probably the last album I will ever buy or pre-buy without sampling each track first.
1	I'd prefer being  water boarded  then to have to listen to this
1	It may grow on me
1	The ending few seconds of the song are cut off.  When it's such a moving and emotionally powerful song, to cut it short is very irritating.
1	music has no love in it. it really sucks and there is no reason for me to play it. t
1	youd never guess but i don't type. what do i have to do, put in my eniire genome? i quit
1	Pretty boring. Maybe the actually play might've been better; Stoppard doesn't usually disappoint. The music is pretty unremarkable.
1	Ahhh, LIL>NAY at it again.
1	Worm's Life is bad on so many levels it's hard to convey.  As good as GSHF was, this is the other end of the spectrum.  I would have liked to give it a half-star, or none, but that wasn't an option.  How something this bad got released is beyond comprehension......unless the band is under contract to "X" number of albums.  That could explain this.  The only thing more worthless than A Worm's Life would be any one of the millions of AOL CD's that show up in my mailbox.  At least I don't have to pay for them!  If you really want to buy this CD, go to half.com.  They have a bunch for about two bucks.
1	This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.  It would have been far better as a collection of music from early films or of more recent films.  As it is, it is a hodge podge that I really can't recommend to anyone.
1	Pushed the wrong button and somehow ordered this song by mistake so- don't mean to dis it- just trying to get it off my Amazon reviews.
1	I Love this song it got me motivated to fight the Good fight of Faith!
1	Nothing new, sounded like old stuff
1	To Bad I cant get my money back or at least credit
1	That was painful.
1	Hollywood Undead is about ten years too late with there gimmick. While I do enjoy there first album, it kicks off strong with Undead but after that it's basically the same song over and over again with different lyrics. Desperate Measures is a stop gap album (an album released between studio releases to keep fans happy) and it shows. Ive seen this band live and I don't remember it being bad but nothing i'd run and go tell everyone about. The cover songs are pretty bad as well. I wouldnt recommend this cd to anyone, although I do know there is some hardcore Hollywood Undead fans out there, and just wait for there new album which should be released.
1	I can't order it because Amazon doesn't take the time to tell a person what's on the darn CD. Italian Favorites!!?? That's a broad category! I'd like to know what's on it. I assume it's songs and music of some sort but it could just be a big package of lasagne - that's an Italian favorite. C'mon Amazon - don't keep it a big secret - what songs, in particular, are on this CD? C'mon - spill the fava beans.
1	Would like the original song but you have to buy the whole cd any way this one doesn't measure up would like a refund
1	Did not order, don't know why it is showing up on my account.
1	.....yeah right!....well,you want a review for this album........ok........this is the worst band in the world..is music for 5 years old brats who think they're cool listening to whining sorry lyrics and boring rappings......if you're into punk listen to real punk bands........what about some wizo.....they are young neither.......or bad religion...they're gods.........don't be a sucka my friend and if you bought this album gave it to your little cousins,......but I don't think they're dumb enough to take it.........
1	I was really looking forward to this CD purchase as I had previously purchased 'The Ladder'. When this arrived in the mail it only had one song on it. NOT what I was expecting for an album that coste $8!!!!!!!! So be warned, only one song & you can just download the song from iTunes for 99c. The song is really good though, just dissapointing as the cost would imply it is a full CD or at least 5 or 6 songs.
1	Quality of vinyl is good, but sound quality is not. This is probably because they used the same mastering for the vinyl. I loved this album when I downloaded it and thought it would sound even better and more dynamic on vinyl, as most vinyl issues have avoided being casualties of the loudness wars. But this one is an exception unfortunately. In the very first track the bass drum clips noticeably and everything else is very distorted. On lower end systems I could easily see the high volume levels causing skipping. Its a shame because this has more to do with the producers of the album, not the band itself. I would highly recommend them remastering this album for vinyl, perhaps having it done at Sterling or another place where they actually know what they're doing and know how to master a good sounding record. Its very easy to make a bad sounding record if one doesnt know what they are doing, and whoever did this one clearly didnt.
1	Not the version I wanted.
1	I really prefer the original artists. Some were pretty bad. Sorry....
1	Lyrics aside, this is the worst thing I have ever heard.  Total crap! Autotune could not save this steaming pile of dung. Please never put out another musical journey into the bowels of atrocity again.  Puting a wobble effect on synths does not make it dubstep nor you a "dubstep producer".  Let this album die a quick death and refund the money to the 3 people that bought it.
1	As much as I enjoy Lenny Dee, I am not very encouraged to purchase this item.  How many songs, no song list.  Who would want to purchase an item with so little information?  Put more product information on the page, I may yet purchase the item.  I gave it only 1 star because how else could I truthfully rate it.
1	After hearing Intuition on radio I had no intentions of buying this album until I found it in the bargain bin selling for under $10 Australian dollars so I thought what the heck. It's as bad as I thought it was. I have listened to it several times to give it the benefit of doubt but sadly it just doesnt cut it at all. I may as well have purchased a mediocre pop Britney-try hard album. The lyrics are meaningless and the music does not even cut it as dance tracks. It is terrible but it is also sad that a woman with such talent has resorted to producing such a poor quality album in the quest for pop stardom....
1	Give me a Willie Nelson album withOUT all the production this one has.  Willie is the kind of artist that only needs his guitar, his voice and his talent (just like Steve Earle on the E-town Live CD). I suppose the people around him need the money though, so I'll give them twenty for helping Willie help others. Everyone mentions how good Teatro is and I'll admit it is great, its a better kind of production, but I when I listen to the material from the 70's (ie, Shotgun Willie, Phases and Stages, Red Headed Stranger)it brings to mind a less complicated time.  Something closer to the truth. In summary, I buy Willie albums because of Willie and I'll buy another album for one or two jewels on it.  ( I bought the vinyl Emmy Lou Harris's 'Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town' just to hear 'One Paper Kid' with Willie on it and I bought the Bugs Henderson CD 'Daredevils of the Red Guitar' for the song 'These Eyes' with Willie singing on that one.)  On the bright side, I did like the web interface which comes with the CD.
1	This record will NOT sell. Bad reviews all across the board.  I was able to see them live opening for Alter Bridge, and they were amazing!  What is this guys?  Experimental album?  And the rockin album will be out this summer right??
1	Don't be fooled people. Oooo she's so hardcore! She's rock/punk/grunge! Oh, her and Avril are pop music's answer to Nirvana! Hahahhaha. Excuse me while I puke. FeFe Dobson, or as I prefer FuFu Dogson is about as predictable as a Jessica Simpson. These many pop-punk acts that tear away at our music industry are just as manufactured as the blonde belly-baring pop-tarts that came out in the late '90s. You want a real female rock antidote to Britney Spears? Go out and immearse yourself in early Liz Phair, Hole, Veruca Salt, L7, Alanis Morisette, Bikini Kill, PJ Harvey, Babes In Toyland or Garbage. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There were so many great female rock bands out in the early to mid '90s that faded away after bubblegum pop came out. I truly wonder what would happen if one of these FeFe fans actually listened to any of the artists' music I mentioned above. Chances are they simply would not 'get it' or their heads would explode because it is too 'harsh' for them.
1	FILTHY!! I never expected this from a Jonas!! It may be an edited version, but the insert with the words to the songs still has a filthy word slightly bleeped out that any person from a child on up could figure out, and the suggestiveness of the songs are not something I care to listen to, and I certainly wouldn't want my young daughter or son to sing to those songs. :( BAD move on the part of Nick Jonas. He could have done such a better job. I miss the fun, and thought provoking songs he used to sing, with and without his brothers. I would NOT recommend this to anyone, and I am going to toss this in the garbage. Just because someone grows up doesn't mean they have to become like the world. Please sing nice songs that no one should be ashamed to sing.
1	Let me get this out of the way, "In da club" is one of the best club songs of all time. Whew! Now,this album is filled with such crap it makes me sick. The only other good tracks are "Many men", "Backdown", and "Wangsta". The rest of the tracks are just repeated attemps to get a single. Real "thugs" don't name drop, brag or boast about the things they needed to do to survive. 50 is the platinum plus performance thug he so desperatley tries to critisize. Burn it, copy it from a friend or just turn on the radio; but do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.
1	Just a brief comment to say that the very reason I so loved the first two albums is the very thing they deleted in their third. I wish I had known this but I pre-ordered based on my expectations, so there you have it. I won't make that mistake again. If you want music that sounds just like everything else on the radio, then this is just the thing..
1	I have absolutely loved the 2 Pink Martini releases I have in my collection.  The group has shown such musicianship, creativity, and depth.  I was SO looking forward to hearing Splendor in the Grass. . . .  As my husband noted after about 2 songs:  What, is this a Pepsi commercial?  Boring, flat, elevator music--the whole disc is a disappointment, and we could barely make it through.
1	Less than stellar seletion of performers and some of the arrangements were a bit stilted.  Nice for background music - would not suggest one concentrate too much.
1	Don't care for the lyrics.  Someone recommended it for a Father's Day program.
1	This is the most worthless piece (of u know what)!  Ive been i huge DT fan from day 1 and i will not get back the time i lost trying to listen to this.....huge waste of time and money!
1	Not what I thought.
1	I bought the album to learn the songs but you can hardly understand the words. Beautiful male bass and tenor voices if you like that sort of thing.
1	Terrible on hold music.
1	(actually 2 1/2 stars) This album is just what you would expect, I suppose, from the author of Martha My Dear and Why Don't We Do It In The Road...McCartney has always been about having a good time, best foot  forward and all that, and I'm sure that the idea at the time was to record  an upbeat, homey-sounding little record with off-the-cuff spontaneity.  Well, sink me if that isn't what he did! I think one problem with Wild  Life, though, is that Paul was still a bit down in the dumps about his  still-recent divorce from the other three lads, and with Lennon taking  potshots at him in the press along with the lackluster reception for  Ram...well, even the normally bubbly Macca's self confidence must have been  running a bit low. The uncertainty is a bit palpable all over Wild Life;  Mumbo, for example, might have been a scorching rocker if Paulie had been  bothered to write some lyrics and do a couple more takes; Dear Friend is a  conflicted counter-attack on Mr. Ono Lennon without a whole lot of  conviction; Paul comes across as hesitant to really let loose on his  erstwhile bandmate. Bip Bop...well, let's just say it lives up to it's  title...I must admit at odd times, usually when in my cups, I'll go around  humming its absurdly catchy tune. Lyrics? well,they're better than the ones  for Mumbo...I'll let it go at that. OK, I'm being a bit snide, I  know...there is some good stuff here; I really like Tomorrow, with those  nice, echoey BV's from the McCartneys that used to be a highlight (to me,  anyway) of Paul's pre-Venus And Mars output; the cover of Love Is Strange  is...well, lovely but strange. Some People Never Know has a pretty melody,  but Linda was just a little too much up front in the mix...again, some  second takes might have helped here. Really, to me, only the painfully flat  I Am Your Singer is unlistenable. Do I recommend you spend your hard earned  cash on Wings Wild Life? Well, be forewarned that only the staunchest  Beatlefans (of which yours truly counts himself amongst same) will really  enjoy it. This was definitely one of Mr. Mc's valleys,and the curious buyer  should take this into consideration. It becomes a better bargain, though,  if this import version has the same bonus tracks as the US release several  years ago (the nice folks at Amazon.com didn't provide a track listing for  this release)...I've always had a soft spot for his covert f-you to his  critics Mary Had A Little Lamb, and its B-side Little Woman Love is a  rollicking number that would have improved Wild Life considerably. So there  you go!
1	I have 24 Emmylou Harris albums. This one stands out as my one and only weak Emmylou Harris album. There are a few strong songs - The Road, My Name is Emmett Till, New Orleans (don't like the drums), and The Ship on His Arm. Big Black Dog is a dog. Darlin' Kate is nearly a good song ... the "sailing" word doesn't seem to work. Nobody is a goodish song ... not keen on the chorus, nor the drums and shaker. The rest of the songs are weak, and often the drums (and shaker) are boring.
1	This review is for the cd and not for the sellers.  I love Fiedlers music but all the music in this cd is not for easy listening and or to play while lounging.  I am surprised because I have other  of his cds that are very nice to listen to. Too bad.
1	This order had to be placed while someone was trying to use my charge card illegally and had to stop the account because of it:-(  I was not a happy camper when I found out this happened to me..........
1	Boring Boring Boring...... i should have listened to samples before i bought this.... when i heard it was modern surf music i was sold! But Bill Frisell took every slow romantic surf tune and put an icky country twang on it.  I was looking for something fun and exciting.... you know.... like surfing is.  It is well done.... but not the music that i was expecting.
1	Albums were to fat scratch to play normal. I paid cheap and I got the cheap. It is very important to read everything through before ordering.
1	Can't give rating because this was supposed to download to my mobile phone and my mobile phone never received it !!!  Really getting tired of Amazon! To many times I've had problems with an order and too many problems trying to return an order! I've pd for this song and have nothing to shoe for it!!
1	only the theme from strike back tv series worth listening to in my opinion.
1	Not nearly as good as her first. Very different tone and sound. Not a fan.
1	Received cd today. Plastic is ripped and case is cracked on the bottom side. This is a Christmas gift and now I have to give it damaged 
1	not as good as original
1	To be honest, I'm very disappointed in it. I thought this album was going to be like their Youtube channel but it's not. The problem is that they actually made a professional recording and in doing so, they removed all the imperfections that made the music great. It's been cleaned up too much and it doesn't sound authentic.
1	Valley girl ranting surrounded by music that sounds roughly like Nintendo farts in the background.  Awful.  You are better off buying the Ethel Merman disco album instead.
1	I downloaded this as part of some free $5 Amazon rebate.  And, I questioned whether I'd be happy with someone else's decision about compression.  My suspicions were confirmed.  Compression of classical music removes the depth and dynamics.  It's suitable for listening in a car, but not on a higher end system.  Also, each track is a separate file.  That is fine, and even desirable for most non-classical recordings.  For classical recordings, that is annoying.  I didn't want to go through the hassles of recombining all the tracks into a single track so I could listen to the entire piece in the proper order.  Ideally, an ISO download would be best. Then, I could control how I wanted it compressed (if at all) and the playback order.  I wouldn't do this again, unless I could get an ISO file.
1	What happens when you take Dr Dre's gangsta's voice/lyrics and cross it with Eminem's deminor/"witty" word play? To tell you the truth, I don't really know. I guess you get 50 cent. 50 cent: to be truthful, is pretty wack. That isn't really a bad thing - But his gun tokin' lyrics have a funny sence to hit. Songs like "U Not Like Me" have this funny personality, but gangsta lyrics. Maybe because 50 cent has expierenced the "thug" life - it's just a funny subject to him? Can't be taken seriously? Perhaps. But that is mainly why this cd gets 2 stars - Because he takes "used to be" serious subjects, like being shot, stabed, robed, put in jail, oppressed against - and makes it into a funny subject manner. The last "real" subject that rap has left, and 50 cent is f*ckin' around with it - Tryin' to make it sound like its no big deal - When it *reality* it is a big deal. And this is why he will never be 2pac. 2pac took what happen in his life seriously. He took like a lesson - and expressed it seriously. 50 cent on the other hand, is talking like taking 9 shots is funny. That to me is pretty wack. But other then that. His "dumb found" flow is catchy. The beats are cool and catchy as well. "High all the Time" "U Not Like ME" "Back Down" are pretty good songs. Personally - I didn't like "In Da Club" - and Eminem's producing is just wack. Whats with all the strings and trumpets? In conclusion - An entertaining album - But 50 needs to wise up, if expects to stay hot.
1	I am playing Susan Boyle's The Gift for the first and last time.  If I had a way to play it that stripped out all but her voice, it would be a terrific album.  The orchestration behind her should be subtle, not take over the whole album.  How sad that she's not allowed to use HER gift.
1	Junk... Hello Amazon, you've been stalking me and collecting my data for several years now. What ever gave you the idea that I might want to listen to any of the garbage you just tried to pawn off on me? 2 months left until my membership ends and it's bye-bye
1	What happened to the Waltz? It is mostly gone. I had the original lp when movie came out and knee the recording by heart and this is not the same.
1	Last year's American Idol winner, Jordin Sparks, really hasn't hit the nail on the head with great songs on her debut. While her debut single Tattoo was a fair song, it just hasn't shown that she has stood out well to compete with greats like Alicia Keys or newcomer Chrisette Michele. Her second single from that album, No Air with rising Hip Hop star Chris Brown, doesn't work well either. While the song has a fairly nice beat, it just doesn't seem to be an everlasting song that stands out. On top of that, the duet doesn't actually show that there is complete chemistry like other classics. I just honestly think she has a good talent, but needs to find better footing for the long run. Her next single needs to do a much better job at sealing the deal.  Song: D+
1	Could not download
1	This CD is a karaoke version of the original, it's not Teresa Teng singing the songs.
1	Sorry but their voices don't compliment each other... wish I hadn't purchased it :(
1	i must have been drunk when i bought this?
1	The main tune in the preview is by Kevin Macleod and is called "Deliberate Thought". You can get it for free from his website at  [...]
1	This file is of a very poor quality, it reminds me of the vinyl LP's because there is so much static over the complete track.
1	Rape apologists obviously can't make music.  Don't bother with this crap.  Karma's a b%#$&
1	Not the version I wanted.
1	Obviously a great album, however being an Amazon prime member, and this being a prime product, I expect the free 2 day shipping (as noted in description). Just received the item in the 5th day at almost 7 pm. Highly suggest purchasing this album from the band themselves.
1	Mediocre compared to other tributes.  Just didn't enjoy these renditions the same way I have other vsq performances
1	AFTER SCHOOL SESSION/ONE DOZEN BERRIES Despite the 'mono' designation on the jacket, these 2 LP's are in fake stereo which sounds terrible. They are packaged in a gatefold jacket, with very thin paper as most LPs from Europe tend to be. This set is NOT worth $45. I'd sell it at most for $5.
1	Was not able to download it to my library
1	while i consider his first album a masterpiece, this one i can hardly listen to. only 2 songs work for me, those being "so strong" and "rock stone". everything else is an instant skip.
1	The star rating of my review is NOT for the actual music on this album. This is a great album and I highly recommend it to Gabriel fans. My problem is with the appearent inability for the venders and people selling this album to figure out that they need to sell BOTH DISCS TOGETHER. For the SECOND time now, I have only received disc 2! This is a TWO DISC SET! If I buy a product that specifically says "Disc 1 & 2," I expect to receive DISCS 1 & 2!! For those of you who are not aware, each disc comes in its own, single disc jewel case with its own booklet and inserts. If you are selling this item, be sure that you have both of them. It clearly says "Disc 1" and "Disc 2" on the cover of each booklet. If you only have one of the discs, SAY SO IN YOUR PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. By the looks of it, there are several other sellers who only appear to have one of the 2 discs for sale, based on their descriptions. SELL BOTH DISCS OR SAY THAT YOU ONLY HAVE ONE OF THEM!!!!!!!!!! I know it seems I'm harping on this, but I'm not the only one this has happened to, so I just wanted to make my point clear.
1	It's unfortunate that I can't give this 0 stars, also Joe, depression is no laughing matter, you hack!
1	One of the worst recorded set of vocals I have ever heard (over 60 years of listening).  The voice is as if recorded through or in a very large drainage pipe or cavern.  Any CD vocals from the forties, or even thirties, I've listened to sound better than this 2005-produced mess.  What a disservice to a likely deserving vocalist; what a waste of purchasers' money.  This item also available through the label company at a drastically lower price.  Don't say you weren't advised.  ****
1	Unlistenable. The glorious voices are interrupted continuously by the prompter. Recording microphones are in close proximity to him. To Legato Classics credit, they make this issue very clear on the BACK of the CD. Do Not PURCHASE.
1	VERY dissapponted. They cut out the last few seconds of the song where Freddy says "Your DJ is MINE now Prince-y ... Ha Ha Ha Ha!!"  That was the best part of the song. Shame on you amazon.com
1	Amy Grant is awesome...I have her albums...the Best songs I love is "the arms of love" and Imagine/
1	Actually I really like a lot of the songs and Smoke + Mirrors even more so, but the producer should be flogged for his destruction of the sound quality. Both albums contain grotesque amounts of subsonic noise right down to speaker destroying 5Hz add to that a continous digital clipping covering 95% of the duration of the songs.
1	I thought this album was a CD and not a record. MY MISTAKE.
1	I want to obtain a CD of his singing TINY BUBBLES.
1	Hearing the guitar player drag their fingers over the strings is NOT relaxing. It grates on the nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard. Whoever played the first selection is NOT a musician. They are a butcher.
1	A physically attractive person, but the song lacks depth. Sounds like one long run on sentence with the music drowing her out.
1	Thought I was purchasing the song... It was only the first 2 verses of the song and the rest is just part of actual show... Still ok to listen to but not what I wanted
1	ive been a dylan fan since 1964 , i was 13, but this album  , well aint good...
1	THESE ARE NOT RUNNING CADENCE AS ADVERTISED ON THE FRONT LOGO. THESE ARE MARCHING CADENCE.
1	ugh
1	Just not what I expected and I do not like it!  Regret this purchase.  I expected more soothing music to meditate by.
1	Don't know why this is hear.  I didn't buy it???
1	awful
1	Probably the worst thing I have ever heard. Who the hell wants to do the "stanky leg"? That sounds weird to me. Extremely weird. These guys suck.
1	ok
1	I'm still waiting for Slipknot to put out a new album.
1	I seriously tried to make a go at this album...I just can't get into it - always waiting for a good jam but then wind up hearing lyrics...I mean the graphics on the cover are better than the music.  What a shame!  Lycrics don't go with their type of sound.  We all listen to TSO for their cool twist on the sounds of Christmas - not listening to some dude that doesn't go with the guitars etc.  Not happy at all!!!
1	This version is not the same as the original and the vocals sound like they are done by Weird Al Yankovic.  Buy the track from the original EP instead.
1	Couldn't use it for what I wanted it for.
1	The download had terrible sound quality .
1	short pieces of the best music--too chopped up---not enough of the best music for a great movie--would not buy again
1	52 seconds long!  Wish I would have noticed that before I bought it!  Not worth it!  Sorry.
1	Wasn't what I thought,.. really weird...
1	Ok I am cool with the reggaeton sound and the movement but this guy goes and gives us an ENTIRE cd of reggaeton. Gone are the days of NORE the rapper he COMPLETELY flips the script on this cd and I didn't see it coming, thats all I am saying. He didn't have any singles for reason.
1	It's OK to be a pretender when you're acting, but not when making music. Stick to acting.
1	This album is as self hating and Andy Kindler is. They are both in great company with each other since neither have any sort of career so neither will make each other jealous. Not even blacks are coming to the rescue Joe
1	If you're looking at this track, you already know what it sounds like.  There is nothing wrong with the download in terms of quality.  The problem is that this is just a short 2:53 cut, not the entire 17 minute monstrosity.  Maybe some other download service has the whole thing.
1	I wish I could just give an asterisk instead of a star for this record.  I just don't get it.  Can't listen to it, can't get through it, can't own it.  Makes me think Nickleback, All American Rejects, and Five for Fighting are pretty good bands.  I hate those bands.  Paul, sit down at a piano, try something else, this ain't happenin anymore.
1	As a movie soundtrack fan, I will not download this album though I'm really dying to own it.  why?  because MP3 does not do justice to music in general, orchestral music in particular. MP3 compression damages the sound quality, in the high and low register, minimizes sound depths and reduces reverb and all sort of details that make the music feel more lively.  I won't pay for MP3 quality music which anyway costs nearly the same as a physical CD.  and too bad I won't be able to own this score but I don't want to give in to that Disney statement that physical CDs are not commercially viable nomore. After all, I suppose the main costs of a CD is not the CD itself, but the production of the music itself.  and since the production cost incurred to the movie production budget anyway, why couldn't Disney release a limited number of factory-produced CDs for fans? (who, as I understand from the other comments, are many!)
1	When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired--it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me."
1	I got this song when I recently downloaded some Mp3. I didn't want it, I didn't listen to it, I don't understand why Amazon is doing this, the track also shows up in your profile as a 'recently purchased item' Not cool Amazon!!!
1	I bought this cd because I like Mystikal . What horrible sound Ronson has! Thin as water. There's no body in the music. Mystikal should be furious. Nothing to sink your teeth into here. Horrible reproduction of mp3 sound which naturally eliminates most of the bottom end. Why? Why??? James Brown never had crap for sound. He'd beat the sound man if he ever heard such atrocious sound. Mr. Ronson needs to get musicians and lose the cheesy keyboards. Blecch.
1	The CD was fine. Disappointed by the actual music because the songs were sung by a generic singer - I guess its partially my fault since I didn't look into the artists but they weren't listed in the descriptiojn. The description should say the songs are renditions of the famous songs, by the same singer. I didn't think the music sounded anything like the original songs so I'll be buying another CD that has the actual songs I was looking for.
1	My husband and I were hoping to use this song for a picture movie in church - the song has protections on it to prevent it from being used this way.
1	For me, this was an INcomplete set.  When I downloaded it, 23 tracks were missing.  I called customer service, we determined it was not a problem on my end, it was "escalated" and now, over a month later, I have received no help whatsoever.  So I just called and got a refund.  Which is a pity because I was looking forward to this.
1	I was really hoping my complaints about the previous release had been heard by Disney. Alas, I was blinded by hope. This release suffers from the same issues as the previous release, "Four Parks, One World" and while it's clear they attempted to try and remedy the issue, the issues that still exist are far to powerful to allow me to overlook them and give it the "okay" this time. I just don't like it.  The main reason behind this... call it childish, but it's because they didn't release that one track I had be dying for on the disc. That is an updated mix of Grim Grinning Ghosts from the Haunted Mansion. In 2007, the ride was give a massive refurbishment that saw the installation of may improvements to the ride's soundtrack and sound system. One of the more notable additions was the re-recording of several vocal tracks used in the ride's musical graveyard finale. The new vocal tracks sound far less dated, and add a great deal of quality to the overall soundscape of the scene. All the performances sound much more lively and involved. But alas, we are present with the same old mix that we have been getting since official park albums became a thing back in the 1990's and 2000's. The vocals are the pre-2007, dated versions. Not only are the vocal tracks not the ones used at Walt Disney World, but even the key of the Foyer Organ music is off! All the little details really do matter! I do not have room for another one of these 'same old' mixes in my collection!  ** Randy Thorton, please hear me out! Release a single on amazon of "Grim Grinning Ghosts: The Re-Haunting", with the new vocal tracks (similar to the "999 Happy Haunts" track off the Haunted Mansion album from 2009) It would be a dream come true! Isn't Disney all about making dreams come true? Plus, I guarantee you it will sell. I know plenty of others who are just dying to own a copy of the new vocals! I know I would be willing to pay upwards of at least $50 if that was what you were charging for it.**  This is the same issue I have with "Yo-Ho, A Pirate's Life for Me" on the CD. Not only was the instrumental updated in 2006 or 2007, but the ride has never used the "Scare Me Music" heard in the mix! Only Disneyland uses that music! These issues of using the same track for both releases to save on time has to stop! Any true fan will notice these issues, and for those who buy both the Walt Disney World album AND the Disneyland Album, it's a real hindrance. I don't need two of the same track, especially when the versions of the song used in the rides are different at each park! This favoring Disneyland and just tossing the same mix onto the Walt Disney World release needs to end now, or I will not be buying another official album ever again.  Then come my issues with the Digital release of the album. Any of the "new" tracks that are actually worth getting aren't available unless you buy the whole album. You can't get "Ariel's Undersea Voyage" soundtrack unless you buy the whole album. I already have most of the tracks on it. Why are you making me waste nearly $20 just to get a handful of new stuff?  The following tracks are not new in any way, and have already been released at least once before, and many of them several times prior:  Disc 1:  1. All Aboard! 2. Flitterin' 3. The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room 4. Swissapolka 5. Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life For Me) 6. Bear Band Serenade 7. Splash Mountain Medley 8. Grim Grinning Ghosts 9. It's a Small World 10. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh 15. There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow 16. Galactic Anthem 17. Spaceship Earth 18. Energy Adventure Medley 19. One Little Spark  Disc 2:  1. Destiny 3. The Seas with Nemo and Friends Medley 4. Soarin' 5. Canada (You're a Lifetime Journey) 6. Impressions De France 7. Golden Dream 8. Reflections of China Suite 9. The Three Caballeros 10. The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror Theme 12. Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular 13. Lights, Motor, Action 16. It's Tough To Be a Bug 17. CTX Theme  So for 36 tracks, 28 of which any dedicated Disney Park audio collector already has, we are expected to turn over a good $19.00 to get seven new tracks? Does that sound like a fair deal? No, it doesn't...  Finally, several other new tracks didn't find there way onto the album, like Space Mountain's all new "Starry-O-Phonic Sound" or the new Main Street Electrical Parade Melody, (not the version found on the official release here on Amazon; the Walt Disney World version uses a custom mix featuring exclusive tracks and some from Tokyo Disneyland's Dreamlights, all re-orchestrated) and others.  I sincerely hope my complaints are heard. I really like to support the release of official park audio, but if you continue to treat your hardcore fans like dirt, you're not going to see their money. I'm not breaking down and buying the next one unless the issues get fixed!
1	If you are looking for funeral music, this CD will fill the bill. Neither the composer nor the artist of the CD cover know anything about meditation, which in my mind is about enlightenment, not synthesized brooding and sorrow. The third track seemed headed for redemption, but fell back into the gloom.  Sending it back.  I would recommend Mozart's Requiem.
1	The sound quality on this particular MP3 version sounds like it was converted from a cassette tame left in the sun too long.  A real shame.
1	The only reason I purchased this song was because my sister wanted it on a compilation CD she wanted me to make for her, otherwise I would have nothing to do with it.
1	Leftovers :(((((
1	This CD is very disappointing. For all of the hype around Jennifer Hudson, I expected a stellar debut on par with Whitney Houston's classic. Jennifer's CD suffers from mediocre, lazy material and ill-conceived collaborations. The song with T-Pain is beyond terrible, and the "Pocketbook" song with Ludacris is equally bad. "I'm His Only Woman" would have been a decent song, but it is such a blatant rip-off of Shirley Brown's soul classic "Woman To Woman" that I can't even take it seriously. I'm thoroughly disappointed with this CD.
1	Good cd but the mp3 download is terrible. I've been buying from Amazon MP3 for 6-7 years and this is not up to par with the others I've bought. It sounds like you are listening to FM radio.
1	I was looking for a contemporary interpretation of Twilight Time, so I gave this one a shot. It is terrible, she shouldn't have sung it at all.
1	Sorry, what I would really like is a new release from Mr. Bungle!
1	I get it, but I don't like the track.
1	For some reason, the mp3 version of Mad World has very noticeable distortions. I would look elsewhere for a higher quality version.
1	I love this song but this version on Amazon has 2 pauses in it. I thought maybe it was my service connection but after playing on repeat (I did mention I liked it , right?) it paused in the same place every time. Buy another version.
1	When it has came down to Nicki Minaj, she has really came out with some very awful songs that show that she not only does not know how to sing, but drive in good songs either. Pound Te Alarm, the latest single from Nicki's album Roman Reloaded isn't really a driven song. It feels very weak and not exciting. She really doesn't have something that makes her driven in her voice. She really has shown that she doesn't have the talent in her voice. It feels more like what she tried to prove with starships earlier this year, it feels like it was honestly wasted away. Well, it won't happen with her next single either. Maybe she should find a new change of pace for herself. Something else that would make you pound the alarm.  Song: D-
1	This song is supposed to be a summer love song, that's sweet and cute, but let me say, Taylor Swift blows this out of the water, and half-way across Asia. Ironically, the two are doing a duet, which is like Rosie O' Donnell doing a duet with Leona Lewis. Totally mismatched.  All sarcasm aside, the song has more cheese than Wisconsin, more horrid sounds than a Chinese takeout kitchen, and more annoyingness than Rosanne. Really, whenever I'm forced to listen to this song at the gas station, I want to light a match, and drop it.  Boyce Avenue's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for, but it's still a 4-star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history. What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it's sort of catchy. It's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity. So in summarizing, don't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds, because you'll choke, and don't listen while you're depressed, because you'll kill yourself. Like drugs, JUST SAY NO!
1	Do not buy unless YOU want to waste 99 cents. This is NOT the original 1983 single release at all. Re-Recorded Junk is the proper description!
1	ITS BS Amazon forces you to download their software medial player in order to download the music you paid for. I don't want their media player. I will never buy music from Amazon again.
1	Didn't work for me.  I found it more annoying and creepy than relaxing.  I'll give it 2 stars for the price.
1	Love that I received a free download for myself.
1	The sound quality is very poor .....don't but songs from this album. This has nothing to do w/ my Kindle - other songs purchased the same night sound great. Thought it was just the song so I bought another song from this album - same poor quality for sound!!
1	don't use this file it is corrupt and has a hole of silence not far from the beginning. it cost me more money to come in here and download the only other file which happens to cost more!!! rip off!!
1	The artists listed for this album, Monster New Wave Hits, is identified as A Flock of Seagulls online. But when playing the selection it does NOT sound like the original artists, and the media player identifies them as "various artists". I believe it's a knockoff imitation, and probably the other "hits" are as well. BEWARE.
1	Boy is this album terrible. Children may love this but parents and adults have to hate this. Kidz Bop is worse than listening to Bing Crosby and Barry Manilow. I'd rather listen to Barry Manilow than this horrid franchise. I can't imagine any parents liking this album.
1	Used to love eminem, but I dotn like more than half of his new music, Im not a hater , I just like rap not pop, and I prefer rap over hiphop too. But this song pissed me off so much, it truly ruined eminem for me, I won't be checking for Em's next album, hopefuly artists like Kendrick Lamar will save rap, and not used pop singers to get hits in their songs
1	This was a defective CD, read by my car stereo as being unreadable and by my computer as being a blank CD. CD has no scratches, looks like it has been finished but there's no way of accessing the info on it.
1	Ok, so it ultra new age and designed for meditation, etc.  It still doesn't work for me but that may be just personal.
1	Unfortunately I will be going against the grain here. I am not ecstatic about this over polished hushed down gospel performance. I am a huge blues fan with well over a thousand blues cds but this one won't be joining them. To me this is the Starbucks crowd version of the blues which they often refer to as soulful. Tracy Chapman is another who comes to mind but then again I think producer Meshell Ndegeocello is way overrated too for the same reasons. The material is decent but the singing is too mannered for my liking and the somber production which is supposed to give the whole thing gravitas just lacks spontaneity.  If you're under 35, this is for you. If you are a true blues fan, pass.
1	Where to start.... Sum 41 is guilty of so many musical atrocities that it is difficult to summarize here without the risk of developing carpal tunnel. Fortunately their flagrant unoriginality alone gives me fodder enough for a satisfactory review. Let me first say that I don't expect every musical effort put forth in this world to be original. We all know there is nothing new under the sun, and in the quest to be original, many artists simply end up alienating all audiences. So I grant that every band today must borrow some from previous groups. However, if you are going to copy somebody at least copy somebody good. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Sum 41 must be charter members of the Blink 182 fan club. Blink 182 (despite what your 17 year old daughter might say) is not good, and this is why I can't understand Sum 41. Why do they insist on copying bad music? There is a reason there are no Fine Young Cannibals cover bands out there. Bad music is not to be imitated! Now, as for the song "Fat Lip," the first time I heard it, I didn't know whether the lyrics were sincere or sarcastic. Apparently they are for real. Look at the lyrics. It's like they read a book entitled "How to Write Punk Lyrics," before etching out this one. They covered all the bases: Conformity, society, falling in line- you know, all the hits. Memo to Sum 41. The punk revolution already happened and YOU WEREN'T THERE! And the ultimate irony is that in their quest to combat conformity, they in fact fall right in line alongside Blink 182, as mainstream as you can get.
1	It's MODIFIED!!! I don't know why, but this is not the original version of this song. *if my duffer bag don't mind, it's time to go' isn't even in this version for some reason. What a waste.  I'm confused - why just randomly change a classic song???
1	I am not happy..i purchased it new...so the box i checked said..not new..its opened and its a colecters item for me. Would of never bought it if i new it was opened..i wouldnt have opened it...
1	There is a reason it was free
1	Love Talking Heads and have the live version of this song which has a great best to it. Was dissapointed in the LP version.
1	I'm a big fan of Sharon Jones and I absolutely love Christmas music, but not a fan of this album at all.  It really did not do anything for me.  I saw it as a big missed opportunity.  This is just my opinion, so sample it before you decide to buy it or not.  I'm sure many people loved it.
1	If your little one insists on watching the show then you already know all the songs, they are no different (though the credits one is slightly extended). You can line yourself to be subjected to / enjoy the songs at other times too, by buying this album. With the songs little more than a minute long and with specific themes, it's not the most listenable record ever, but good for a quick song. However 14 and a half minutes of music at $9 is 62 per minute of music, and you don't even get a physical copy for your child to throw around and ultimately break. Although the songs are nice and well crafted, that's a bit too expensive in my book. Note that the other, longer album is FREE if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, so you might want to just try and make do with that one.
1	NOT VERY GOOD CD
1	This 3 CD Comp- is horrible as it re-recorded with terrible versions-find the real deal in this Amazon Digital Section and be sure to check out the snipet of songs as they are the critical basis for your deciding to purchase or not and this is surely not that
1	was very upset when i recieved the cd the case was cracked. when i buy something new i expect it not to have cracks...
1	If I could give it 0 stars, I would. They should have edited out all the BS talking and clapping. If I wanted a story MP3 I would have bought one. Singer/Songwriters stories are OK but when you download them you are forced to listen to their BS every time you listen to it. They are neither funny or interesting the 50th time. It is a shame because I really like his songs and was looking forward to an acoustic version of them
1	Didn't mean to order.
1	Great voice, nice music; within minutes I was sold on this, beginning to get relaxed for real and then.....I was instructed to see The Archangel Michael on my shoulder. Sorry--instant total fail. If you're into or at least can tolerate angels, this is probably a 4- or 5-star recording. For me, not so much. Good luck.
1	If one looks at reviews for most albums they are usually positive--even for some of the least regarded artists and albums.  I don't know how to account for that.  It may be that in today's market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they aren't likely to end up with something they don't like, unlike in times past.  I received this album as a gift.  This group has a unique sound for our current times and harks back to many musical tributaries of American popular music--soul, R&B , Rock. Folk etc.  Like CCR in the late 60's they are staking out a musical territory that most artists ignore and for that Alabama Shakes deserves credit and attention.  This group also grabs your attention in that it's a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar--which is unusual, to be frank. This band has a lot going for it and this album is very "atmospheric", but unlike CCR this album is tuneless.  In fact I found it drudgery trying to get through the whole thing for a listen---I have listened to it twice.  Not sure if I can do it one more time, but I will, because I always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will "grow" on me.  I really want to like this group, but so far nothing attracts my ear or sticks in my head.  I'll come back to update this review if  it grows on me.
1	This is an awful song. How many times can you say Radioactive in one song? It has no meaning, and stylistically is atrocious.
1	This is another example of the music industry trying to get the consumer  to invest in the purchase of multiple soundtrack albums of the same movie.  I bought this album because of my curiousity in the track listing (of which  there are 10 tracks listed).  I already have another CD in my collection --  also titled "RAMBO III: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack", but  it contains 23 tracks instead of 10 and has a different jacket cover.  If  you are a fan of the "Rambo" music or like the compositions of  Jerry Goldsmith, you probably aren't going to be happy with this CD.  Although Amazon doesn't list the 23 track "Original Motion Picture  Soundtrack" like I have, you might want to best spend your dollars at  an auction site or "rare" web sites that offer the complete  version.
1	what a garbage this band is! the answer of the german teeny girl band for SPICE GIRLS in the UK. The girls are pretty but they do not show us any capability how they could play any of instruments on stage, and neither they could read any of the musical notes. the germans keep on saying "SCHROTT"
1	I've been unable to play the song.
1	I didn't know will.i.am was Jewish.  What a stupid song.  Terrible lyrics (that don't fit the measures) forced into a mediocre song.  Hooray for everything!
1	This recording isn't the kind of thing you want as background music at a cocktail party.  It is very slow and rather sad.  Of course, if you like that sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you like.
1	Why buy a song if you can enjoy this anti-semitic nonsense for free on YouTube...
1	what part of 3 songs constitutes an album -free on not.  please be honest with your customers we are not idiots, well some are
1	In one word the way to describe this album is "Generic". I'm not saying I didn't like it but honestly they lost track of who they really are. We came as romans is supposed to be a symbol of hope and originality for the music industry, but they completely sold out themselves for this album. Remember their past albums? How they had long songs which usually incorporated awesome instrumentals with technical sounds that just were plain bada$$. But with this album they hardly use any technical sounds and the lyrics make for generic crap you would hear in a three days grace album (not a diss, just a fact they have generic lyrics). I saw an interview where they talked about how the producer of this album made them scrap all their work and make 30 new works (which only 10 made it on.. Seriously...10......). Since when did this band listen to others on what their music should sound like? They dropped the ball with this album despite the few songs which I enjoyed.
1	What is the difference between this album and epilogue young forever which is the better one?
1	Music & Album get 5 stars. Unfortunately I was sent 2 blank discs, by the 2nd blank I realized I could download with Amazon's music download app, which I then burned to the blank they sent me. I pay data rates for downloads using my satellite internet, which is why I purchased the CD to begin with.  The music however is great! It's fun and entertaining, and great to drive to. It is exciting yet relaxing, in that it is constantly changing, the sounds and beats meld together in a seamless fashion that sounds great to the ear. I'm going to go dance with my girlfriend for a bit. See ya!
1	The title says it all, the clip is so quiet you can barely hear it. What a waste of $. Love the song but so disapointed in the quality of the clip!
1	This one for me is off the beaten path, in a not so good way.  I liked How We Quit the Forest thru Frustration Plantation best.  The latter albums mentioned are funner and the concerts were fun too.  This latest album doesn't turn me off to Rasputina as I know new every album has something different to taste.  I do look forward to more releases. Can't wait to get torched for my contrary opinion.  'Opinion'.  Look it up.
1	Did I buy this? Oh my god wtf
1	I'd like my song!!
1	I'm not sure what happened but I heard the song on Pandora and decided to buy it. When it downloaded, it was not the song I was listening to at all. Would like a refund
1	Got the wrong version.  My fault.  Deleted after 3min of disappointment.
1	Although I was never a big fan of Jewel, I was suprised that Jewel, of all people, would sell herself out to commericalism. I never thought I would see the day that Jewel would turn herself into a Britney Spears knockoff just to get airplay on top 40 radio.  What's next?  Torn (Remix) by Natalie Imbruglia feat. 50 Cent? This album is worth borrowing from a friend.  Not because of the talent, but so you can understand what commericalism can do to a once talented artist.  The album is interesting only the way a car wreck is interesting.  0304 is the kind of album I'd expect from a debut artist, not someone like Jewel.  0304 is what happens when artists listen to executives in the boardroom instead of their fans.
1	Not my favorite holiday CD. Sorry..
1	song
1	I do Radio spots for different clients. I had to buy this for a spot I did.  I do not like this band or their music on a personal level.
1	Liked the clip of this song, used as the opening for the British show "Misfits," but I was disappointed that it turns into complete noise for a long section. Stopped listening to it all together.
1	makes me wanna start moonwalking around the Christmas tree! ridiculously horrible, played out yuletide turd!
1	I liked the first one better more hit's this one not so much.
1	Explicit lyrics  - who need them?
1	There is not a single artist I would listen to.
1	This CD is probably the most overrated album in the history of rap. face it people, 50 is not the next Tupac and this album proves it. If I hear 'In the Club' one more time I'm going to kill myself. The only reason there is as much hype behind this album as there is because of Eminem and Dre's production. I liked his first single 'Wanksta' and the Ja Rule diss song was stupid but kinda funny. I'm not a big Ja Rule fan but he's better than 50. In the Club is just straight up retarded (go shorty, it's ya birthday. what the hell is he talking about) The only reason anybody likes '21 Questions' is because Nate Dogg is a bad ... and steals the show. 50 has no range as a rapper. A good rapper can speed up his flow on occasion and slow it down when needed. 50 has one speed and never changes. I support every rapper that disses 50 now, Scarface, Ghostface, Ja, Sticky Fingaz. I really wish people would buy CDs from geniuses like the Wu Tang Clan, Gang Starr, and  Sticky Fingaz instead of wasting their money on overhyped trash like this.
1	I'm sad to disagree with most of the reviewers here, but I hated it. I didn't even finish listening to it.
1	This falls into the "it's so bad it's funny" category so at least the cd was enjoyable for the laughter.  I'm really hoping for a disco album next....like Ethel Merman did....although she had a great loud voice, which he doesn't have.
1	Basic, mid-tempo, drum-a-thumping, sort of rock that may shift some feet while they play live as they tour.  But why oh why couldn't they have named the band anything other than a band that exists in rock history, first as "What is This?" then as "Walk the Moon" and finally as "Eleven".  All three of those bands share roots that travel back 20+ years, with band mates coming and going with Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Sad.  By the time I finished "I Can't Lift A Car" on this CD, the one-note, college anthem rock 'n' roll it is meant to inspire, becomes mega-uninspiring.
1	Great music. Half the discs were damaged, even though listed as 'very good'.
1	the record was scratched when i got record player jumped the first time i played it. i only give it 2 stars because the music is so good
1	This album is a continuation of Dream Theater increasing the percentage of bad ballads on their albums.  Enough with the breathy vocals and playing every instrument imaginable through the synthesizer.  This album is an embarrassment.  Even the heavy songs (most of them) start out with unlistenable breathy vocals and bulls*** excuse for music in the background.  Dream Theater: PLEASE listen to Scenes from a Memory and Train of Thought 1000 times each before making your next album.
1	It's the clean version - didn't specify clean - wasting my time
1	Second purchase, still a lousy recording. Music is fantastic, composition is beautiful, but music cuts off br end.
1	Every song sounded about the same, very disappointed in Flames new cd. I normally love his music.
1	If you want conscious breathing exercises, I would rate this a 5.  Great for someone with asthma or other breathing issues.  Each step is breathing between different points of the body from eye brows to fingers to toes. The problem I had with sleeping was long pauses between vocal instructions distracting pulling the focus to another place.  I bought the CD to get further into conscious deep sleep.  I had the reverse effect.  However, as an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body, the meditation does work.  I feel refreshed yet energized.
1	This is really simple: some not-so-knowledgeable party has titled this track "The Ride of the Walkyries"... when it actually is "The Ride of the Valkyries". How hard is it to check for accuracy?
1	Not too good for my liking
1	What a complete waste of $.99!!! There is absolutely no useful information here. All it says is that you can make money with online surveys but be careful for scams. That's it! But they take a couple of minutes to do it. Save yourself $.99.
1	Different from what I expected
1	Impossible to download,but Amazon got the money
1	sucks!!!
1	All I wanted was just the song part, not the nasty phone call comments made at the end. Very disappointing; I would have given this 0 stars if I could.
1	all the songs I downloaded skip like I am playing a old record?  I downloaded 4 songs
1	When the song begins you feel like great things are on the way.  When it gets going the beat is not as strong as it could be - it feels a little cheap, but Nicki does alright. Not as good as say her verse on "Monster" but eh, not her worst either.  Perhaps the highlight of the song is Mrs. Carter, Beyonce. She kills her parts. Not her strongest performance but even on a poor day she delivers pretty well. The only issue is at points the Beyonce and Nicki part feel really disjointed. Maybe a future collab will go better?
1	I was sent the cassette instead of a cd
1	After listening to other CDs from these to, I was not pleased with these CD. Try again.
1	HATED IT
1	Uh, more like all filler!  This album is so boring, and so irritating I couldn't even stand it!  It's bad enough that there's bands like Weezer and Blink 182 making a mockery of what punk used to be, but now there's yet another one that not only does the same thing, but also mutilates Iron Maiden riffs in the process.  Yes, much like Papa Roach, Sum 41 thought it would be a good idea to mix Iron Maiden with the "radio rock" sound.  But, to me (and to most Maiden fans, I'm sure) it's nothing but a slap in the face.  The song "Pain for Pleasure" is pretty pathetic, really.  I mean yes, it is a pleasant surprise after the whiny vocals and inane lyrics that you have to endure to get to this song, but it's only like a minute long, there's no solo, and even Iron Maiden and Judas Priest at their worst moments is far superior.  I do, however, hope that that song opens doors for some Blink fans, and gets them looking into the world of oldschool metal, but ya never know.  Just the same, though, the "ouch, that song gives me a headache!" comments do make me smile.  To sum up Sum 41, this is just not punk.  If you want to hear some real punk, check out the Misfits or the Ramones, but this is for disciples of TRL.
1	Don't waste your money. You only get a few minutes, if that, of part of the soundtrack. NOT even close to the whole thing.
1	This is the SCORE - NOT the Soundtrack.  Soundtracks have the Songs and sometimes, a bit of the Score.  The Score is usually JUST the Score - sans Songs.  I wish more record companies would get this straight.  In the case of a movie like this, the Score might be nice to have for some people, but the Soundtracks (that is, the SONGS) is what people are looking for.
1	Did someone hand Ma$e a gun? Geez,you know I suppose that is kinda cool that this guy has all this street cred,and maybe that's what gets some you real gangstas to buy this,fair enough,but what's this b.s. w/ this just being what everyone automaticly assumes they need to buy it now? If you're a G,cool,but if not,your a damn tool. For those of us on the other side of hip-hop taste,it's f'n b.s. that all anyone can say to back up this guy for his lack of any real skill is his history, I mean why don't we just start hauling out inmates and give them record deals? Even if gangsta rap is your thing,this c.d. is horrible,admit it. For gangsta, try Snoop,Dogg Pound,Ice Cube,Mack 10,or W.C.. There's better hip-hop out there,even way past gangsta, for those of you who don't see what the heck this hype is all about,because that's all it is,hype.
1	It was great, except it was so badly scratched I had to return it.
1	Someone should explain to the rest of us who appreciate great quality music such as Ratt,Guns n Roses etc. Why lack of talent seems to be mistaken as musical genious?Kurt Cobain was nothing more than a degenerate heroin addict who didn't even know 3 chords on guitar and certainly could not sing. This a perfect example of people buying garbage because they are too stupid to make up thier own minds ans MTV shoved this crap down everyone's throat because it was seen as being trendy. The ONE AND ONLY REASON this genre of music caught on was because every misfit who ever wanted to be in a band but didn't have the talent to play melodic metal and other kinds of music where you have to be able to sing and play saw that you could be a talentless loser like Cobain and get a reaction! This album and this music does not have a single redeeming quality I have never understood why people got into this crap there are no guitar solos(for those of you who listen to this stuff that is something played by talented musicians like Warren Dimartini and Geoerge Lynch),no hooks or melody to the songs and the vocals are absolutley terrible. For god sake don't buy this or anything like it,instead help all of us real rockers who like having a good time support hair metal! The only tragedy to Kurt Cobains death is that it didn't occur a few years earlier. By the way I gave this one star because Amazon said I had to rate it with at least a 1. If it was up to me I wouldn't rate it as high as a pile of petrified dog sh#t.
1	I also thought this might be the "next big thing" - seemed like cookie cutter top 40 stuff to me.  Not my cup of tea.
1	This CD of the Broadway revival of "Hair" is crisply recorded, energetically sung by an enthusiastic cast and smoothly supported by a first-rate band.  So why are the results so utterly abysmal?  Well, for starters, "Hair" has to have one of the worst, most amateurish scores ever written.  There are perhaps four or five memorable songs, but the rest is made up of scraps of things that rarely last beyond two minutes.  Vamps, chanted choruses and pastiche parodies don't add up to much.  And the lyrics are some of the clumsiest concoctions ever heard on Broadway.  "Singing...our space songs on a spider web...sitar...life flows around you and in you...answer for Timothy Leary...deary."  Huh?  Lyricists James Rado and Gerome Ragni must have been enjoying acid trip #364 when they came up with that lulu.  Throw in the knee jerk mockeries of the "Hail Mary" and the Constitution (shorthand at the time for showing you were "with it") and it becomes clear that these guys aren't songwriters; they're hacks.  The cast members try but the problem is, they try too hard.  The vocal mugging and gosh-darn earnest euphoria is so over-the-top they sound like they just came off the bus-and-truck tour of "Godspell".  Everyone has a terminal case of the cutes.  Even though they're singing about hashish, LSD, war and various sexual activities, they sound about as threatening and subversive as the Partridge Family.  Will Swenson as Berger is the chief offender.  His vocal affectations and attention-seeking swagger are relentlessly overbearing in a show-offy way.  After a while, I forgot he was supposed to be playing a hippy...I thought he was the reincarnation of Sammy Davis Jr.  Brutal.  Gavin Creel is less offensive as Claude, but his reedy, wan tenor is a slight instrument that never registers.  The only ones who come out unscathed are Sasha Allen, who does just fine with her stirring rendition of "Aquarius", and Cassie Levy, who brings a simple gracefulness to "Easy to Be Hard" and "Good Morning Starshine".  The energy-soaked "Hair" survives nearly unscathed as a hippy-dippy anthem.  Of course, it's hard to completely botch this song since it's such a euphoric upper, but Will Swenson's overkill almost succeeds in doing just that (can someone please make sure his Ritalin is replenished...SOON).  Unfortunately, the few glimmers of hope are surrounded by so much pushy theatricality that listening to this CD becomes an ordeal.  Somebody forgot to inform the singers that they don't need to hit the back row of the balcony on a cast recording.  Easy to be hard?  For this bunch, it's apparently "hard to be easy".
1	Mumford & Sons was unique. To turn their collective backs on their roots - for whatever creative reasons - severed their links b/w older fans and new (potential) fans. IMHO it was an egregious error. Never dump old for new; blend and recreate; take the best of each. Sadly, M&S is just another English rock band with little to make it unique - or GREAT. Sad.  Frankly, the banjo, bass fiddle & violin/horns made M&S a fusion of old/new, folk/rock; jazz/gospel - delightful. Frankly 'Believe' sucks...............  IMNSHO, as a PHD, US cultural historian, 'Believe' is boring with little to connect it to the joyous music of earlier music. I agree that repeating 'Babe'l would have been a cop-out. But to reinvent their sound without transition (or blending/creating/fusing) is too much of a leap............
1	There's better stuff out there.  Stick to "Sunland", "Latin Quarter", or "Mediterraneo" from Marc Antoine.  Jesse Cook's "Tempest" is another on of my faves.
1	This sounds like a band trying real hard to follow some thrash metal format suggested to them by their record company. There are a few songs on this album that are worth a listen (e.g. Iron Curtain), but overall it  lacks originality, a sound of its own.   If you like this kind of 80's,  very US/macho thrash metal, I would advise you to check out Nasty Savage,  Exodus (Bonded by Blood), Savage Grace or Hallow's Eve who were all far  better bands than this one.
1	Terrible so-called singing. Dylan never was much of a singer, but I didn't realize his voice was this bad. His fans, however, will lap this up like the hungry dogs they are. Some people are gluttons for punishment.
1	Bjorn Strid needs to stab himself in the face and the other band members need to jump off a cliff for allowing this atrocity to occur.  I was highly anticipating this album. I got Into Soilwork through Natural Born Chaos, an amazing melodic death album, and Figure Numer Five had some good moments. I went further back into their catalogue and got Predator's Portrait and Steelbath Suicide, and those albums blew me away. Complex riffing, ambient keyboards, crazy solos, and Bjorn's vocals were great.  Stabbing the Drama on the other hand basically spells the end of Soilwork as a Gothenburg band because this album is pure watered down Nu Metal garbage. It sounds like Dry Kill Logic with some synth in it.  Bjorn's voice has turned into an annoying tough guy growl, the riffs are so simple I can probably play most every song on this album and I've been a guitarist for only 4 months. No more mind blowing solos, harmonies and melodies, just the same muddy bar chord riffing in every goddamn song with what do you know a sing a long chorus to match.  While every American band is evolving and adapting the complex style that Soilwork helped pioneer they are devolving and taking up a sound that sounds like the last days of the Nu Metal explosion.  If this isn't bad enough, the new music video for the single off Stabbing the Drama shows only Bjorn with a beanie on walking around a junkyard. Not one other band member is shown AT ALL. Not even for a frame. The whole point of metal is to display the musicmanship of the band members, not glorify the lead singer. The band may as well be called Strid.  If you're a fan of bands like Dry Kill Logic, Nothingface, Slipknot, Fear Factory, and the like you may like this. But for those who are looking for complex metal or the Soilwork of old stay the hell away from this crap pile.  I'd recommend getting the new Dark Tranquillity over this. They unlike In Flames and Soilwork have not compromised their Gothenburg sound for commercial success.
1	This sucks.  I wanted the original The Kings "This Beat Goes On"/ "Switching to glide" as I've heard on the radio before. All I get is this live crap.  The studio version Amazon hacks into two separate songs.  This is unacceptable.  I want my money back.  Amazon needs to go read comments on "This Beat Goes On" or "Switching to glide" and see all of the unhappy people.
1	BB is only on one number. The others are recycled from previous Ellington band albums. Don't waste your money. Buy just the one song instead of the whole album.
1	Its not the latest songs. Its not the latest songs. Its not the latest songs. Its not the latest songs. Its not the latest songs. Its not the latest songs
1	Routine and uninspiring .'
1	another dime a dozen singers.  nothing to brag about with his music.
1	The instrumentals are terrific. However, I really bought this one for the lyrics, and they have been changed. The line saying, tha se nanourizo, me gliko skopo, has been taken out, and I don't like it. I'll just keep listening to it on youtube once in a while. It's just that I have such a great loudspeaker for my Kindle, and it is one of my favorites.
1	I hate it and the wife likes it, it's full of four letter words, it's hard rock sound is good but c'mon buckcherry you have got to clean it up. By the way they no longer use that name nor do I think they are still a band, this song is for the young teenager mind who's on a path to no where so if you can parents don't let this song or album get into your home. I'm just sayin!
1	I never received it.  something went wrong with how to download....and it erased all of my songs on my little ipod.
1	not at all what I expected.  didn't like at all
1	Product in poor condition. No booklet.
1	I wanted the complete concerto
1	Would have been 5 stars, if the album info were accurate.  75 songs? Yep. The song list on the back cover is accurate. Disc 1, track 1, Wake Up Lil Suzie? Yep. Disc 1, track 2, Bye Bye Love? Yep. Etc etc  But... as other reviews have said: the album has the wrong info encoded on the discs... the 1st song is labelled "Clarence", but it is Wake Up Lil Suzie. The  2nd song really is "Bye Bye Love", but it had some other label... etc etc etc... as I write this, I'm listening to Disc 1, track 7, which really is "(Til) I Kissed You", but the track label reads "Poor Jenny" , which is on Disc 3, track 4.  I'd go into more detail but I'm busy ripping the tracks to .MP3, then editing the properties manually.
1	Why is this song so popular? I have listened to it quite a few times and I just can't like it. It's not catchy and it is just not good.
1	Some of the tracks are great, but most are not. His skill is great and the general message is refreshing, but his completely uninspiring repetitions of phrases for a "hook" makes him sound like a 4 year old.  This is the problem with a lot of rap these days and why I give this young talent 2 stars.
1	First off, i'd like to say that i commend Jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound. It must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time, i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of "spirit" type folky songs. On the other hand, i don't really like this album. A few songs i do like and i do enjoy listening to, but i don't get far in when i have to skip tracks. "Stand" "Intuition" and "Haunted" are worth listening to, but the other songs are sub standard. They consist of poor lyrics, dodgy music and ridiculous spelling. "This Way" is by far Jewel's best album, i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route. I hope on the next album Jewel is back playing instruments, writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out. This album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from Jewel, something which is actually credible. Leave this to Britney, Mandy and Jessica. Oh and Jewel, keep your clothes on. Its not big, and its not clever! You don't need to sell your body to sell records.
1	I saw Joe on TV during a live performance and was blown away by the program.  This disc was disappointing.  It just seemed noisy and chaotic.  The sensitivity and beauty got lost.
1	The Album Has Alot Of Mistakes..iT Runs From One Track To The Other And u Feel The Empty Space In It..Not Cool At All. Hove Dj Blass Comes Up With Better Ideas Than This Mixtape.
1	I bought this for my dad for his birthday thinking it was a record bc of how it was described and it was a cd. Kinda bummed.
1	I am too old for this type of ghetto music. It may appeal to the younger more ignorant crowd.
1	While the songs are cute and my church children enjoyed singing them, it was a NIGHTMARE trying to get the split track accompaniment to work properly.  My church's worship program requires an MP3 to play the song.  You can't record a split track file into a split track MP3.  We are in the process of using recording equipment to record an actual accompaniment CD.  It's also a HUGE pain that each song is split into around 5-7 tracks each that don't always seemlessly go from one track to the other.  In a day and age when no one uses split track CDs anymore and everything is going to MP3, there should be an easier way to do things.  Don't purchase this unless you are satisfied with your kids singing to the prerecorded kid voices on the CD or you have an "old school boom box" to play it from.
1	Horrible, not funny at all!
1	All I can say is that this album is a hot mess. It's so all over the place that you can't even follow it. I love Zac Brown Band with a passion but for some reason he's out to prove that instead of being the best at something, he can be average in a bunch of things. He's an amazing and talented man but you should definitely pass on this CD.
1	As any Platonist on the turps will tell you: if it can be thought of, it must exist.  Accordingly somewhere in the universe, there must be a Planet Treble where bass is forever banished and shrillness is king.  This disc is a postcard from Planet Treble. Any number of shabby shockers were recorded at the start of the digital age and this is one of them. If this is what a string quintet sounds like in real life, well, I am happy to become Bobo's human-mattress in San Quentin.  The Smetana Quartet - as far as I can tell - play with their usual degree of artistry even if they do not eclipse the Belgian Gang in the slow introduction of K 593. Speaking of which, the whole point of this survey has been to measure the Smetata Quartet against the gold standard (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mozart-Complete-String-Quintets/dp/B000065TV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mozart: Complete String Quintets</a>). While Grumiaux won the first bout on points (K 515 & K 516) - here, it is a KO in the opening round.  Regrettably, don't bother with this disc. Even Fido the mutt, no stranger to high pitch, is wary of it.
1	Jenni Rivera was a great singer because she sang from her heart and put all her emotions to her songs.
1	So, tell me why I have to download the amazon app just to listen to the song that i purchased. Why cant it be directly placed into my phone's library? I don't understand. I cant even.
1	The music is beautiful, but you can't hear Susan sing.  I played the CD in 2 different CD players and I could not hear Susan sing.
1	30 sec could not tell me just how bad this was.
1	I wanted the original 'Battle of New Orleans' with "places a rabbit couldn't go," but I instead got a new version about Katrina: wasted money!
1	I have listened to this one several times and I just can't get into it... Sorry. Maybe it means that I'm not a "true" Type O fan... whatever that means. It just seems to me that this one is actually kind of "upbeat" and "catchy"... WTF? It doesn't seem to have that dreary, dark green, gloom around it that the other ones did. It somehow just doesn't seem be very genuine. Let's face it, October Rust, Bloody Kisses and most of the other stuff, struck some powerful chords. Dead Again just kind of wanders around through this Pseudo Beatles, pop, cheese thing... like they are trying way too hard to sell records.    I own everything from Type O & Carnivore and this one is my least favorite. Maybe it will grow on me but I doubt it. The first time I heard TON was well over 15 years ago and I just couldn't get into them back then. After I grew up, I listened to them again about 7 years ago and was able to relate to them. I had to go out and get everything they ever did and now I listen to them almost daily. Who knows, maybe when I'm an old man like Pete, I will find that this is the greatest thing ever recorded... I still doubt it though.    To anyone who hasn't heard this yet, I suggest that you check it out at the Library or at least listen to some samples before buying it. I don't care what anybody says, this one sounds much different than the Type O Negative that you are probably expecting. If you like happy pop music like Rush, Yes & the Beatles then you will probably love this, if you expect something a little more thoughtful, darker and more cynical... maybe not so much.    So does this mean that I think that TON is dead and washed up? No. I have faith that with the impending doom that the world faces today, Pete & Josh will be back on the Anti-Depressants & Booze in no time and will be back to their old selves again shortly. Just because Peter Steele is a filthy rich, 7 foot tall, ex-playgirl model, I know he really hurts on the inside...   So to any of you who take any kind of criticism of Type O Negative as a personal insult... I have two words for you.   "You Suck!" "You Suck!" "You Suck!" ;)
1	I loved Deep Purple and I think its great they are still making music together. I just can`t stand the guitar sound Steve Morse has. I love Ritchie Blackmore`s Fender Stratocaster sound. The MRK1 purple with Rod Evans and Nick Simper was also great. Steve pickup a Strat please! Great song material here and God bless those who love it. I can`t get past the guitar sound. Steve Morse is a great guitarist but he just doesn`t sound right for Deep Purple. The ghost of Ritchie Blackmore strikes again.
1	Most of the quality of the soundtrack is on the level of dreamy/reverberant synth/orchestral sound design and their intelligent blending. There are a lot of repeated synth-note pulses, emotion-laden chord sequences, broad hymn-lines with added noises from orchestral percussion/taiko drums, slow moving textures with occasional dramatic buildups.  However, compared to the rich quirkiness of the original TRON soundtrack, the musical substance of Daft Punk's production collapses to almost nothing, especially on repeated listenings.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Daft Punk as such and the comparison to Wendy Carlos is of course unfair, but after listening to this for a while, I realized that this soundtrack might in fact be a major reason for the lack of emotional connection I had to the film. Things oscillate between aggressive/menacing/overwhelming pulsation and tragic/melancholic darkness. The overall attitude of this soundtrack seems to be a "trancing out" of emotions. Instead of the perceptual shocks and high density of surprise elements that drove the original TRON over the brink of incoherence, we are now made to relax and accept everything as if in a subdued emptied state of hypnosis generated by repetitive patterns. The new movie felt like it wanted to tell a story of great depth, but in the end everything appeared strangely flat and permeated with things I seemed to have seen 1000 times before. I was wondering if an aspect of this experience was due to the fact that emotional or dynamic detail or cognitively uplifting accents are blanketed under the language of comparably glacial musical minimalism throughout this soundtrack.  Definitely not in the legacy of the original, but it's of course also a matter of taste. As a music lover, I could in any case not get myself as excited about it as many other reviewers on here.  The TRON adagio made me sigh.... "Oh Tron! Where did all your gladiatorial fruitiness go!" :)
1	Not the one I wanted. I didn't want the first track at all. The 2nd had the background live cricket sound too loud.  I finally found the original cd from Raven. (God's Cricket Chorus).  Order of magnitude better than this.
1	It is my favorite song but I had only listened to the radio version. Having the F word in it just takes away from my enjoyment, it doesnt add to it. I was disappointed to know it has that. Yes, I saw the word explicit. Yes, I realize it is in there but that doesnt change how I feel.
1	Thanks Kurt, for doing yourself in and sparing us from enduring album after album of this drivel. I guess all it takes to be a groundbreaking revolutionary band these days is to sing comotose behind a microphone, going off on rants about teen angst, rape and suicide. I guess you weren't completely worthless, if there was anybody who could take moaning, groaning and screaming to a new level, it was you. Somehow you managed to fool legion after legion of critics into thinking Nirvana was a sublime and trancendent experience, but I wasn't fooled in the least. Thank God the early 90s are over, the faster you fade away, the better.
1	Disappointed with the sound quality.  Very difficult to hear songs.  When you turn the volume up in order to hear, results in major distortion of sound quality.
1	This soundtrack was all in Spanish...I like 2 of the soundtracks only...what a disappointment.. Really hate this CD. I thought I'd hear more popular music from the movie.
1	Play through this once and you'll never play it again. Guaranteed. A waste of plastic and postage.
1	After the brilliant "Ghetto Love" and the terrific "Still Ghetto", could Jaheim be able to stay at that level? I was asking myself, every day while listening to "Let's talk about it". Then he released "Ghetto Classics", apparently to break his ghetto image... Too bad, the title is still ghetto but the songs too poor... And the last "The making of a Man". My grestest deception. I keep thinking that Jah is the next R. Kelly (without the sexual encounters...), but that album is so flat... Sorry Jah. What happened?? U're the best from now and the market is truly open. You're the one, do it better, more musical adventures, more soulful vocal... That's what your fans like me are expecting. I just move in the USA months ago, I'm not from here, but i love ur music...
1	I downloaded this as part of a free download, and I am definitely glad that I didn't pay for it.
1	This cd skipped tracks.
1	nothing
1	Got a vibe of the rationalization of the converted representation of rainbows. In the music video the Beastie Boys jump around in colored suits.
1	Really weak CD. Weezer has some great and not so great albums, but their reboots where they have a self-titled album tend to be their better ones. Not this time- as this is among their worst along with Raditude and Hurley. They have dropped the rock and power pop in favor of plain pop where the guitars are barely heard. Just a lousy set of songs with very odd lyrics. Very disappointing and I'm hoping they don't add many of the songs to their set on their summer tour, as there isn't a single one that stayed with me after five consecutive listens.
1	How come it won't download to my phone?
1	for whatever reason, they have edited, deleted, the last 30 seconds of the song!  I wanted the whole song, not just the first two verses
1	Wow...this must be their first CD even before America's Got Talent.  I am very musical and have to say that the harmony's were just off.  Did buy their most recent CD though and it was great.  Seems like they finally got their act together.  Sent this back as it was getting on my last nerve after the 3rd song.  Do not recommend.
1	Catchy tune, but why is it $9.99 on iTunes, and it's .99 here? Also, 10:35? Seriously? Are you just trying to clog up people's playlists? I can understand some crazy remix of a tune venturing into this time range, but this is the only version of this song in existence it seems. Oh, and nice album art. I think a little vomit made its way up into my throat.
1	I don't particularly hate it, I just don't care for it.  I got it at the suggestion of a friend but after listening to it, I definitely don't see how it will be classic since it sounds like everything else out there.  I gave it one star simply because it's "ok".
1	Tom Paxton's "Lyndon Johnson Told the Nation" is a great example of anti-Vietnam War music.  The download and transfer from Amazon.com to a PowerPoint for teaching purposes, however, is another story.  I teach a college course in US History, and I wanted my students to experience and discuss the anti-war music from the 60s.  When this download is transferred to a PowerPoint, it is totally garbbled.  Too bad.  Really could have used this.
1	Ok, what happened?? The Killers were slick, polished masters of their craft - one of the few bands to be excited about. Not anymore.  I see a lot of reviews talking about the Killers' "musical growth" on Sam's Town. DO NOT BELIEVE IT. Apparently '80s arena rock cliches equate to growth when people don't know any better. Most of the songs here showcase run-of-the-mill beats, stale guitar work, and cheesy driving basslines best left buried in the forgotten soundtracks of inspirational 80s afterschool specials. Throughout the album, Brandon Flowers' voice warbles atonally AND vibrates uncontrollably, doing things that no human ear should ever have to hear.  So how are the individual songs? When You Were Young and Bling are moderately listenable, but fail to rise to the level of memorable. The title track sounds good enough until a lumberjack choir and oompa band strike up near the end, ruining the festivities for everyone. Beyond these three songs, very little merits a positive mention.  The enterlude and exitlude provide hideously embarrassing bookends apparently written to make the library of bland tracks between them seem palatable. Unfortunately, the lumberjacks show up a few more times over the course of the album to ruin anything that starts to sound good. One song (i can't bring myself to listen again and find out the track name) actually ends with that tympani drum thing from 2001: a space odyssey. Trite musical garbage like this might spur a chuckle out of a live audience, but who wants to hear it over and over again when listening to the CD?  All in all, this butt-rockery sounds nothing like the Killers we all knew and loved. They've abandoned their unique blend of image and sound to try to be more serious artists. In the process they've lost what made them the great band they were. Sam's Town is a one-way time machine of bad creative decisions . I'm very sad and disappointed about this, and it actually makes Hot Fuss seem like a fluke that we'll never experience again.  Yes, the staff at their label are furiously writing 5 star reviews all over the net. But PR damage control won't save this black hole of musical nosedives.. Shameful.
1	Wouldn't download had to cancel amazon prime not worth it
1	Yuck
1	When it has came down to Usher, he has put out a lot of strong music when he was dealing with his heartbreaks like Confessions, and Raymond Vs. Raymond, but sadly there are a lot of songs that don't actually work for him very well. Good Kisser, the lead single from Usher's latest record just doesn't ignite. The song tries to being in a vibe similar to what Prince may have with his music, taking a step away from his influence, Michael Jackson. Sadly, the song for Usher is definitely not one of his high points in music, instead falls a bit from his grace. Hopefully, there will be better music from Usher down the road, because he needs better in his hearts right now. He has a lot going as a judge on The Voice, and for his tribute to Michael Jackson for his posthumous song Love Never Felt So Good, but either way he needs better for his voice, because this was the pits.  Song: D+
1	Not everything needs to be released!  This artist has an interesting and unique archival approach to releasing his recordings, apparently a compulsive need to release all of them.  Some tracks here such as: Lost Art, Ascension, and Contemplative Thoughts are listenable, but the others don't even qualify as outtakes.
1	Let me say first that I love Bruno's work and was so excited to get the new album. After listening to it all the way through, though...I really don't like it. It's a straight R&B album. That's fine if you like that genre, but I don't. I wouldn't have pre-ordered it if I had known. Seriously, how many times can he say "girl" and talk about booty? It's a lot of cheesy synthesizer and lyrics that sound like a teenager wrote them. I'm still going to see him on tour. I'm hoping the live arrangements are better than the album's and am looking forward to hearing his classic hits again.
1	terrible buy. O the verge of deceit.  The "tune' is not the original tune. Not even a reasonable cover! Just a lousy version played on cheap keyboards.  what a waste of time and money.
1	I ordered this to use in a small family video. I cannot insert into the video because I get an error message that it is the wrong format. HOWEVER - all of the other music that I use is the SAME format as this and I can easily use those recordings, so it has to be this product. I even ordered it twice, since I needed it immediately and thought maybe it was corrupted. No so. Same results with second recording. Disgusted.

1	I have to give this album 1-star. It's just sadly not good at all. I expected more from 'Poot Lovato'. If you're looking for a album that is a absolute MASTERPIECE, I recommend 'Revival' by Selena Gomez.
1	Walk Away Renee and Pretty Ballerina are their two memorable songs.  The rest of the album is, well, second tier.
1	this is just not the type of music i was looking for for Halloween at all super annoying and dumb
1	I rarely review anything, but this is playing on the radio and I can't believe how painful it is to listen to.  I agree with the previous reviewer - they have remurdered John Lennon!!!  Awful!  Awful! Awful! i don't even think they were on key.  Delete this from every playlist.
1	This album sounds more like the Risky Business soundtrack done by Tangerine Dream rather than a work done by Daft Punk.  Even though this is a movie soundtrack, I expected more energy from the Daft Punk duo.  I hope this is not the end of Daft Punk like when Toto did the Dune soundtrack.
1	I recall hearing this originally on  a real record long ago.  Totally cracked me up!.  But this is done poorly---it does not have the entire "contest".  Also, the the other comedy pieces are filthy and crude rather than funny.  Very disappointed in how this was put together.
1	The song is great but the digital download sounded horrible. In my opinion this recording was mastered very poorly and sounds distorted.
1	It's not that great of a dance tune. I don't get the hype on Garrix other than he's a young kid.
1	Pretty lightweight when compared to Alan Jackson's or Vince Gill's latest offerings
1	False advertising!  It said DVD-Audio, but it's just a regular CD.
1	What's with the cussing? Loose the foul language get five stars great message.
1	Fyi yo they Ghj fyi do
1	This recording could have been great....the balances are all over the place....the background vocals (which what they are supposed to be) are all way out in front. ....the orchestra sounds small and "tinny"....bad choices of what  and how to present this revival on disc. Bad choice of reverbs....The  spacing between songs is inconsistent. . Some songs start abruptly. Bad editing and inconsistently bad mixing. No direction was given to the stars.....both sound flat and "wooden". Not a theatrical presentation in the least.....vocals sometime sound like they're recorded in a closet. No dialouge?????No sense of the production....A VERY BAD CAST ALBUM PRODUCING  JOB.  period. The original Broadway cast recording as well as the London Cast recording are still the high standards for PROMISES PROMISES". This recording is a  good reason  why people don't  buy cast albums.....a missed opportunity.
1	There is no joy in this Ode To Joy.  The conductor left his/her joy at home.
1	Another year, another blockbuster with a basic licensed soundtrack. This movie is so bad we shouldn't be talking about Jared Leto's Joker outside of the cringe halls of fame.
1	Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience. It is highly recommended that one doesn't expose themselves to this music voluntarily though. To do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one's world view in small, and the world at large. Anyone who likes this doesn't like music, but I wouldn't know, I don't like music either-I like MOGWAI-Good boys from Glasgow Scotland that know how to rock. For "If it dunnae rock 'tis piss"
1	This album has a very fitting title. Mistake #1 was listening to this dreadful piece of s***. Mistake #2 is thinking this was a comedy album. I could not believe some of the stuff that came out of this man-childs mouth. I even think he stole a few passages from Mein Kamph. Joe 'Holocaust denier" Derosa is a terrible excuse for a human being and he is not funny.
1	Just use youtube or Spotify free.
1	I saw the 50/50 reviews for good/bad quality.  I bought it, had bad quality, and reported it to Amazon.  They checked the file, agreed with me and gave me a refund. Said they will fix the file soon.  Great Song, Great Customer Service by Amazon!  Just unfortunate re:quality
1	bought this because I heard a clip on Justified. Very disappointed. Not even a good bar band.
1	I would not recommend this CD.  I love their last album but this one is much to be desired.  Not great.
1	That's just my opinion. I like more melodic songs like this one not a lot of the stuff Radio stations play now.
1	So I thought I was going to hear the Enigma collection by Enigma but I was fooled....it was a remix and hated it.
1	Very poor quality. Both the cd and DVD are messed up.  The DVD skips and stops during play and the cd skips and sounds distorted. What a waste of money.
1	After his first solo album ... the superb " Stranger In This Town" ... I was firmly convinced that Sambora was the creatively superior one in the Bon Jovi / Sambora writing team ... now in 2012, I'm not so sure ...  Sambora's 2nd, and this, his 3rd solo record are quite forgettable ( as are all of Bon Jovi's albums since "Crush" , except for maybe "Lost Highway" )... in my opinion, that could be attributed to the idea that he has lost sight of the type of songs & sound that made his 1st solo record so good ...quality songwriting, catchy riffs, solid vocals & harmonies, and NOT over produced ...  One can only hope that at some point going forward Sambora recaptures the formula that he had when he did his best work ... but few artists ever do, because it is my feeling that an artist has only a certain number of good / great songs in them.  But I'll take mediocre Sambora music over just about anything else being released these days ...
1	Wasted a buck on another Amazon download that is not the version you hear on the radio. You want the one from the Love is Lost album. All the samples sound the same, but the recording are much different.
1	This song is terrible.  It's totally inappropriate and disgusting and the worst thing it doesn't even have a good beat.  What a waste.  Glad I got the download for free.
1	I received a discount on this product for my honest feedback.  Good item
1	I saw this band perform sound of silence on TV and was amazed, so I bought the album..  Ugghh.  Big mistake.  This group has nothing else to offer me at all.  Should have just bought the one song.  Yes, I realize everyone has there own taste in music but I can't comment on your taste, only my own, and for me, I'm not even remotely in the head banging stuff the rest of the album offers.
1	Well, I guess owning this one is better than no version of Sir Malcolm's 1954 version at all. But all is not lost! I have always felt that Sir Malcolm's 1954 version along with Sir Adrian Boult's 1945 version are the two best ever recorded (Just an opinion of an old fogy who lived through the 1950's). After all, both Sargent and Boult knew Holst personally. I have not heard any modern versions that musically capture that era like these two.  Both of these have been beautifully and painstakingly remastered by an English studio called Pristine Audio. The sound quality of the remastered classics is amazing. They can be found on the net.
1	Not very gd
1	It's live and hard to understand. It did not say that it was live!
1	First roar & now this stinking up the airwaves & its hitting up the charts? Will she ever go away? nice going people , You don't know what good music is anymore.
1	...turn off the wind machine and lose the echo effect and I'll PAY for this free offering. Honestly, this is lovely, often haunting music, ruined by too many audio effects.
1	I cant even be nice about how bad this album is. It gets one star only because you have to put something or this would get a big fat zero stars. Once again, another band taking almost 5 years to come out with the worst album of their career. Did they spend all their down time with Slayer and Dimmu Borgir??? I didn't realize that it took this many band members to come out with a piece of garbage like this. The last album was a serious let down, but it is great in comparison to this. Not only do the songs suck, but so does the production, mixing and mastering of this cd. The guitar fiffs are some of the most simple and lame I have ever heard from anything above a highschool band. Sometimes simple does the trick but not on this slab of trash. The guitars(are there really more than one on this album???) are in the wrong place in the mix and if you have any doubts listen their other albums and compare. I guaruntee you will hear what I am talking about. The mastering is even weak and it has a lack luster low volume final to it. Their is absolutely no sonic boom to this album at all. If this is what they expect their fans to like then they need to take off all the gimmickry and masks and try and be a real band. Image does not make great music. And neither do Mushroomhead anymore. I don't care for Slipnot but at least their last outing was decent--and listenable. I was lucky enough to have only wasted $8 for this at Target. Too bad their packaging of the album is so good because it is the only good about the entire effort. Too bad I can use it as toilet paper!!!
1	Now on the one hand, you can appreciate anyone's devotion to old school rock n roll...and make no mistake this is OLD school. You could have told me this was from 1971 and I'd have believed you.  The problem is, even within its' own context, this is a downright lazy effort. It sounds like the song lengths for each track are the same amount of time Ritchie spent writing them. All the riffs (and song titles for that matter) sounds like stuff you might on a non-album B-side from Lynyrd Skynrd or Ted Nugent. And the Bob Seger fetish is just getting sad at this point. You're from Detroit. We get it.  Old hippies and rock n roll heads might enjoy this, but there's not much here for anyone else.
1	I love this song, but it would not download on my computer. I got a corrupted file, and when I tried to download it again I got a notification on Amazon that the song was already downloaded.
1	Not what I thought but return process was great
1	Too much swearing
1	dunno how this Mary J. Blige cd sounds cause i never even purchased it? wtf!!!
1	No disrespect intended to this group, but I really did not enjoy listening to this song. It was free and I was trying to broaden my musical horizons. I did listen to it on three separate occasions, to give it a fair chance. This is just not my kind of music, but I am sure there are many folks out there that will enjoy it. I do wish the members of the group much lick and success.
1	Not only is the song horrible, I am extremely disappointed that Amazon would include this trash as part of a Christmas collection. Totally not in the spirit of Christmas.
1	I failed in error to play this song before I purchased it.  It is not the clean version and I would like a refund.
1	WE Never recieved this c.d. would love to know why..
1	The recording is really scratchy. I did not realize I was getting the original untouched?   I was trying to figure out how to get a refund but it was impossible to navigate the web site for a return on a download?  Maybe I can get a better version  downloaded.
1	Wait... What?... Fireflight was part of my childhood man. Their music has slowing gone down hill for me. However, this is a group of awesome people and I'm sure they will find a new audience. I just won't be part of it unfortunately.
1	Great song, but not a good recording of it...At around the 2:30 mark it starts to degrade also at the 4:40 mark... Most probably due to the source material, but if you're going to have me pay my hard earned dollars for a tune it should be perfect...
1	Love the song, but my copy cuts off before the song is over so I'm very disappointed.
1	An absolute con. There was nothing either rare or unreleased about the tracks on the CD. VERY disappointed.
1	Nah.
1	I'm not a fan of the 80's synthesizer sound. I really loved them too. Now they just sound like a generic pop band.
1	While there are plenty of "modern" Christmas songs I enjoy, THESE will NOT be among them.  Maybe I'm too old for this type of music but it was NOT appealing at all.
1	I love Willie Nelson, and all of his songs. With this album, for some reason, I can't get any volume. It just doesn't seem to want to volume up.
1	Poor musicianship, unimaginative writing, arrogant lyrics.  The fab four?  Hah!  More like the drab four!  Steer clear of this woeful, drug induced hippy garbage, and put on some banjo bluegrass instead.
1	Quality is terrible, bass is so distorted I can't stand to listen to it. I want a refund or better quality download.
1	I want to exchange the download of the song for the full and complete version. The download I purchased today cuts out before the end and jumps to the next song. What do I need to do?
1	Not sure why but I've bought every Down cd they've put out in the hopes that they would grow on me. That still hasn't happened. They come close but it's just not quite there. Love Pantera and COC but Down just doesn't do it for me.
1	I hate you i hate you i hate you. i had a credit and i tried to use it for two songs.  they got sent to 2 different folders.  now it says the download took too long.  and i lost my $ and the song.  YOu stink, Amazon.  make it easier to spend my own damn money.  thanks.
1	Not my thang!
1	This is was originally a bootleg from concert recordings in 1968 just before Uncle Meat was released.  Parts of this CD have been released on other bootlegs.  It is about 65 minutes long and the sound quality is OK.  It is a bootleg, not professional sounding, but in some ways is better than many live albums released today, like those by Dave Matthews.  This CD consists mostly of the same musical piece (I forget the name...maybe it is Uncle Meat)played at 3 different concerts in 3 different ways.  The pieces range from 14 to 17 minutes long.  The worst part of this CD is the horrible 6 minutes of Wild Man Fisher screaming his head off.  It is just painful to get through.  This is probablby a 3 to 4 star CD but I knock it down because of this Wild Man Fisher crap.
1	Idk why this is even exists???
1	Count Basic has a great live recording of this song and that is what I thought Amazon was selling but I downloaded this twice, paid twice, and both times got the studio version, not the live version.
1	These are not the Rippingtons that I know. This and their last CD Cote A'zur are/were very disappointing. Built To Last is a little better than Cote A'zur but that is not saying much. Thankfully I still have the Rippingtons music that I know & love to listen to (currently Indian Summer from Live in LA).
1	Advertisement at the end of selection. Refund processed promptly. Could not use song for purpose intended. Tried two different downloads and both were the same.
1	Saw her on TV, sounded OK, thought the CD would sound better.  Wrong.  The music is probably OK, but I haven't listened to it enough to know.  The sound quality is totally unacceptable.  It's hard to believe this is the sound the label was shooting for.  It can't be just a case of one incompetent dork in the studio, because at least a few people must have heard this before it was released.  Maybe I got a lemon somehow.  A guy I know told me that it might be a black market copy, but I bought it from Amazon, so that doesn't seem likely, and even an illegal copy should sound better than this.
1	We love Del McCrory but this CD left us cold.  It starts with a bang but out of the 14 songs we like about 4.  It's back to buying favorite songs one at a time through iTunes!
1	For fans of the australian punk-rock-a-billy band, "The Living End":  No, you didn't find some lost TLE EP.  This is not THAT "Living End".  In fact, this band is American and defunct, so PLEASE don't waste your money on this CD.  Buy some of Amazon's other quality TLE albums, singles, and imports.  The only thing I can't understand is why "Roll On" is listed here.
1	Picasso, when he became Picasso, never bothered painting Matisse paintings.  He knew that Matisse was the best one to paint in the Matisse style.  Dylan, being Dylan, is the best one to sing Dylan, to perform Dylan.  Let's leave it at that.  Too, nowhere has the Nobel Prize people shown such contempt for the USA than when it bestowed a Literary Award on Dylan, ignoring such literary luminaries as Roth, McCarthy, and DeLillo.  What a joke!!!!
1	double purchase
1	Wrong version
1	Barf. Boring elevator instrumental no lyrics album.
1	Such a letdown from her previous work. I love her so much and this was heartbreaking. All of the beautiful piano playing and quirky lyrics are missing from this album. Total sad face.
1	Its missing main songs. Im so upset I purchased this.. My fault, I should have looked at the playlist-- There is another Empire album that has ALL the songs.
1	The original "Knockin Boots" was a direct sample of Betty Wright's "Tonight is the Night".  This is not the same beat, it has no bassline or real rhythm.
1	This is not original cd . It is a cd-r and the cover has been made to look like original - it would not play in my sony sacd player es 9000 - a 1700.00 dollar player - detected it to be a cd-r . this should be better disclosed . It states this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/From-The-Sky-Deluxe-Version/dp/B002BH10Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">From The Sky (Deluxe Version)</a>under the editorial review .
1	Really stinks that Amazon does not provide a better vetting process before wasting money on songs that contain shout outs.  I bought this to play at parties and wanted the clean version, unfortunately this is the clean version but contains junk shout outs.  There's a clean version out there without the shout outs under Let's Go (edited album version) with a black album cover.  Thanks Amazon also for no return policy on MP3 purchases.
1	I agree with Phil. I have EVERYTHING Jack johnsons ever made. This is by far the worst. Wheres the laid back soul soothing tunes Jack? The band, drums, etc is just not you. Before all you defenders jump on the Jack band wagon and say "hes an artist expanding his talents" or something along those lines, I say I listen to Jack because jack at his best has no peers. this album is far from being peerless. This album seemed, rushed, boring, and way too poppy for Jack. This is a dissappointment for sure, good thing I got it on sale because the CD might just become a drink coaster. Guess I'll have to keep sitting, waiting, and wishing that Jack gets back to his roots and puts out a JACK JOHNSON style CD soon.
1	One star because its just the instrumental. No lyrics.  I haven't been able to find the one with the ladies' lovely voices. The instrumental is quite good though.
1	sucks
1	I am a big Rage fan, and wanted the edited versions to play while I drive a school bus. I paid $9 for all the 'clean' versions on Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I found they were NOT edited! I contacted Amazon and was given a refund, and told them about the error. Make sure you get what you pay for!!
1	I find the price for this CD too high, it should be in the range of $19.95 but not more than that, but the price you are asking is way over the real price of this CD. You should review this matter and put a price that is acceptable.
1	My son became terrified after listening to this cd.  I am not sure if the chimes in the background were new sounds.  Days later he is still affected--crying a lot and saying he never wants to do meditation again.  I am sad that I exposed him to it.
1	What happened to my favorite band. I love the way they made contemporary folk mainstream Sign No more and Babel are some of my favorite albums. This album is nothing like their previous albums, just a bunch of dime a dozen pop songs. Nothing unique or original here. Way to disappoint.
1	I never ordered this nor did I receive it. Don't know why you are sending me this for review. Not much more to say about it, woudn't order this.
1	the music all sounds alike and sounds like a repetition of the sleep soundly guitar disc. very disappointed as it is almost exactly what I already have and isn't that effective in either relaxation or sleep inducement. boring...the reviews were overhyped...
1	My favrit Josh Groban ever. I play it every few days. WIsh he would do more showtunes and less opera
1	This song was an anthem to all them cool ass white chicks in the early 2000s (in fact, it was played in the Wayans Brothers classic movie White Chicks. I originally gave it one star but bumped it up to two for comedic value. I picture a bunch of really white chicks snap dancing Carlton Banks style to this tune!
1	Cd i order came with a whole total differnt cd ..not very happy at all with this
1	Not good. Not good at all.. I love Danzig era Misfits AND I thought that Michele Graves era Misfits was great..Jerry Only as the singer isn't good. His voice is totally sub-par and the lyrics/songs are pretty weak. It's more of a 1 1/2 star record, more than a 2 star..Bring back Danzig permanantly!! Or bring him back for a full tour (Im happy that Danzig/Doyle/Only are playing the 2 Riot fest shows in September 2016) better than never having a true reunion!!
1	Mistakes Were Made: Funny jokes were not.  Even people who don't speak English hate this album. Pure s***.
1	these three girls have absolutely zero talent. they yell and talk their lyrics, which are filled with profanities, and their "music" has absolutely NO originality whatsoever. this is the worst music i've ever heard in my life.
1	Prince has always made great music.  When he is on he is on.  No one can touch him.  When he is off he releases this.. If you want old school prince funk get the Original 7's (the Time) last cd.  It was great.  This is funkless.
1	.  I,VE BEEN  A BARBRA FAN FOR DECADES BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED THIS TIME. I GAVE IT AWAY.
1	This song got real old real fast
1	What happened to these guys? I am a fan of the Crows, but after such a long time away I would have expected more. I did not write this review right away; I waited a while and went back over and over to listen to the album. I still cannot get into it and I really don't think there is anything memorable here.
1	I had purchased one of his songs for my cloud player and loved it.  But this one neither myself or my husband liked it. Someone else might like it fine.
1	I'm an exercise instructor and bought this to put on one of my mixes, because I like to put a variety of songs to hopefully please most of the class members. It was so awful (I hadn't really heard before) I had to skip it on my mix.
1	Ordered by mistake!!
1	annoying voice, especially when she tried to chant- nails on a chalkboard. Screetchy,unpleasant. Not worth it ,even if it were free. So many others to pick from that are beautiful-don't settle.
1	Nickelback's The Long Road, the follow up to their previous hit album Silver Side Up, sounds as if it came to soon. The Long Road does have its highlights with the radio staples "Someday" and the raunchy Figured YOu Out,but when it comes to the rest of the album there's nothing there. Most of The Long Road sounds like their using the same song over and over, most of the performances are unispired and dual. A major disappointment when compared to Silver Side Up.
1	The value here is historical and at $22 this is very, very expensive for obviously an amateur recording pirated during his last performance. Compared to the Concertgebouw DVD of these symphonies and the superb Orpheo recordings of the 6 th and 7 th symphonies, this release doesn't bring much more. Avoid.
1	Yes kurt did ruin rock music and he was the one responsible for every terrible rock genre you seen on the radio (Nu Metal, Emo, Pop Punk, New Alternative) although Nirvana did change the face of music, they also destroyed, now it's nothing more than a whining hyena thanks to this band, I Blame nirvana for every single thing that's wrong with rock from the 1990's to present, from this release to nu metal, pop punk, emo and other trendy crap (while good grunge bands like pearl jam & alice in chains get pushed aside)and then finally the worst thing to ever happen to modern rock St. Anger, The Greatest Metal Band ever made Metallica died in a very shameful and horrible death in the worse way's possible (Nu Metal), Smells like teen spirit was pathetic and about a girl was the only good song on the album  The Musicians are terrible (with the exception of Dave Grohl who moved on to better and way better things) and what makes me even sicker than rolling stone magazine put kurt over eddie van halen, Carlos santana, randy rhodes as the best guitarist of all time.  Nirvana really ruined rock and roll and paved the way for terribleness for the next 15 years and for that I Will never forgive them.
1	what happened to all the cool rappers from back in the day? now all of these rappers sound exactly the same....
1	Could not fine it on my computer not sure what happen. I wanted to burn on to a cd I needed it for a gig I was playing at. Had to have a friend get it for me. I have no luck with download songs from Amazon. Not sure why
1	Very small
1	So far, I have loved every single song pre-released from the new upcoming album but then this one squeezed its way in there.  It reminds me of Lady Gaga and less of In this Moment.
1	It was ok but not tge best
1	Disc 2 is worthless... the only way you can listen to the audio tracks on disc 2 is to play in your computer.  WTF?
1	Bad
1	The rate I have given has nothing to do with the song! It has to do with Amazon downloads!!! I have had mostly nothing but trouble when I download songs. Using several different computers...they time out and then say you have downloaded or for instance today they said it would take over 3 hours to download one three min. song - when I went to look at my account to see the status it said I downloaded it - which I did not...lost money on the downloads three times now and can't seem to find a place where I can get a refund!
1	Taylor Swift, to paraphrase Simon Cowell on William Hung, can't sing. She "talks" her way though in a monotone style with lyrics that sound like they should be in a high school soap opera. Red is no exception and, quite frankly, I am amazed at how long this "gig" has lasted. What I object to most--and she's not the only one--is the commercialization of country music by fluff artist who are not singing country music , but are perverting the genre. I mean, can you imagine George Jones or Merle Haggard singing with this gal? Taylor Swift needs to get the heck out of country and go with Britney and all the other bubble gum artists and, then, hopefully fade away like, to name a couple Debbie Gibson and Tiffany. Avoid this album and, for that matter Ms. Swift's "music" like the plague. When we lose Merle, George and rest, whose gonna fill their shoes?
1	Poor musicality. Low quality lyrics. Trashy video.
1	Have not seen the show, but it just does not want to make me listen to it over and over and over again.  Heard it about 5 times and gave up
1	I just finished downloading (from the cloud) and there's a problem.  Four of the tracks will not play on Windows Media Player or on Winamp (on a Windows XP system). The bad tracks are:  (disc 1) track 04  (disc 1) track 08  (disc 2) track 10  (disc 2) track 13 If I try to open them in Windows Media Player, nothing happens; the name doesn't even appear in the playlist. If I try to open them in Winamp, then (disc 1) track 01 (Canon) plays instead!  I believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long.  Windows won't even let you rename them in the normal way.  UPDATE: I've found a workaround to the file problem, which is listed at the end of this review.*  ALSO:  Several of the tracks are NOT relaxing, IMHO.  For example, disc 1 track 9 (Violin Sonata) has several passages that become quite loud and full of angst...  not relaxing to me.  Disc 2 track 4 (Ballade No. 1) has several sections that are quite loud and heavy-handed, and a section near the end that is quite agitated.  Disc 2 track 10 (Sonata for Two Pianos) begins quietly, but has several passages that become quite loud and aggressive.  Disc 2 track 16 (Minuet in G) has a few sections that are downright bombastic, with the piano hammering out the bass line in octaves while the orchestra plays fortissimo.  Indeed, classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific.  But the selection on this pair of MP3 "discs" seems to be quite erratic.  To point out just one glaring example:  where is Brahms' Lullabye?  Buy this as a general sampler, if you like.  But do NOT expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it's finished.  * FILE REPAIR SOLUTION  As I suspected, the problem is the excessive length of the file name and "path" (the entire route that the computer takes to get to the files).  Windows allows a maximum of 255 characters for the path + name.  By default, when you download these, Amazon will put them in this path: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Amazon\Various Artists\A Collection of the Most Relaxing Classical Music in the Universe\ That's 135 characters right there, which leaves 120 characters for the track name.  Now let's consider the name of one of the non-functional files: (disc 2) 10 - Sonata for Two Pianos in F minor, Op. 34b_ II. Andante, _un poco adagio_ - Sonata for Two Pianos in F minor, Op. 34b_ II. Andante, _un poco adagio_.mp3 That's 165 characters.  So the total is 135 + 165 = 300 characters, well over the 255-character limit.  Windows just can't handle that!  As a workaround, after you have downloaded all the files, navigate to the folder as listed above.  Temporarily rename the folder something very short, like "XYZ" (without the quotation marks).  That's 65 characters shorter than the original file name.  Now the totals are under 255 characters, so Windows will let you rename the individual files.  Go through and chop out all the duplicate information.  In the example given above, you'll cut out 72 characters, leaving a total of 93 characters.  Do this for all the tracks.  Finally, if you want, you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable, like "Relaxing Classical Music" which will give you a total length of 94 characters.  If you add the new file name (from the example above) which is 93 characters, you'll see that you end up with a total of 187 characters, well UNDER the 255 character limit.  Of course one wonders:  Why didn't Amazon think about this, and use a reasonable album name, and file names WITHOUT duplication, in the first place.  MY CONCLUSION:  Given that at least four of the tracks are NOT relaxing, and you'll have to spend at least 15 minutes screwing around to fix the file naming errors, IMHO this collection just isn't worth the trouble, even if it's free to begin with.  Of course if you're really hard up for music that is MAYBE relaxing... go for it.  Personally, I think Amazon could and should do a better job.  I know I would, if I worked for them.
1	sounds like it was recorded on a $10 tape player in a garage.  shame on the producers for even selling this junk
1	i bought this cd hoping this would be the greatest rap album ever! but after I listened to it I was totally wrong. This is the worst rap album ever. 50 cent doesnt compare to LL cool j. He is still the greatest rapper ever!
1	i don't listen to music because music sucks to be. it is terrible to listen to. it sucks really bad.
1	50 cent debut could have been better with his lyrical content. all the songs sound the same. the beats are the star on this album but for fifty himself in my eyes he falls short of being a great rapper like nas tupac or jay-z. and i believe this album was hyped up more by 50's personal life more than his rapping
1	The CD arrived and it is not working (broken record).
1	I am not surprised that another one of these pop-punk bands made a CD that the only people who want to listen to this is a poser.
1	There are at most 3 songs worth listening to. After the first few songs, it really goes downhill. There is no consistency or feel to the whole of the album. I wish I would have just purchased the handful of songs and left the filler.
1	If ever there was a cd that needed to be remastered/remixed, this is it.  And let me say I really like Best Coast so I'm not just bashing them.  The audio mix is literally the worst I've ever heard on a factory produced cd and if I could give it less than 1 star I would have.  The vocals are so low, distant and muted it is crazy.  Then you find yourself turning up the volume to try to hear the singer and now the guitar is too loud.  As for the positives, there are some cool songs on this album but it's a shame the mix ruins it.  I bought Best Coasts "The only place" cd first and it was great so this one is a bit of a letdown.  I guess nobody bats 1000, right?
1	DIABEETUS
1	I love Eddie Hazel's guitar playing, I LOVE HIS GUITAR PLAYING! Unfortunately this CD is just plain bad, and worse... ...it is boring.  It consists of a some very poor qualioty home recording and a few one chord jams where Hazel is barly audible.  I LOVE EDDIE HAZEL's PLAYING, but this is pure junk.
1	There is no question about why Kelly Clarkson hasn't really been able to shine in her songs lately. They all have felt exactly the same on top of each other. She hasn't been able to get herself seperated from her American Idol image very well. Her latest single doesn't seem to really shine that brightly to my ears. I Do Not Hook Up, the second single from her 4th album All I Ever Wanted feels like it is just one in the same from her pervious earlier songs. It really isn't a great song after a few times, and feels like it has lost its luster very quickly. I overall wasn't very impressed with all the tracks from All I Ever Wanted, and for Kelly, she needs to find something different to seperate herself from the same angry-driven songs she has created for awhile. She doesn't really hook up at all.  Song: D
1	I bought this mps to put into a photo story slide show.  Although it played on my computer, Photo Story for Windows did not recognize it as an audio file.  This was the only thing I needed the file for, so I just wasted the $1.29 on this order as it DID NOT serve my purpose.
1	Everyone all these reviews are for a band called Dorothy that I just saw at Rock fest with a smoking hot singer. This cd is not that bad I bought it cause the pic show her n talk bout her song after midnight but this disk is a band of five guys very upset. Go to iTunes she has a ep with the right songs. I am pissed people led me to believe it's was her band they are killer.
1	Lifelong fan for over 40 years (every album, most movies, 2 concerts)  but folks,  this isn't the best she's sounded in a long while-  Barbra fan's just can't admit it. Lackluster dated arrangements - Babyface? - no excitement whatsoever.  Although, there was a bit of a spark with Lionel- but the rest? Of all the male singers out there....For pete's sake, look at some of the videos- she couldn't even be bothered to leave her house to record the duets! (at least pretend to be in the same room)  and that album cover?  Never thought I'd see it. The songs,  we've heard them for years. Why mess with perfection- do something new. Please.  She doesn't need the money- maybe it was someone's idea to 'stay relevant' Someone please say no to her and maybe, just maybe - she might make an interesting album again. It's been a long time..... and Gypsy ... seems everyone knows it's a bad idea but her.  I miss 70's Barbra.  Guess I'll keep Superman, Butterfly and Stoney End in the que.
1	This lady is no Shania Twain.  The fake southern accent is embarrassing.  Her voice is okay - not professional material, but okay nonetheless.  But she is NOT from the South - please, lady, give up the fake southern accent.  This is someone who would do better at pop (gag).  My friend burned this CD for me because she likes Yvette's husband's band (the Nelson Brothers).  Well, save your money, people.  Wait until she comes out with a pop music Cd.  Or better yet, get a CD by a REAL country music singer.
1	It was not too good for me but may be different for others since I am picky on sound effects I get. LOL
1	Get the bonus CD which actually has the songs you all want to hear like Drip Drop and Keep Your Money.
1	its OK. Some of the songs are pretty good but to be honest it does not compare to Babel which rightfully won album of the year when it came out... Funny i rarely watch the grammys because the music i like never wins. and it won that year.  We loved Mumford and sons for their great songs but their folsky feel was what made most of us fall in love with them in the first place.  This is a trend ive seen in artists ive liked for years now.  They start off low key and in my view very well keeping it simple but providing good songs but then they get bigger and likely some big shot manager says "Gee guys you want to stay on top you gotta keep up with the times"  So this album is likely the product of some big shot record producer or label saying Hey why not do a rock album  its a sell out. Im sorry.  This is not what we grew to love.  It really to me is a bit betraying when an artist who has the style of music you like decides to completely change that.  If you wanted to do something like this great. but why not had a double album or something where you could have both sides rock and then your traditional style.  i think the folk/rock style was great because it was unique in todays modern music when everyones brother tries to sound exactly the same as everyone else Thats the problem with the music industry today..  Its not about being unique its about hey you gotta make something that sounds like all the other crap out there.  I like some of the songs the Wolf is pretty good but still....  Just feels like a sell out to me.
1	Only OK
1	The record took a long time to ship. It was intact and good quality but there was no record jacket. I was very disappointed when I opened the package. I purchased Wednesday Morning, 3am on amazon because I hadn't yet stumbled across it in a thrift store, but it cost more than it should have, especially considering that it didn't come with a record jacket.
1	I tried to like this album but it seems contrived and forced.  It doesn't really flow smoothly and seems more on the lines of a heavy metal band than a hard core original rock band.  I like just about every song they have done up to this point.  Not to say there isn't a couple songs I can listen to but as a whole album I can't sit through it.  The last two I played over and over for hours and not got tired of, well eventually I had to give them a break but they are worth listening to, not so much this one.
1	Like most people I loved this song's beat and had planned to add it to my 'summer soundtrack." Fortunately I looked up the lyrics (right around the time of the Ohio school shooting) and just felt a sick feeling that wouldn't go away. (I had to watch multiple episodes of Colbert to feel a little better then listened to some Feist to get rid of the feeling...) Once you know what you're humming along to, you'll probably hate the song too. I'm deleting the song along with the rest of their album. I'll look for another cool sounding band whose lyrics don't promote the devaluing of life.
1	Music and singing voice gave me a headache.  Why must there be so much noise!!!  UGH!  Not for me.  Hope someone else likes it.
1	I'd stick to 'Airwaves' not this vocal version.  The non-vocal version is much better!  One of my favorite tracks without the cheesy lyrics.
1	Sorry I really like this group they lots of other great song but they butchered a classic with this cover
1	It has the wrong name on the song, it is not The Bear Went Over the Mountain, It is about touching your fingers to your nose and toes.
1	excellent
1	not my style
1	love this recording however the file plays a such a low  volume its unlistenable no matter how much you turn it up. very disappointing, there is no way of knowing when you by it
1	I grew up listening to hip hop, and still listen to hip hop. I have always loved Dr. Dre and his previous two albums are classics, but this album is an embarrassment. It hurt me to listen to it. The beats are terrible, the lyrics are weak, and you can't even recognize Dre's voice. He should have quit while he was ahead.
1	Rick James would say,"cocaine is a hell of a drug!"  And this reminds me, don't do crack kids.  It is an insult to anybody with ears.  Horrible.
1	Joe DeRosa isn't technically a bad comedian. I have a hard time enjoying this material because about a year ago he invited me up to a hotel room and blocked off the door while he masturbated, moaning the lyrics to "Walk Like an Egyptian." Then he told me "When people ask who did this, you say Louis CK did this" before stumbling out. I think he was drunk. Not my favorite comedian.
1	This cd is not really what it says it is. "Piano Reflections" sounds like a gentle, relaxed kind of collection, but "Theme From Hill Street Blues" by Mike Post and "Funeral March" by Patrick Cassidy are certainly not that.  Whatever caused this compilation to exist was not a musical theme, but is more likely related to licensing costs and commitments. There are a couple of nice tracks here, but they can be found on other better compilations.
1	I have played this "music" once, and now will give it to the first person who likes that sort of noise. Was disappointed, because I liked the movie very much. Just didn't pay enough attention to the music while watching it.
1	The first song was ok so I thought we 'd try it. The rest suck. Even though it is free, my 6 year old doesn't like it.
1	disappointed
1	Terrible.  Couldn't listen even for 20 minutes.
1	My dad had this on cassette tape. He wore it out torturing us as small children. Bought him the cd AFTER I moved out of the house.
1	Not what I expected
1	Even Sir Mix-A-Lot wouldn't touch that "bass"
1	Twilight Time recorded by the original Platters in 1958 is one of the beautiful songs ever written or performed. When I clicked the Amazon link under a YouTube video http://youtu.be/LDumk3tQxuI to purchase the original Platters singing Twilight Time, I was shocked to receive this version. After trying without success to make Amazon understand their link under the YouTube video goes to the wrong song, I purchased the song from another website. Five thumbs-down to this song . . . and Amazon.
1	Does this guy know how to talk about anything other money and smokin? WOW and this guy is rich huh. Anyways I only bought 2 songs, Work Hard Play Hard, I love the beat and Remember Me, this song actually would have been better off without him, his part pretty much has nothing to do with the song and guess what, he talks about money and smokin again. I work so hard for my money and live pay check to pay check but people like him are rich, it really bugs me sometimes. I am glad I did not buy the whole album, I was excited for Rolling Papers because I loved Black and Yellow and that album was complete trash and from what Ive heard off this new album its pretty much the same other then the 2 songs I like.
1	I downloaded this because i wanted this song on a mix cd. i skip this track every time, it is so horrible. sounds cheaply produced.
1	Notwhat I expected
1	Not as good as I remembered.
1	not what i expected at all don't bother they have nothing interesting to say save for one song and i can't even remember it
1	Too sad.  Must be a liberal
1	Hawaiian music, it ain't.  The steel guitar is completely synthesized, and it sounds like something you would hear at a creepy carnival.  On top of that, there are clarinets and other woodwind instruments present that destroy any sense of Hawaii and deposit you at brunch with all the fixin's at Billy Bob's Blackjack Boom Town.  AWFUL.
1	Chill track, but it rings hollow when sequenced immediately after NO. You don't "deserve" anything from anyone, especially not when you're actively repelling everyone. Ms. Trainor's creating a recipe for dying old, bitter, and alone and you, dear listener, deserve better.
1	X Rated!  Watch out.  I downloaded this while preparing a DVD for my husband's funeral.  I used this as one of the songs in the background of a slideshow of pictures of his life.  After hours of putting it together and making copies for his mother, brothers, and sons, I finally sat down and watched the whole video.  I was SHOCKED to hear an x-rated word in the very beginning of the recording.  Apparently the artist stumbles a couple of times with the music and then mumbles the F-word in exasperation.  The video was wonderful (except for the flub) and there was no time to redo it, so I gave out the copies with a warning.  It also played continuously as a loop at the funeral home during visitation.  No one else picked up on it, or if they did, no one mentioned it.  I just wanted to make others aware of this.  Had I known, I would have, of course, downloaded a different version of the song.
1	Thin voice with rushed diphthongs.
1	cd quality terrible,would not play on functioning cd player that plays other discs
1	Only one song on the CD is worthwhile. This not worth buying and I was very disappointed. Ave your money.
1	Harsh lyrics for a harsh life portraying...not typical of upbeat Legend music. Wish I had selected a different album...good concepts and music abilities but not one I care to really listen to again and again.
1	Very poor sound quality: it sounds as if it came from MP3s.  Plus a few clicks at track starts.  I returned it.
1	I have been a big fan of Rick Springfield for a long long time and its sad to see the one time rocker releasing a CD like this.  The covers are boring to listen too although I do lile the cover of Broken Wings but even that track cant save this CD. The choice of songs are also very poor and most just don't suit Rick's voice, Sad Sad Sad.
1	I gotta bust out some truth here. Ready to cry, Megadeth fans? "Hardwired to Self Destruct" is way better than this album. Sure, "Hardwired.." drags in a few places, but the highlights for that album were really great--a true return to form for the Four Horsemen. "Dystopia" is just a snoozefest. There's no hook here. Even "Death Magnetic" surprised me more than this album. Even Danzig's "Black Laden Crown" surprised me more than this album.  Megadeth fans always brag about Mustaine being a better riff writer and more talented guitarist than James Hetfield, but it REALLY doesn't show on this album. Not one bit. I think maybe Marty Friedman and Chris Poland deserve a little more credit for some of those classic Megadeth songs of yore. I think "The System Has Failed" is probably the last Megadeth album I liked to listen to over and over again.  Oh well, at least it's not "Repentless," I guess. Yeah, that's about all I can say...
1	File folder is corrupt - can't remove from my PC no matter what I do.  The mp3s themselves are fine.  Nothing spectacular, about what you'd expect.  But the folder ....
1	not deluxe---each singer is much better on her own---was so excited originally that when amazon told me I had it on cloud I listened to it---sent back the DVD unopened---but they want me to pay for it because I checked it out
1	There is something wrong with this song don't buy it!!! it skips slows down just not right...not what I wanted not what I thought
1	Every song I try to stream fails and tells me to try later SO GLAD I pay for a Prime Membership I get to partially enjoy
1	It's not as if there were extended instrumental solos. This extended version just had a lot more moaning and groaning and the intro had a lot more empty space.  Cheap, but ultimately not recommended.
1	Unfortunately, after the release of the so-so ep Like A Stranger last year, I feared that Kitten were going in the wrong direction. The long-awaited full length album confirms I was spot on. What a pile of crap this album turned out to be in the most predictable way! I feared Chloe was moving away from the New Wave leanings and going towards the unnecessary direction of old Madonna records. Just listen to garbage like Sex Drive, Why I Wait and Devotion to hear the horror. Tossing in some tracks from the Like A Stranger ep and the reworkings of other old songs doesnt save this at all. Kitten had great potential but their five minutes is up. All the zombie drones worshipping this nightmare haven't a clue where Kitten had been, and it was a much better place. The band is touring now and are in my area in a couple of days. I was saving my ticket purchase until I got to sample this album in its entirety, hoping for the best. Since all my fears were realized on this abomination, I will not be wasting my money to see Kitten in concert hoping to see and hear some remnants of their former and now dead glories. There is clearly no point in following this band any further. NEXT!!
1	Accidentally bought this version while looking for the Idina Menzel version.
1	I hate when I am in the mood for songs and you immediately go to the web and download.  This album is one that you will, if you like the original radio version of Foreigner, hate.  It is obviously not the original radio versions and you can tell immediately from the first song.  Personally, once bitten...
1	This CD seems more like a "product" than an artistic effort.  Can't anyone write decent songs anymore?  The concept of a melody seems to be lost, which is a shame for someone like Joss Stone, who does have vocal chops.  There are a few efforts to throw in some "exotic" instrumental sounds but the album is basically the same reggae style that is okay as background music but not distinctive enough to stand up to repeated listenings.
1	I just wanted to download the song onto my computer to use. I was being forced to jump through all kinds of hoops. Forget it! I will never buy music from amazon again. It was a total waste of time, money & frustration.
1	too sad
1	I have never had this kind of feeling after listening to a song or an album. I absolutely love the songs in this album, but the sound quality is just really awful for a few (especially the Radioactive song). Dont get me wrong ... I am not trying to listen to this on my PC speakers. I have a pretty decent set of stereo speakers with subwoofer that I use ONLY for music (and no, they are not your run of the mill 5.1 speaker systems). So, I can safely say that the problem is with the recording quality. Whether the bad quality is intentional (I would doubt why on earth) or accidental I don't know, but that has simply spoiled the audio experience for some of the songs. So, a 5 star for the music, lyrics, tune, voice, etc. And 1 star for the sound quality. But since the horrible sound quality completely spoils everything, I cant but give this album any more than a 2 star rating.
1	Couldnt download it. Try and tried. Gave up. Could get help
1	Not at all my type of music, so take my review from that Perspective. I do the occasional DJ party , and needed ( tripe like this to suit the younger crowd. Normally I wouldn't DARE, waste my money on this Juvenile, Pop, Garbage. But There MANY out there that Like it.
1	Shame on Amazon for carrying this CRAP....  we will not be renewing our prime account
1	Not good and I'm a big fan of DM
1	Not very effective
1	1. Snow is My Downfall 2. Tennessee Waltz 3. Someone I Love  One of these songs had a kazoo solo... a joke right? NOPE.  The song was pretty good up to that point.  I think the Tennesse Waltz was pretty good.  The title song... strange.  I love Patti Rothberg but this was not one of her best.  I felt like she was playing a joke, which would be like Patti to do.
1	I only like one song on it. I usually really like her songs so this was dissapointing
1	I like the more traditional versions of songs. This was too slow and different for my liking. Others might like it though. Everyone has different taste in music.
1	I'm a huge Adam Duritz/Counting Crows fan, so periodically I check to see if he/they have anything new out. When I entered Adam's name, this CD came up, so I bought it. But guess what? No Adam. Not anywhere I can find. It's folky/country and for the most part I can't stand it.  So, if you're an Adam Duritz fan, don't let that be the reason you buy this CD. You'll be greatly disappointed if you do.
1	I love the song but didn't realize that it wouldnt be downloaded to my phone. I already have google play and thats where all of my downloaded music goes unless I get it here evidently
1	Not the version I was looking for...it was just guitars no singing...still love Lynard though...
1	It doesn't play past a certain point and it keeps starting over. Waste of money.
1	The preview of the song didn't represent the type of music accurately.
1	Don't like it!
1	One star because I could not download it as a ringtone. Disappointed that Amazon disallows downloads outside of its application.
1	I wouldn't consider myself a fan of Trivium, but I have been following the metal scene for quite a while.  Trivium has chosen a new direction with this album. Their touring connection to Metallica and Iron Maiden (see the album's liner notes) has probably played a major role in their pursuit of a similar sound. I speculate that Roadrunner Records also put pressure on this group to create a more mainstream album. The label has been dropping its heavier acts and signing bands like Megadeth that do not fit with their previous brand image.  This album is a disappointment to old fans, especially my friend Peter. If it were released at a different time, I would not have the option of saying, "These guys are trying to sound like Avenged Sevenfold". Unfortunately, I just did.
1	did not order this
1	This isn't the version I was looking for and probably not the one anyone else is looking for either. This one isn't bad though.
1	Background music is very nice, but the loud dripping water is irritating.
1	Not the explicit version. If I could rate it lower I would.  Sound quality is fine, but it isn't what it's advertised. Give me back my $!
1	Gospel music with no soul.
1	Won't play in US, wrong format. Thanks.
1	I've been a Ray Stevens fan since 1970 but this is not what I remember. Re-recordings of his classics along with his barely funny newer material in no kind of order. No booklet either (that little piece of paper would reduce profits).  I guess if you're a casual fan, or someone that will go to see anyone that's playing in Branson, you might like it more than I did.
1	case was cracked upon arrival
1	Great band. Low sound quality cd. If you ever have a chance to see them live, don't miss it!
1	Not what I thought it would be. One or two good tracts the rest just okay.  A bit dissapointing.  Oh well.
1	It is not clean.
1	Loudness war much?  This thing is crazy loud! You don't need to compress the audio so much to make it sound loud -- just turn the volume up!
1	When I downloaded this it only did the last three songs. I haven't figured out why yet, and I haven't had a chance to ask amazon what might be the problem. I expect problem free delivery every time from amazon and I'm not happy I have to take the time to deal with this!!!!!
1	Sound quality on this one is the pitts. Find a better recording.
1	Not what I expected. I was so upset that I even purchase this. Did not keep me interested. I tried to keep an open mind.
1	Audio is terrible
1	I was not happy with the amazon cloud player it did not download properly into it. I have it on my Ipad. It doesn't play!
1	I selected ambient music to fall asleep in an unfamiliar hotel. It was great, but several times I was abruptly awoken by a sudden change in music. It was not relaxing at all and sounded like upbeat noise. I had to restart the app and select the quiet stuff again. Eventually I just shut it down completely.
1	The song is what I wanted and expected. The two stars refer to the experience of trying to get an MP3 without installing crap on your computer to get it
1	Kinda upset I bought the whole album, but when I went to play it back, it was missing the title cut and tracks 1, 2, and 3...What's up with that?
1	I like  my Baroque light, clear and transparent. To my ear this rendition of Vivaldi was heavy, thick and opaque. The soloists, especially, seemed to think they were singing Wagner at his most tempestuous. If Dominus wants me to understand what He is saying, He will have to deliver it via the Academy of St Martin in the Fields or the Tallis Scholars. They are worth listening to.
1	Awful message, offensive song, divisive, intolerant.  In a word, all the things she would call those with a different point of view.  Glad I heard this before I picked up the album. One fan down...in search of more introspective and enlightened voices.
1	This is the worst CD that I have ever purchased.  My wife and I have decided that if we have guests over for dinner that we should play this CD when we want our guests to leave. I'm sure there would be a stampede for the exit door. I wish I could return it to Amazon and get a full refund!
1	Sara Groves is a great singer-songwriter, and has written some absolutely fabulous songs.  Unfortunately, this CD misses the mark, and is by far the weakest of her releases.  The CD is lacking the lyrical and melodic depth of her better songs, and, as noted in other reviews, has a mass-produced CCM sound that does not serve her well.  For Sara's best, check out "Other Side of Something", "Conversations", and her most recent release, "Fireflies and Songs".  Each of these CD's include songs that are as good as any music produced in the last 10 years.  Nobody's perfect . . .
1	These are a fake group ... Mary Wilson and Motown will stop you in the name of respect
1	I bought this music today.  Instead of saving it right away, I opened it to listen.  As a result, I wasn't able to save and find this file anymore in my computer.  So I paid $0.99 to listen a music only once?  If to open it will forfeit your right to save, at least there should be a warning.
1	Beware, this is not Phil Sawyer, aka "Beautiful World", this is a band out of Australia. While it is ok, it is not the same band.
1	This is a $12.99 violation of every musical principle I can imagine. The Dark Side of my wallet, the time spent listening to this utter crap is indeed "ticking away the moments that make up a dull day...fritter and waste the hour (that you'll never get back) in an offhand way." The album is, at best, a tasteless, dull rehashing of an already-dead (no disrespect to Richard) musical namespace. The three Roger Waters solo records are more "Pink Floyd", by an order of exponents, than any of the bunk mustered for Momentary Lapse or Division Bell, and Endless River is a cheap, dentist office, Muzak version of Floyd that deserves no further contemplation.
1	not my kind of music, downloaded them for a funeral
1	UK Maxi Single Track Listing for -  "UNDIVIDED LOVE" - LOUISE  1) Album Version 2) T-Empo Vocal 3) T-Empo Dub 4) Tin Tin Out Mix 5) Studio 54 Mix  1996
1	Not the Bob Dylan we remember from years gone by.
1	Fair, songs were too slow! She has a beautiful voice though. I thought she would be a little more upbeat.
1	This isn't the full song, not only that but it isn't even the real deal. I know it says "remake" but judging from the preview, it wasn't enough to really know the difference. Took the chance to check it out anyway. Not worth it! Not really understanding why it seems impossible to find the real track...
1	Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
1	Barbra does not blend well with the other singers she partners with.
1	I can't review this product.  It's one of my favorite songs, so I downloaded it onto what I assumed would be my Kindle Fire, but it loaded it somewhere on Amazon on a cloud. So I haven't been able to listen to it because I don't have the time to pursue music in an Amazon cloud.  The brief amount of time I dedicated to trying to figure out why it wasn't on my Kindle, I believe it's because it's not a Kindle applicable download. Oh, well.
1	...with his achingly beautiful voice, it was appropriate to give him a pass.  Besides, there was always a good admixture of solid songs to outbalance the weak ones.  Sadly, with Illuminations, that is not the case.  Josh wrote the majority of the songs this time, and they do not measure up, and there are not sufficient covers to truly remedy the lack. I do like the sound of the arrangements.  I can get some enjoyment from the lone song in French and the lone song in Italian; the instrumental prelude pleases.  But I cannot recommend this album.  I hope Josh will put that glorious voice to better use in the future and reconsider whether songwriting is necessarily where he should focus his efforts as he reaches the big "three oh".
1	This is horrible. I wish I could delete this from my memory. I don't know why I ever bought this
1	I thought the days of phony compilation albums full of "hits", recorded by label in-house bands whose names appear in small print in a corner of the record , would be over by this stage of the game. The only original tracks are either bad re-recordings or obscure or b side filler crap. There is nothing here worth paying for.
1	God, Nirvana have to be the most overrated band in existence. People obsess over Nirvana, but stop yourselves and think, aside from alright songwriting skills, what talent did Kurt Cobain really have? he couldn't play guitar, my friend has played guitar for 6 months and can play almost every Nirvana song flawlessly. The riffs are simple and extremely repetitive, along with most of his lyrics, and he sounds like a dying camel when he sings. As for the other members- Dave Grohl is not a terrible drummer, but hes not great either, hes average at best. As for Novoselic, his bass lines are inaudible until Kurt starts whacking his guitar and screaming, and the song settles down again when hes done.  The only reason Nirvana was revolutionary was because they were different. Metal and pop dominated the Tv and radio, which Kurt, unlike anybody else at the time, actively disliked. So, he formed a talentless band and practically revolutionized, if not created, grunge. The only reason so many people like Nirvana is because they haven't heard of any of the other Seattle grunge bands, almost all of which are more talented than Nirvana. So Nirvana comes along, and all of a sudden it sucks to be a teenager and we need to throw away our hairspray and spandex and wear crappy flannel shirts and be depressed.  In my opinion, Kurt killed himself because he soon realized what he had done. After Nirvana started a revolution in crappy music, hundreds of other bands were able to get record deals because they knew thats what the public wanted now, hence the birth of Green Day and pop punk. Green Day released Dookie, and soon hundreds of kids got interested in "punk" because they believed that was what punk was- catchy hooks and simple guitar riffs. Once Green Day got going, music was never the same again. The only metal still alive is classic metal bands making comebacks (Megadeth, Iron Maiden) and new underground VERY talented foreign metal bands (Children of Bodom, In Flames). I believe if Kurt was still alive, even he would be crying because of what he had done to music. no longer do we have fun metal around, we have rap and terrible pop. thanks Nirvana. thanks alot.  If you're debating whether to get this album, dont. by doing this you support a talentless revolution and instead of rebelling against todays music, you are simply buying right into what started it. Its a sad world in music right now, but at least we can live off the underground bands.  As for the album itself: Smells Like Teen Spirit is the only alright song, as it has an infectius guitar riff, but Kurts crappy vocals muddle it. the rest of the songs have crappy simple and repetitive guitar riffs and sound like complete sh*t. not worth a dollar, but i was dumb enough to buy it.
1	Don't get this if you were looking to sing music of the night.
1	pop music. Had to buy it because I was coaching someone to sing it. I figured I'd better hear the song first.
1	Never got the down load! Since they chance the way you download, there's no way to report it! So they get a one or O!!
1	I don't know yet, could you please let me know which is the other cd what songs on it, and if just in spanish, I want music of Roberto Carlos in Spanish, please be advised that before to by any products customers need to know what are they buying ok in this cds say nothing about it we can't read the tracks. I can't give any good feed back if I don't buy them.
1	I did not order this.  There is no "Not Applicable" star to check.
1	I liked this ok but I didn't like it that much because I find it too slow
1	Purchased this song but I never actually received it. It shows I purchased it but I cannot add it to my songs.
1	Love the track, but not very happy I cannot download when it said that I could.
1	I just purchased this based on reading reviews.  Should have been aware of  anything "remastered".  Sound is very muddled.  Now I am unsure  of all reviews that I read on here.  Would have felt taken if I had bought  this in bargain bin much less for this price.
1	What is it with this guy?? Will he ever have the guts to release another album without a "Greatest Hits Package" Tagged onto this new material. This guy for 10 years has re-released the SAME OLD Music! The one time he didn't with a $70 Million Budget, Invincible only sold 2 million copies in the usa. Even though his $70 Million budget was directed to only marketing in the usa.  Why doesn't everyone go to Cnet.com, go to the Downloads Section & get yourself a free Mp3 CD Ripper!  Then get Jackson's first 4 solo albums or really any of his albums, Make Copies of them & then BURN your own CD of your own personal choices of songs!  That in a nutshell is what Michael Jackson has done for 10 years! He knows his new stuff cant stand on its own so then we need Greatest Hits Packages Tagged on OR just release: Box Sets, Number ones, etc,etc..  I have never seen another guy live off his past more then him! Word to the wise, Get yourself a free MP3/CD Ripper, rip your already owned old material and make your own CD's with different selections. Because that is all he is doing!
1	This is the song I sing when I'm trying to mock the state of mainstream country music. Please, go listen to Sturgill Simpson or Jason Isbell before it's too late. Bought for a sketch show, wherein the guy dancing to it is eventually revealed to have sex with pickup trucks. God, this song is awful.
1	Heard this song in a different recording that sounded much better.
1	Let's all PLEASE remember that Andy Warhol suggested that everybody would be famous for 15 MINUTES! At this rate, this absolute LOSER owes us all about 1680 HOURS of repayment! I don't care how much the tweeny-bopper crowd thought they could rersurrect the consistently FAILING efforts of this wanna-be karaoke HACK, the fact is, he wasn't good enough for AI and he sure as HE#@ is NOT even REMOTELY worthy of a RECORDING! The vocal quality of this regurgitated pop vomit serves as nothing more than a reminder of his FAILED efforts on AI. PLEASE save yourself the paltry sum requested for this wretched piece of pop garbage and spend it on something more satisfying and soothing...such as a urethral razor scraping or a scalding soap suds colonic. EITHER of those would be 10-fold more enjoyable than this rejectable caterwauling! I only gav e this ONE STAR just so I could post the review. IT DESERVED A MINUS 5-STARS!
1	Nothing like his other stuff! So damn disappointed! Whale sounds etc..... what happened? Not country at all!
1	I expected more musical growth from the Band.
1	Slightly better rehearsal jam than Afrika.  Everyone is warming up (no voices).  This one is worth at least twenty cents.
1	Strong political views that are ranted about through the media. Refuse to listen to it a second time.
1	This song was not a bad, song, or one that would drive most people nuts...itwas nothing like that & maybe that is why I did not care for it.  All I can really say about it is, this song is just not my kind of music. I like REO Speedwagon, Journey, Elton John, traditional Irish Music & jigs, etc...this was none of that.  It was a very easy listening type of Music...elevator music if you will...I know that there are people that like that kind of music, and if you are one of them, then you will prolly like this...but it's just not my style of music.  I give it 2 stars...and I'm being generous.
1	Only got this for a friend.
1	This is NOT as advertised. It's bootlegged off the old vinyl version, and was mastered WAY too fast (at least on the old vinyl, you could adjust the pitch control on your turntable; as it is, it's maddeningly flawed. But better than not having it at all. But as the fella says, caveat emptor...)
1	I was disappointed in the quality of the item.
1	I've listened to all of Schiff's (downloaded) Bach concertos, and think highly of most of them.  His WTC, as I've heard it on YouTube, is another matter.  Unless the recording and transmission are defective in some way I don't understand, the inner voices of these pieces have a way of beginning, then fading away.  It's important to emphasize the entrances of new contrapuntal lines, but their continuity must also be brought out.  This latter is annoyingly absent.  He brings your attention to an entrance, but then lets it fade into inaudibility.  I'm now looking elsewhere for my WTC listening.
1	Bust A Move was the only good song on this album.  The other songs were just sitting on this album and doing nothing while I listened to this album.  This is basically a one-hit rapper from the 80's and this album is  the same. The other songs aren't nearly as catchy as Bust A Move is.
1	I found myself dissapointed when I first heard this record. I had been expecting somthing different. I let it fall into the depths of my CD book, and stopped listening to it. About 1-2 weeks ago, I thought I would pop it in....Let me just say I was blown away. I don't know how I wrote it off as nothing special when I gave it the first 5 spins or so, but I was amazed that I stopped listening to it. Now enough of that...here is what I truly think of the record.  Let me say that this is not like any other Soilwork CD released thus far. It is along the lines of "Figure Number Five" but adds some elements remenicent of "a Predators Portrait". I find this CD much, much better than "Figure Number.." in the sense that it seems to have more depth, and rawness. Every track gets your head banging at one point or another. Speed creates a beautiful blend of raw vocals, and mixes in the harmonous, singing very nicely. From start to finish....once it grows on you this is a great CD....almost combines their last 4 CD's all into one, but sounds like nothing else they have ever done before. A must have record in 2005!!!  *Update: I don't care for this too much anymore, or this type of music to be honest. The whole scream, sing, scream, sing is soooo played out.
1	I find it quite unfortunate that with every release, The Killers sound worse and worse. This was a pretty big letdown after their highly successful debut, Hot Fuss. I've never really been a huge Killers fan, but I figured I'd give this album a listen after enjoying most of their first one. It was evident from the first five seconds that they'd over do it with the keyboards. For me, keyboards are definately hit-or-miss, and The Killers missed on their sophomore album. Aside from the album being drenched in unnecessary keyboards, it wasn't to incredibly awful. After a few listens, most of the tracks weren't half bad, and I started to focus on the positives. I liked that the album recieved less mainstream attention than their debut and that the album only included one "Mr. Brightside" that was constantly on the radio and everywhere else. Also, I've always really like Brandon Flowers' voice. It's incredibly unique and in a strange way, very soothing.
1	Bought this after reading a rave review in RS magazine. Disappointed. Boring music.
1	This song is a Dr. Seuss rip off. Sing song rhymes that makes me think of nursery rhymes. Terrible song.
1	Item arrived with broken CD case.
1	downloaded only partial download.  Would not play.  This process is very dificult to near impossible to make it work.
1	For a man as talented and professional as Paul McCartney, "Wild Life" is an absolute disgrace! I'm surprised he even released it. Evidently, McCartney believed at the time that he had already made it big and didn't need to make much of an effort to make an album.. . .and he went out of his way to put that theory into practice. The song "Mumbo" sounds like the lunatic ravings of a madman in a straight jacket. There seems to be no point to this song and it was embarrassing to listen to. Even the slow rock songs were half-hearted and clumsily done. If Paul McCartney backed into a microphone and vented gas for the duration of an album he would not have done a worse job.
0	Great classic. I can't believe I found it again. It's a must for an Ipod or just laying around to listen to.
0	I love this song. I like it when Lisa Marie and sing it
0	Good song
0	Love this song.
0	I enjoyed it very much.  A great way to keep focused on the true meaning of the holiday
0	This CD is simply the best. The Best. BEST. It's great, great, great! When talking about Irish folk. I've seen theese guys live and I can tell you - they rock! This CD will take you on a lovely trip out in the nature with the sound of a acoustic guitar and a flute that sounds like birds singing in the early springmorning. At the same time, here are lots of tracks that are really hot with fast drums and intensive verses and fast-played instruments. It's lovely. Sounds like Dan, another Irish folk-band. But Grda is the best. Don't you miss it. The band is a group of young musicians, both men and women, 20-30 years old. I play them to everyone I know and I haven't met a single person yet who did NOT like them. So, this is something impossible to dislike. Go Grda, you're both professional and fantastic musicians! Five stars, without a doubt! :-)
0	he's am amazing singer I love all his songs hope he dose more  love songs  there my favorite  songs he's a great singer
0	Great song  enjoying this plan on using it on a long plane trip, along with other soothing music.
0	This album is not going to be liked by all fans of Massive Attack, or at least not right away. The depth of music of Blue Lines or Protection, or the intensity of Mezzanine seems to be lacking here, although probably everyone will notice that the music is stronger that anything we have heard from Massive Attack in the last 12 years. I would dare suggest that the depth of music is still here, but it has been...relocated. Miles Davis once said that his musical style kept changing on him, just like a curse. Well, after 16 years in business Massive Attack has gone experimental, atmospheric and minimalist all at once. However, all those changes affect mostly the added layers of the background of their music.  I have to say honestly that I have been disillusioned with a lot of new music of various styles, lately, and this new album by Massive Attack to me is one of the nicest musical surprises of the last many months, ever since Porcupine Tree's The Incident was released. The incorporation of the experimental ambient layers of sound in addition to the industrial tones which for a long time have been with Massive Attack makes this album unique to me. The overall mood is mellow, peaceful and reflective but it spreads over a wide sound texture. These songs may sound simple and plain at first, but they do grow on us with repetitive listening. I really feel like with this album the music of Massive Attack positioned itself somewhere between Massive Attack and Radiohead, and that is a perfect place to be in. Really, the Zoviet France like undertones of a few of their new songs (this album hides many jewels in the back of itself and its songs) are exactly the layers which make the music of Radiohead so addictive. The song number 7 for example, reminds me a little bit of Radiohead's Videotape.  I especially like tracks: 8,5,7,9,10,1. Track 1 begins like cover of some bluesy Peter Green song from In The Skies, and then progresses into many different stages and layers. Track 2 is driven by a Joy Division like sounding bass and drum line and it is one of the most energetic songs of the album. Track 3 develops one of the most haunting atmospheric background melodies. Track 4 is full of texture which again, is located at the final minute of a song, a very Radiohead like approach. Track 5 has a Steve Reich like repetitive feeling to it. It is quite beautifully structured with a skillfully interwoven vocal line. Track 6 is very trippy and will probably turn quite a few listeners off. However, there is much more happening here besides the Skinny Puppy like rhythm section which becomes less prevalent as this song progresses. The beauty of track 7 is apparent from the beginning and it has a hypnotic quality. Just play it on repeat 1 and you might experience a beautiful enchanted evenings. Track 8 floats in between Massive Attack, Radiohead and Joy Division, a truly perfect ground. Both tracks 9 and 10 are...very complex... underneath.  Again, please listen to this album quite a few times before you decide that you really don't like it as much. This music will grow on you...
0	Many people, who had just heard Hanging By a Moment, thought this band was a one-hit wonder. I knew, from actually seeing them in concert and listening to their first album (many times) that they were should be the ones topping the charts with their intelligent lyrics about life and learning to think for yourself. With this album, they bring a more rock-mainstream oriented album, but, thank God didn't lose their unique sound and inspiring lyrics. The last album was more about discovering yourself and trying to find your place in the world; while this album is about going through life after finding you do have purpose. Just listen to the lyrics. More groups like this should be on the charts, with inspiring lyrics that leave you, as the listener, to interpret what they mean. And they don't need to scream to do this. You wouldn't believe the songwriter/lead singer Jason Wade is only 22 years old. I encourage you to listen for yourself.
0	Love her!
0	I wonder who she heard calling her name? Waylon?  Heard this song lots of times over the years but this is the best.
0	This song always gets me moving!
0	This is one of my favorite throw backs. Tyrese is singing the hook, it's a classic.
0	I use a lot of music to booey my emotions if I feel them slipping in a negative direction.  This one is great!
0	My daughter loves this song! And, we got it for free with Amazon digital credits :-)
0	As advertised
0	Great
0	Greatest!!!!!
0	If you know Biz Markie's "Doo-doo Rap" and have kids, you will love this children s' album.  Annoying like every other kids album, but with a tad more flavor. The Roots drop a clean song and the Ting-Tings drop a birthday song with a familiar guitar and bass line. :)
0	This is just plain silly...in spite of the fact that is was and still is, politically incorrect.
0	Classic
0	Love it!!
0	I'd die for Brian Fallon
0	I downloaded this, as this is the one song I remember Claude King on the charts with.  the Download was the best way for me to get this song at the cheapest price.  a little history, I understand there was really, a man named Clifton Flowers, and that this song was about him.  I am sure he was paid for that honor.  this is a one hit wonder, I believe.
0	However there is no better rendition than this. This is a moving instrumental that takes one to far off places.
0	I must admit that I knew very little about Bill Jabanoski until I bought his new CD "A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL." By the time I listened to the last cut on that CD, which is absolute genius, for the fourth time, I had my car keys in my hand and was out to buy more of his work. The only CD I found at my local "Megastore" was this one, and I'm glad it was. As another reviewer described it, it really is a masterpiece.    Although you can argue that "A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL" is even better, just because of its non-stop intensity, the range and vision of this CD probably makes it even more of an artistic masterpiece. Everything from a WALMART worker who doesn't realize how she is being taken advantage of, to dire warnings about Bush's intentions in Iraq, to an abused child trying to function as an adult, to damnations of Americans "buying" little girls on the streets of Costa Rica, and to wild, very funny, in a very sad way, satires of our country during the Bush years. It's all here.    As a previous reviewer wrote, this CD is over two hours and twenty-nine songs long, and you won't find a second of it that isn't remarkable and masterful. I'm not a person to overstate compliments, but it is certainly one of the five best albums I've ever heard.
0	Make it home has that crazy up beat that I like.  I love the words 'won't you let me know if your bones made it home alright.  Makes me smile everytime I heard.  I really enjoy this song.
0	Move over Britney, now there's something meatier - and I mean that in a good, tasteful way!!!  This album is HOT, plain and simple.  I heard Jewel's new and unique "Intuition" on the radio today, and my ears are still trying to adapt!!  Was that really a hip-hop drumbeat I heard?  And is Jewel trying to go the way of Britney, totally cool, totally dance and TOTALLY pop?  Looks like it!!  And I, for one, am enthralled that Jewel is maturing and reaching out to be different.  Let's face it, people, this is a pop world, and to not be pop is to not be cool.  Like the Spice Girls and Madonna of a different age, Jewel is coming to grips with herself and her music through pop, and I, for one....oops, sorry - I just said that... Well, as I mentioned before, it takes true courage to be yourself and try a different sound.  From what I've heard of this album so far, there's lots of trip-hop, lots of dance, and totally lots of fun POP!!  I'm glad Jewel is no longer an Alaskan hippie, and is instead a girl with a new attitude!! You go, girl.....the days of your white van are loooong gone!!!! SEE YA' LATER!!!!!
0	Never heard of this until today.  This was used to close the Tom Marr show.  It blew me away!
0	I love the song trumpets
0	Not a fan of One Direction in any way; however, this song is really cool. It's definitely one of the better ones for 2013.
0	Recently found this band on YouTube. Have been listening to them nonstop ever since. I bought both this CD and Blurryface and they both have so many great songs. I found this band touches quite a few different genres of music, sometimes in the same song. I have to danced to their songs, sang their songs, and cried to their songs. This music is good. Buy it!
0	super!
0	This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!
0	Great album.  There is nothing I don't like.
0	The CD is overflowing with divine messages -  you won't be disappointed!!!  I'd love to see him on the North Sea Jazz Festival circuit so the world can hear him, know him, love him.  Motown Marketing Dept, get moving!!!
0	Still listening to it.
0	This song is musically beautiful, and the lyrics seem to speak to me far too often. Cyndi Lauper's voice is expressive and this song is so touching.
0	I love this song and wanted it for my Kindle.  I think this version is better than the Eagle's version.
0	As a huge fan of The xx (including their underrated sophomore album "Coexist"), it's taken me awhile to warm up to Jamie xx. I wasn't a big fan of the remix collaboration he did with Gil Scott-Heron, and some of his other post-xx work hasn't really stuck with me. However, "In Colour" has me sold on Jamie xx as a solo artist.  This is a strong album with a little bit for every music fan. There's dance, rave, EDM, minimalist, electronic, pop, rap, jazz, and every other sub-genre in between. On this album, Jamie xx proves himself a master of blending genres without overdoing anything. He even gives some nods to The xx on a few tracks, which will surely excite fans of the band.  The album flows well together, whether the songs are big and bold or intimate and chill. It's the type of album that comes full circle and works great on repeat. It's probably an album best listened to on headphones, and you'd probably enjoy it more with the lights off. But you could also play it at a party and keep people on the dance floor.  The highlights of the album include "Gosh," "Loud Places," "SeeSaw," and "I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)." But there really aren't any duds on here. At times it may feel like Jamie xx is playing it too safe, but that's only to the untrained ear that isn't looking for the subtlety in this music. These songs are rich and have plenty to offer on repeat listens. There's plenty here that's catchy, and the album as a whole moves the soul.  Jamie xx has proven himself as a solo artist, not just a producer or remix artist. This is a colossal achievement for his proper debut, and I look forward to more Jamie xx in the future.
0	I found out about her when she opened the show for Ed Sheeran in early November and I looked her up and immediately bought her two EPs. Her songs are just so relatable and refreshing and I listen to it almost every day.....Tori Kelly is absolutely amazing!!
0	As I said before, this robe looks good is very well stitched and warm. I bought it for my wife for a gift and she loves it. I would reccomend it.
0	Always been a fan, I love most of his music. This one makes me want to listen to it over and over again.
0	in my opinion - the best alice in chains song
0	Zane hasn't disappointed fans yet but this album knocks it out of the park!  If you ever get a chance to see him live, do it but be careful. If you get too close and are having too good of a time, you may end up with his hat on your head and a mic in your face leading the crowd with Zane backing you up!  He's a blast for crowds of all ages!  You'll also find a genuine good guy that will entertain a crowd with or without a guitar or a song.  You'll also find a dedicated and loving family man that puts the important things ahead of everything else and tries to balance that with building a career.  He's an inspirational song writer that seems to take the easy road, or maybe it's the hard road, writing about his life and what he experiences which is probably why so many of his songs touch people of all walks of life.  "While I was away" will rinse your eyes unless you don't have a heart, or kids.  It's true, it's real and you feel it.  "Overnight success" speaks for itself.  It's a funny, truthful account of what some people think and it makes you smile and appreciate the story of the best of the best of authentic artists.  It's well worth watching the video of his performance of that song at the Texas Heritage Songwriters Association in Austin (from Episode 17 of Troubadour Texas TV series). He's in the company of legends and had to be shaking in his boots, yet you can't tell, and he kills it!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4CrPNpYv8  This album was an instant buy for me, just based on track 1 and 11 but everything in between is no less a gem!  Be sure to check out previous albums as well. Kylie Rae Harris (also a Texas singer/songwriter) sings harmony with Zane quite a bit at shows which is a treat in itself.  Be sure to looks for "Carlos and Maria" with Kylie singing harmony; it's another home run!  God Bless Texas and the unparalleled Texas music scene!!
0	I enjoyed this album. It is a change from traditional "traditional", but not contemporary.  Worth a download! At least go through the samples and give it a listen!
0	I wanted music from this time period, and this one is just as I expected; a good deal of piano and some vocal.
0	THIS SONG IS AWESOME!! You have to listen to this song. It has a good beat and I always sing along to it.
0	I know the men in the group had other jobs, but it was a wonderful collaboration of talented men. I wish there was more music from them. The song describes how you can be in love and the effects of that is shown on your face.
0	Timeless!  This is Gladys Knight & The Pips at their best!

0	Love it
0	Very upbeat, Shazaam'ed it during the Walter Mitty movie!
0	But, it is still a nice collection.  It was a steal at $1.99, but it would still be a bargain for more than that.
0	I did not know this music existed. I have always loved the energy and drive of metal, but the lyrics are just not me. Most metal bands, if they go political, seem to be anarchists. I am pretty conservative. I am angry, but not at the things these bands are - quite the opposite, actually.   As to my faith, I had grown to feel that the ritual of faith is a quiet comfort, but for the most part private and in the background. This music has changed that -  I now feel my faith is alive and well. It's something to sing about! I still keep it basically private, but it now makes me feel happy, rather than just comfortable. I smile as I sing along with the songs on this album. There's not a bad, or even a so-so, song on it.  Good music, guys.

0	Enjoy every song. This was a replacement for one I wore out
0	Great gift for my Dad.
0	It has been a long time since I listened to an album where each song made me so eager to hear the next one.  How I missed this guy for 14 years and 8 albums is a mystery to me.  Great songs, sharp writing about coping with hard times with independence and pride.  Hard driving, engaging music with clear vocals, painting an honest portrait.  Buddy Miller harmonizes on a couple of cuts and John Prine joins in on a verse on the title song.  Buy it!
0	Another awesome album by Aaron.
0	Excellent.  Her voice is phenomenal.  I can't stop listening.  I am holding my breath for her next album.  Hope it will be more jazz oriented.
0	-  the best, these guys...
0	I love,love,love this mans voice! It has just as much soul as Otis Redding or any other great soul artist you can think of. Set the candles up, draw a warm bath, and let his voice melt your cares away. Well worth buying!!!
0	Takes you back...
0	Just the song i was looking for. Great quality. Can't beat out
0	Good old school material.
0	This is a very good album to listen to over and over again. Not too bad for those highway rides. Only wish it had a couple more songs on it. What voice control this girl has!!
0	Such a great song! This is the long version! Even though it's a low price this is the long version
0	I first heard this on  a comp CD.  It was the first track to get a hold of me and take me for a trip.  I love the dreamy trance stuff with vocals,a nd this song is in that musical vein.  I love the musical lay out of this song, but when you pair this layout with sweet vocals you put me in a place thatisnothign short of EUPHORIC.  This song does that well, and on top of it all, it's not a popular song.  I hate getting a hold of a great song only to hear it played out in clubs and on the radio.  This song is laced with a lovely cresendo, and a lovely break, which again builds to that soaring cresendo.  If you like trance on a dreamy tip with beautiful female vocals that hypnotise you, then this is for you.  So whatcha waiting for, go get it!!! "Your eyes are sparkling bright, reflecting in the velvet sky, why don't you realize, we're lost in velvet skies.".  If you like this song, also try out Ultra 5 Featuring Cee Jay "Potion"  Great mix by LANGE!!....*SIGH*......take me away.....Sashah
0	THIS IS A TRUE MASTERPIECE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS WONDERFUL. FROM THE MUSIC TO THE AMAZING ART WORK ON THE COVER. "MARY ANN" AND "PARADISE" ARE GREAT BUT "WINGS OF LOVE" IS THE GREATEST TEMPTATION SONG EVER RECORDED.
0	Another no-brainer. This sampler is jam-packed with great music and if you like Latin music, it is a keeper. In the flavor of Sergio Mendez (IMO), I thoroughly enjoy this.
0	I can not say enough good things about this album. It is Josh's best work to date. "Straight to You" is the most beautiful song I have ever heard and I have seriously listened to it on repeat over and over for days. I don't think I could ever get sick of this song. When Josh performed "My December" in concert a few years ago, I knew he had a rock side and I totally fell in love with it. This album is the perfect reflection of that side of him. He writes beautiful music and when he picks songs from others, he picks beautiful songs and then makes them amazing. My husband thinks Josh has some sort of tremulousness to his voice that I honestly don't hear and don't think I would care if I did. I love Josh's tone and I think this album is his best singing so far. I love all of Josh's music and this album definitely did not disappoint. It is the best album I have heard in years. Other highlights are "The War at Home" and "Bells of New York City" but I honestly can't think of one bad song on this album. Galileo is not one of my absolute favorites of his but the song has a nice sentiment. Awesome Awesome Album.
0	I got these for my daughter for Christmas. She is  loving them, posted a selfie  on FB of her rocking them. Really, soft, well made and just right!
0	Great old song! Highly recommend!
0	I own this CD got it directly from Toby Knapp himself and he even autographed my copy!! Thats one of the great deals you get when you know him  as I do! But this is one of the most amazing instrumental CD's I have ever heard! Toby is a very gifted guitarist and one of the best!! Must buy very well done and never gets boring!!
0	love this song! Downloaded this for my ringtone was super easy to get on my phone and use.  Will download from amazon again super easy.
0	Love the song!
0	I like the beat, the chorus and message in the song. I heard it on a reggae station on TV and instantly loved it. Sad message in the song but sounds so upbeat,lol
0	The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely.. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing.. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls !!!!!!!

0	One of the best owl city records of all time! Thanks for the great music!
0	Me and my mom love this CD we both love patsy cline
0	QUEEN MARY SAID: 'LET'S CELEBRATE; SO HENRY YOU COOPERATE' THO HE FOUND IT DEMEANING TO COMPLY, IT REALLY WAS 'DO OR DIE'! Henry Purcell (1659-1695) looked like a Florentine prince, was hail-fellow-well-met in tavern and taproom, wrote for the church and also for the stage and salon, was in fact a most likeable young man, as well as a "very great Master of Musick."  Except for his appointment as organist at the Chapel Royal and other churches, his compositions were the chief events of his life. Henry Purcell invented the English celebratory style in music.  His odes were often written for various groups and annual celebrations.  Purcell's ode 'Welcome to all the Pleasures' was composed for an inaugural celebration in 1683 for a group of musicians that made up a so-called "Musical Society".  'Of old, when heroes thought it base', the so-called 'Yorkshire Feast Song',was composed in 1690 for the otherwise obscure annual London gathering of York nobility.  'Come, ye sons of art, away' was the ode for what was to be Queen Mary's last birthday-April 30 1694.  It is the least ostentatious of the birthday odes. This ode is a countertenor's dream, for Purcell favours this voice as the soloist throughout.  The famous duet recorded by many countertenors "Sound the Trumpet" is in this ode.  It is my personal favorite, though I like them all.  You really couldn't have a better performance of this music than is on this disc.  The Choir of the English Consort and the English Concert all put together by Trevor Pinnock. The soloists are the best, my favorite being countertenor: Michael Chance with his lovely voice and intelligent delivery of the music AND tenor John Mark Ainsley And bass Michael George who are experts at interpreting the music of Purcell.  All other soloists are very good indeed.  Such an entertaining disc!!!!!
0	It's a shame this album had such terrible distribution. It's really one of Jonathan's best. It combines his wonderful childish playfulness with an evolving, maturing emotion in his songwriting. Corner Store is brilliant, Shirin and Fahrad and It's You are standouts as well. hoping this is re-released some day so many more people can enjoy it.
0	OK, I met Jerry Lee and his wife at a Laurie Morvan Band concert. She gave me his card, I checked the band out on facebook, and saw they had recorded a CD. So I ordered it - what a great surprise! Yes, I did expect it to be "good", but MoJo Palace is "EXCELLENT". These guys need to be discovered - their stuff is right up there with the very best red hot blues rock around anywhere! The lead guitar and bass are amazing, the singing is absolutely great and Jerry Lee's voice has a very unique quality to it. The songs are all original and are very definitely NOT stuff you've heard everywhere else. This album has got to be one of the best albums that I've never heard of. These guys are good - you will not regret ordering this CD!!
0	Beautiful lyrics and music.
0	This is a gorgeous guitar piece. I'm still trying to figure out how 1 person can sound like 2 guitar players!  Time to take some lessons.  :>)
0	Brings back memories!
0	Great song to put you in a mellow mood.  You can easily get caught up in the music and just let yourself go.
0	I was lucky enough to have been there in person for this concert. DMB is the most amazing live band I have ever seen. They just get on stage and have a public jam session. It doesn't feel like they are putting on a show just hanging out and playing music. Has all the great classics.
0	Fabulous
0	Good
0	Just really like this song. Been one of my favorite elvis songs as long as i can remember. Buy it
0	Love it
0	Blake at his best! Fun loving song. Paints a picture of a couple totally enjoying each other.
0	I live near Mexico and spend a lot of time there. I have always been curious about the exact experience that the young New Yorker had that sent him  back to the Big Apple in such a dilapidated state of mind.
0	Love the grooves on every track of this album. The recording is tight and clear without too much audience noise. As a fan, it's a must-have.
0	My husband sings this one for me every Christmas season and we listen to it performed by a variety of people.
0	Unless you are a real country music fan, there are only two or three songs on this album that are good enough to appeal to a general audience, including Tennessee Whiskey.
0	Like an eloquent writer, Amethystium's music is clear and effective at putting you in a relaxed, imaginary state leading to the potential to help you unleash the best parts of you.
0	Until I looked this song up for availability, I had no idea that it was titled "Orinoco Flow" - I had always assumed it was called "Sail Away", for obvious reasons! Wonderful song - very soothing to listen to & quite a melodious piece! Eithne N Bhraonin, also known as Enya Brennan, is perhaps Ireland's top female singer and she shows exactly why with this song - like her original group, Clannad, all of her stuff is wonderful to listen to - from her theme song from the film "Titanic" ("Only Time") to this - it's all GREAT stuff...!!
0	Two words: BUY THIS! It is an awesome club-cut. Dynamite beats and breaks! Some DJ's have kind of laid off of playing this because of 16'S new stuff, but they should still give this a whirl every so often. It can still get a crowd hyped. Check it and the rest of his stuff out for some nice ear-candy. If you liked my review, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!
0	Very pleased.
0	I have spent the day listening to this album and my impressions are the vocals at times remind me of Marilyn Manson from the Dope Show song and the music is very industrial sounding almost a mixture of Nine Inch Nails and Ministry with possibly some Linkin Park mixed with Plants vs Zombies.  Some songs sound like club music at times but they still have an energy to them.  I really like this new sound but I had nothing wrong with his old sound even though this is only their third album its great that things got changed up and it leaves me wondering what will come next.  The music has lots of thumping and crunchy effects but it fits very well yet its very simple sounding.  You know what I mean its quick riffs like wah wah rah rin.  Nothing fancy just music with a horror theme and I must say I absolutely love it.  The chorus is what I find when the songs ramp up into awesomeness.  The first five songs are pretty much the ones that I find are the greatest but it took me a while to like the majority of their songs from the other albums.  The others will probably grow on me eventually just like the other albums.  But those first five songs are just fantastic.  It is like Rob Zombie though more industrial but I have always enjoyed Zombie's music so that's not a problem at all.  Scum of the Earth has more of the Great American Nightmare, Superbeast or Demon Speeding songs vibe to it than anything else.  Well that's what my ears tell me at least.  The new sound is what will shy some away of course because it really doesn't sound the same as the previous albums.  The vocals are unmistakable for Riggs and he is very distinct in what he sounds like.  So really if you don't like when musicians change their stuff up you may end up hating this album.  I was sitting with my wife in the car and she commented on thinking it was Rob Zombie from his voice and sound.  I think Scum of the Earth have defined what they will sound like and they are distinct yet very familiar.  Its kind of familiar in the since that how you can hear Metallica, Slayer, Ministry, Mudvayne, NIN, ACDC or Zombie and know who they are just from their sound.  All I can say is get some samples and see if you like it since music is difficult to review since our taste are so much different from each other.  I can't comment on the cd artwork or anything since I downloaded the mp3 album.  The one issue is the length with songs being relatively short being around three minutes and I was wishing these songs were at least four minutes or more.  The album is only around thirty minutes or so which is not long at all.  I think the enjoyment of a new album makes it worth it to me.
0	I love this song!! She does a great job and the words are awesome. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
0	There should be extra stars available for truly special albums like this.
0	Oozes Bond, yet totally Sam. A perfect combination.
0	Love this track.
0	I got this to listen to in the car when I am driving in insane city traffic. It is so soothing and there are a lot of songs that I already know. Plus with so many songs, how can you turn it down for the price? So cheap. The music has a great quality as well, and very pleasant to listen to.
0	i never knew who sang this song until i saw pbs showcase the oldies acts. i always loved this tune.
0	This is a great song to get your anger out when someone has taken advantage of you.  You can feel the emotion in the lyricas and the music.
0	To some R&B is dead music field in the mainstream, however there are some singers ,Eric Roberson & Kem to name a few who are still delivering classic albums. On his fourth album in his six year solo career, Bobby V (previously known as Bobby Valentino) shows his growth not only as artist vocally but his maturity as well. From wearing jeans and a t-shirt on his first album, Bobby is now rocking a suit like a grown man is supposed. The album lead by the lead single Words is ballad heavy which are where Bobby is the strongest. Longtime producers Tim & Bob contribute six songs to this project including the grown & sexy If I Can't Have while Bryan-Michael Cox gives us the concert ready Sweetness. To my surprise Bobby also covers the classic Bobby Brown song Rock Witcha to great success. There's a few songs on here which feature guest appearances from rappers 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks & Piles which came off as filler to me, but they don't take away from the strength of this album. Bobby V may not be a strong a singer as KEM or Will Downing, however with Fly On The Wall he shows that he does deserve a place in the R&B world and I look forward to his next album release.
0	Great song! So enjoyable to groove to while working in the office - brings back good memories of family parties and such.
0	I admit to not having heard R. Kelly's "Trapped In the Closet," though from what I've learned about the song it's probably not one I would enjoy, due to being extremely long, explicit, and full of weirdness.  And apparently some people expected "Weird" Al's parody of the song to be even weirder than the original, since he has a knack for taking popular songs and making them bizarre but fun.  But apparently Al decided the original was strange enough, and that to truly make his parody funny he needed to make it as banal and boring as possible.  So instead of a saga about a man's infidelity and the web of lies and strangeness it weaves, it becomes the tale of a bored suburban couple going through a fast-food drive-thru for dinner.  And despite the utterly normal subject matter, Al manages to make the song hilarious.  Maybe it's the dead-serious tone Al takes throughout the song.  Maybe it's the dramatic buildup to completely inane moments like the husband forgetting his wallet or someone's cell phone ringing.  And maybe it's just the fact that you sit through the song waiting for something to happen... and the dramatic reveal at the end turns out to be forgetting the onions on his burger.  But somehow the song is all the more hilarious for being so utterly banal.  Had "Weird" Al tried to pump the lyrics full of weirdness in order to top the original song, he probably would have made something that turned off many listeners, but by going the opposite route, somehow his song is all the funnier.  Sadly, the MP3 of this song is currently unavailable on Amazon.  But the entire album is well worth your money, and this song, though one of Al's longest, is well worth your time.
0	I loved Sigh No More, and counted the days to the release of this new album.  I couldn't imagine that it could be as good as their first. Well, it is not as good...it is BETTER!  At least for me, it is lyrically superior to Sigh No More.  The songs seem to have deeper meaning and more spiritual depth. It is an amazing set of songs and I don't see how anyone could be disappointed.
0	It stirs the blood before going into battle in the SCA.  Heard it before and wanted my own copy of it.
0	I'm an old guy (56). I depise anything new. Change at my age (?), I don't think so...and then came Robert Randolph! Because I try to stay clear of new music, Christian music and any form of soul, rap or hip-hop I had no idea who this young man was?  I do know a fella by the name of Eric Clapton. When I got wind Eric was having a concert for his charity called "Crossroads Guitar Festival", I wanted to go. Alas, it wasn't possible but I bought the DVD. Each and every guitar player on that stage was hand picked and invited by Eric because he enjoyed THEIR music. All of the living blues legends were there. Other artists like a country guy, then James Taylor with the help of Joe Walsh to help pull his portion out and more players I wasn't endeared to. Then Robert, hidden on side stage played with those blues masters on a pedal steel guitar. Now I was never a country lover, I've been a singer/harp player since 1965. I'll even admit to performing with a country band just long enough to steal their lead guitar player. Steel guitars are supposed to whine like my harps, aren't they? Now here's this kid playin' with Robert Cray, Jimmy Vaughn and Buddy Guy! The concert was fantastic but only one player got me to come to Amazon to buy. That would be Robert Randolph. His style reminded be of Brother Duane Allman.  Unclassified is good work as is "Live at the Wetlands" but I am patiently waiting for a CD/DVD dedicated to the BLUES.
0	I've loved this song since it came out long time ago.
0	Takes you to a beautiful place...very therapeautic!  I bought this music at a stressful time and it's truly a masterpiece.
0	yes
0	There are two versions of this song by Marcia Lewis. This one is a Halloween version. I would recommend the other u unless you are using it for a Halloween celebration. Great song for preschoolers!!!
0	One of my absolute favorite songs from this artist. She has a gorgeous voice, in my opinion, and fits this melancholic song perfectly. Highly recommend this song to anyone who's a fan of Lana.
0	such a great song!
0	Very happy with my purchase.  Thank you very much.
0	Funny song. Sounds great. I can't believe I found this after all these years to share with my 9 y.o. son.
0	I love this song. I'm getting married and this is going to be my Daddy daughter dance I'm so excited!
0	adele is a new artist for me. I heard this song and had to find out who performed it. I purchased it and have played it many times already. Love the beat.
0	I appreciate the great condition,low price and fast mail. Very Lovely.
0	An absolutely beautiful song; it touches the soul, Sawyer has a way of doing that, though. If you're contemplating buying, JUST DO IT! So good. So so good.
0	This is second Teddy Wilson CD in my library - other one also excellent is "And then they wrote".  Good standards - straight up.  Recording quality excellent in my opinion, especially consider these are early recordings (1939-40).
0	PLEASE release another album soon. I love this woman's powerful voice, love her heart for God, love the music, the lyrics. "Here's My Heart" is my favorite song on the album, but I love them all, actually. Lauren, God has blessed you with great talent. Give us more, please! More for Him!
0	Lenny created a great collections of songs about love. His vocals and guitar work were right on.
0	Good beat great sound. To me it let's people know they can do good. He/She needs to have faith. Something I'm low on. I'm probably not the only one.
0	I cannot believe that this middle aged soft rock and country music fan just purchased a song by a heavy metal band. I've always loved this song. This remake of this song transcends the original in a very unexpected way. The depth of emotion and sheer power in this version is amazing. Bravo!
0	Beautiful voice
0	So much variety i really dig their new music. No two songs are alike, yet they manage to stay true to their roots.
0	Was pretty easy to download.  Would be nicer if you could choose the desired format.  Good environmentally friendly song. 
0	THis is a must have if you are interested in music and singers, he is the best ever. Anyone who has ever become a singer of any merit learned something from this man.
0	Great Song
0	Saw/heard Red for the first time at WinterJam this year and they put on a good show.  Like the harder christian rock and this album has a nice mix of harder rock with easier going sound.
0	I love Bruno.  I'm 65 and I love to dance....Keep making those songs, Bruno!
0	this song has blessed so many in our congregation.  a truly beautiful song to sleep by!!  bless you and yours kirk
0	Great album!
0	I am not a pianist... I do however, thoroughly enjoy well-executed and brilliantly composed original piano pieces.  I stand in awe at the power of this piece to transport my spirit [and embody the power of music as art].  Carly Comando's flawless performance of her emotionally embracing piece is wonderful.  From the first note to the last, 'Everyday' takes the listener upon a thought-provoking journey through imagination and time  an excursion that I could happily take everyday!  A modern classic!
0	A++
0	So, i lol'ed when i peeped this album art. It is hilar. WTF is a cat doing with a flute! Who came up with this font? Matilda the Witch? RL Stein?  It doesn't matter. This album is just super relaxing... and super free. AND you can use the font on the cover as a template for your tattoo that reads, "Not all who wander are lost." Would also be excellent script to label your personal miniature model of Stonehenge.  No, really, the album is nice and relaxing.
0	I heard this again on an '80's station and had to buy the MP3.  I was not disappointed.  I've listened to it so many times.  Makes me want to dance.
0	I love this song
0	I absolutely adore this song
0	Great, definitely not a disappointment, so glad I got this Album !!
0	Yes, my Mom and Dad bought this album for me, back in the 70's, complete with the "autographed" card, and I wore it out on the turntable!  A few years ago my Mom found it in the discount Xmas CD bin at Wal-Mart and bought it for me as a surprise. It brought back many memories. Even tho I'm 43 years old now, out of all the Christmas CDs I own this is the one I listen to the most.  Love it!  Who doesn't like to hear a little David Cassidy during the holidays??
0	Anthony does it again he is unstoppable with this hit.!!!!
0	I know it's youth-sentiment speaking, but I must admit that every time I listen to this excellent collection of De Groot's early work, I am moved. Most of these songs where written by the duo De Groot -Lennaert Nijgh, and what a cooperation it was. Since this was the sixties quite a bit of it was political as in the protest-songs "Welterusten Mijnheer de President" (Goodnight Mr President) about the Vietnam war, and the haunting "De Eeuwige Soldaat" (The Eternal Soldier), but most of it was sheer poetry "Het Land van Waas en Maal" , "Testament" and the teary, but wonderful "Verdronken Vlinder" (Drowned Butterfly).In short: a delight. De Groot was born in 1944 and produced his last album in 2007, recently he has also announced that he is retiring completely from the music scene.
0	My friend is a big fan, she really enjoyed this album!
0	Love this song and the quality is great. Totally worth it. I made a CD with it and its sound is quality. Easy to downlaod after I read the directions.
0	Very gentle meditating and soothing voice....though it could have been longer, maybe it was just that I wanted it to go on.  Very relaxing.
0	love for years cant sing a bad song
0	LOVE IT
0	heard this JH song at a bbq this summer n loved it; it's a great song for a warm summer night!
0	love this song
0	Excellent
0	LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!
0	love it !
0	I love this song. It make feel good every time I hear it!!!!
0	awesome song
0	Beautiful song!!!
0	We did a video of the halloween creatures I made in the yard and it seemed so real definetly matched the theme I created Lots of fun. Even the neighbors were looking out their  windows ( Funny)
0	From when Fleetwood Mac was a blues band without the girls. Back when they were good. Peter Green wrote some excellent songs. Danny Kirwan was his your protege and kicked it with all he had. Great stuff. Albatross was an excellent song. This is a rare version.
0	This album is absolutely the crown of everything good that the 80's rock bands aspired to in terms of energy and attitude. The first six songs- Shotgun Sally, Nine Lives, Her Monkey, Whip it Out, Long Way From Home and Coast to Coast- are top notch high tempo, face-ripping hard rock, dripping raw energy and sleaze despite the ultra polished production. The album's one "eh" point is next with the customary ballad "Every Sunrise", a few steps above the typical vomit-inducing dreck of the day like Warrant's "Heaven", but still little more than breathing room before picking up again with the funkier mid-tempo "Evil Angel" and "Bad Boys are Back"(great song despite the cringeworthy title), then sprinting to the finish with high speed closer "Heaven on a Heartbeat". Is it deep? Of course not, it's 1989. But if you want to push the envelope beyond Poison and Warrant and the like, without going full-on metal, take a listen to this band....and don't blame me for the speeding ticket.
0	Nice groove and great lyrics. What's not to like?
0	i have loved this song since it first came out. Hailie calls it a shameful song but the feelings needed to be let out. i can identify and love how catchy she was able to make it.
0	beat is awesome/bass
0	Everyone, especially Christians, should have this song. I first heard it when the worship band in my church played it before communion. The words, "His arms are open" welcomes everyone to belong to Jesus.
0	Love Three Dog Night
0	Just simply beautiful  We will miss you Prince.  You were a blessing.
0	My kids love it from school.  Thats good enough for me.
0	Love the music, fantastic artistry.  Very soothing, enjoyable sounds.  Awesome.
0	Their cover of Keith Richards "Bitch" is really hot. The rest of the CD is written by the girls, "Wait A Minute" by Samantha Fish, with Cassie Taylor singing has the blues flowing through you. "Leaving Chicago" by Cassie Taylor starts strong with a nice guitar lead in. Dani Wilde's "Are You Ready" also has some strong guitar work. These three ladies compliment each other vocals and guitar work. I love it and recommend it to give your CD collection some diversity.
0	Love I love listening to her music This song makes think of home Raised Oklahoma with tornados I love the song Sweet revenge is nice lol
0	These are our favorite hymns arranged for piano. I recently used the CDs for prelude music at a Memorial Service.  Great for blocking the noise and spending time with God.
0	Home Free is amazing as usual!! How can you lose with a legend like Kenny Rogers.
0	I heard this song at my church,  and then found it on here. It lifts me up. That's why I listen to it over and over again. Great song!
0	Excellent CD Very hard to find in Europe, because of the change of label company. The last real Jeanne Mas style of her discography.
0	Heard this song on a Survivor Man trailer. Love the bass line and drums in the beginning. Hard pumping. They say there's no guitarist in the band? I certainly hear one in the song. Great for the work-out playlist.
0	If you like a bluesy sound, this one is for you. All Ray Wylie's songs tell a story and this one is really good. I really like this one.
0	Great song
0	Wonderful Celtic music!
0	Good listen. Well worth waiting for.
0	Classic Jodeci.
0	I love Hezwkiah Walker
0	I love this song
0	I first heard this song in the movie "Ghost Ship", it was kick ass Senza has a great voice and really brings it to this song.
0	I have never heard of this singer before, but thanks to an episode of American Dad!, I'm a fan. this is a great song, and it's sad that a lot of people will miss out on it. Recommend it to all your friends!
0	These guys are all super-talented musicians!  It's nice to see jazz and funk brought together in a new way, the album is great!  But it doesn't do their live shows justice.  They must be seen to be believed.
0	I've always loved Gaga, and have admired her innovation throughout the years. This song at first, seemed disappointing and like it was missing something. But I was wrong, I listened to it a few more times and then realized what this song is. It is a transitional piece into a somewhat more substantial and complex. The song has some artpop (genre) elements to it, its not just a major chord progression, but some complex melodies and dynamic changes. I love this song, and can't wait for the full album of ARTPOP. Love you mother monster!
0	after all these years this album is still absolutely amazing!
0	I LOVE this Album!!  I play it almost non-stop.  Its very relaxing to listen to and although some of the songs do have lyrics for the most part its just instrumental.  Quite a few of the songs are ones you would recognize from - say the Sinatra era.  Its great and I will purchase more of her albumns soon!

0	The new additions of two new singers has only made the group better.  Emmet has quicky become one of my favorites.  His voice is truly wonderful and delivery of songs is outstanding.  The best song on the CD however is done by Keith.  Now We Are Free is one of the best things he has ever done.  Did not know he had such a great range of voice and style.  The other songs are all great to listen to also.
0	A fanstastic album from beginning to end. It flows well sonically. Paak is a fantastic story teller as well as musician, his raspy voice also flows as an instrument on every track, can't imagine another artist on the music on the album. I feel it was a great add to my ever growing vinyl collection.
0	this is my second favorite song i like it because of mikky ekko!!!!i love to listen to ti and so does my friend alexa
0	I like this cd because it featured great songs that were sung by great singers. Lyrics, music, and voices are superb.
0	This is a feel good song with a smooth, flowing rhythm. It is the first track in their 1980 album' After Midnight 'and was written by Leo Graham and Paul Richmond. The song won a Grammy Award for Best R and B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1981.  When I hear it in my car, I can't resist turning the volume up, rolling down the windows on a sunny day and cruise on.
0	If you like a real nice song to listen to this is and oldie but very good to sit back and enjoy
0	Love the music Inspirational, had great enthusiasm. I love the harmony and melodies. Unique Christian singers, keeps me focused on what really matters
0	My baby girl loves it! Every time I put it in she's dancing from start to finish!!!!!
0	Amazing!!
0	I'm a Hans Zimmer fan so will find it hard to give less than five stars.  Great movie made even better with great soundtrack.
0	I found this song listed as #51 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Dylan Songs. They describe the song that won Dylan his only Oscar as "...it's basically the evil twin of 'The Times They Are A-Changin'". According to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Still-on-the-Road-The-Songs-of-Bob-Dylan-1974-2006/dp/1556528442/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Still on the Road: The Songs of Bob Dylan, 1974-2006</a>&nbsp;by Clinton Heylin, Dylan completed the recording of this song in just two takes.
0	LOVE IT!!
0	Can anyone deny that the Beatles are one of the greatest, if not the greatest rock group ever? Help is an early rock album that you can listen to end-to-end and never get tired of it. The album has some of my old favorites, including the title song Help, Ticket to Ride, and Yesterday. Altogether, this is great 60s rock..
0	I have always considered Bobby Womack to be my favorite soul singer and this song confirms that for me. I put it on repeat and play it for at least two hours.  I love this song. A true B W classic.
0	This song is awesome!
0	I have owned this LP since 1974 and it is one of my favorite obscure ballet scores.  Adam's music is catchy and charming and stands up nicely to its more famous counterpart, "Giselle".  Bonynge delivers a brilliant and sparkeling pereformance.  I missed purchasing it on CD when it was available and I have been kicking myself ever since!  If you have a love of ballet music and own a working turntable, I suggest purchasing this lovely recording.
0	If you like Christian music, this belongs on your shelf.
0	My tween granddaughter liked this as a gift.
0	Personal favorite. Huge hit in UK. Maybe not so much in the US. But if you were around 55years ago your very likely to recognize it. Great song. Has been covered by other artists but this is the definitive version.
0	This album proves again that Josh has a fantastic voice and these songs were definitely in his wheelhouse. I am one of those who has been disappointed in his last couple albums, because quite frankly, he is not nearly a good enough songwriter to do justice to his own voice. He is much better when he covers songs written by others. Everyone wants to be a singer/songwriter, but not everyone can do both well. Josh has too good a voice to waste it as he did on "All That Echoes." Naturally, at first listen, I enjoyed the songs I was familiar with, but I expect that I will come to appreciate the lesser known selections as well. The only sour note was Kelly Clarkson's strident performance in "All I Ask of You." It needed a better soprano to come in on the high note.
0	Great song!
0	I LOVE THIS EVERY SONG.
0	Typical Sister Hazel.  A CD you can listen to from beginning to end and enjoy every song.
0	Great Song !
0	great
0	This song begins with a full orchestra playing a classical movie sound track. Drums enter along with an ominous bass synthesizer. It is punctuated by distant bird-like synthesized sounds, along with an odd, semi-guttural synthesized sound. I don't like the last sound as it seems distracting but it only lasts for a minute or less. The orchestra makes an occasional return. In the middle there is a melodic classical piano solo. The drums and bass synthesizers begin again with a return to the opening sequence which is a reprise of the first half. It ends with the return to the piano solo with faint violin triplets (possibly synthesized).  Overall the song has a progressive feel with a bit of techno electronica pop overlay.
0	Sweet
0	Love my new CD! I received it on time for my dance performance. The sound and quality of the recording was great! The seller was amazing, communicating with me to ensure that it arrived on time.
0	IN JAPAN. THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED ONLY LP RECORD. SO I WAIT THAT THIS ALBUM RELEASE BY CONPACT DISC. NOW I HAVE GREAT SOUND CD VERSION. I'M VERY VERY HAPPY.
0	My girlfriend lost our first copy and so I provided another for her birthday,which we both enjoy. Got to have Dwight.
0	PERFECT
0	Love it!
0	Love,love, love this song.  First time I heard it I just knew I had to add it to my collection.
0	Very catchy. Was fun rediscovering this in Pitch Perfect 2.
0	In A Big Warehouse, as well as all 5 of the other Imagination Movers CDs, does not disappoint!  I can't remember the last time I listened to one of my "grownup" cds in the car...my daughter Raz and I are always rocking out to the Movers instead!  Their music is fun and educational with a positive message in each song.  All of their CDs, as well as their live performance have incredible amounts of energy!  I will be buying several more copies of this CD as prizes for my daughter's birthday party, and gifts for her schools and for her friends!
0	This CD is made up of 5 tunes that sound like a Ballad that has rock features.  That is what makes this CD so unique, the use of instruments as a background for the Voice. The words tell a story about what Collin is trying to convey and you can really understand his point of view.  When a Musician can make his voice stand out against the instruments you have found a musician that can go places in the music business.  I urge all of the people that read this review to buy his CD online you will not regret purchasing it.  The words are like a balm in a bad day and the music is snappy enough to make you feel you must dance.  I really enjoyed listening to the CD and Hope all of you will enjoy listening to it as well.
0	Awesome
0	Wow! Great comeback album for Queensryche. A must have for old-school 80's metal fans, and new fans alike.
0	Who doesn't get Happy listening to this song???
0	Very moving full of emotion and so true. I highly recommend this song.
0	Love it!
0	Love this Music.
0	My father in law was looking for this CD everywhere and couldn't find it. Ordered it here and got it within a few days. He was very surprised and happy...I was happy about the great price!
0	I met them in 1993 and recently saw them perform at house concert outside Chico California, and another in a boathouse in Oakland California. Worth any price to see but they perform for $20 a head at potluck home concerts, I own EVERYTHING they ever put out except a CD called Here Come The City Folk and have bought ang given away DOZENS of their first 2 releases and 4 of their last couple. I highly recommend Alisa Freeman and Kimball Hurd Have Faith CD and everything Kieth has done. Roger recently closed his Itallian resturant on University Ave Berkley, CA after Hurricane Sandy threatened his parents welfare (what a man!). Kimball is still as good as ever and did a song called 90 weight brew that is so me (my morning coffee), Keith and his lovely wife are still improving the world with their presence in Santa Cruz area CA.
0	All I really wanted to do was rate it 5 stars, but i'm required to type something in order for me to rate the song.
0	It is a song that I wish was never made, but necessary to pay tribute to Paul Walker.
0	My favorite song from this movie--love Dylan and Cash together.
0	Ahhhh! This is when music was music, those songs straight from the hart and a staple for Sunday cruzing... A must own if your into classics. Thanks again Mary for these wonderful jams
0	It was a gift appreciated.
0	Love Slayer, added to my collection with Hell Awaits. A great classic from the early days of Slayer. Original thrash.
0	After their celebratory 2004 folk entrancement debut EP 'Through The Sun Door', White Magic has evidently turned out to be a one-woman show headed by keyboardist/singer Mira Billote who ,only a few years ago, co-fronted Quix*O*Tic with her sister. While the original White Magic lineup of drummer Miggy Littleton (who has returned to Blood On The Wall) and guitarist Andy McCleod are out to lunch, it is obvious to hear that Billote was the member who steered the Magic's creative wheel and soaked the group's sound with her unmistakeable Grace Slick-meets-Roma-stoytelling-voice.  Much of the music on 'Dat Rosa Mel Apibus' take from the songs "One Note" and "Gypsies Came Marching After" found on the 'Through The Sun Door'EP. The sound of those two songs nearly sculpt, track-by-track, Billote's latest effort as one complete musical thought. Her voice and keyboard style rivet all of the songs and her new collaborators on drums and guitar are more subdued in their playing.  'Through The Sun Door' is far more diverse, although it leaves the feeling of wanting more. 'Dat Rosa Mel Apibus' is a satisfying follow up but songs like "Plain Gold Ring", "Wolves", and "Apocalypse" from thier debut are uncharted and possibly forgotten territories.  4 stars.  p.s. The album cover is one of the best in history. Seriously. See the vinyl version for it's full effect.
0	Danceable.
0	Ran across this via YouTube where it was combined with scenes from the movies to make a great collage.  Song fun just on its own as well.
0	Great
0	Tamela is an awesomely anointed singer.  This song always blesses me.  So proud of the work Tamela has done as an independent artist.
0	I bought this album the day it was released. I've been constantly listening to Red ever since and I haven't gotten tired of listening to it yet.  Red was one of my favorite albums of 2012, and "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" was my second favorite song of 2012 (behind Gotye's song, "Somebody That I Used to Know").  It's one of the few whole albums that I have on my MP3 player.  What I like about Taylor Swift is that she has grown as an artist with each album.  Sure, Red is more pop than country, and that's not a bad thing.  The songs that I like the most are the pop songs.  My favorite songs:  "State of Grace" - An upbeat song, great way to start the album. "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" - This is my favorite song on the album! "I Knew You Were Trouble." The title track, "Red" "The Lucky One" "Holy Ground" "Stay Stay Stay" - I love to hear Taylor's laugh at the end of the song, that tells me that she had fun recording it! "I Almost Do" "All Too Well" "22" "Begin Again" - A nice ballad that closes the album.
0	Excellent vocals
0	Love this music,  takes me back to a happy place..
0	I love Rick Springfield!  this is an excellent CD. Songs are catchy and relevant. One of Rick's best CDs since the '80s.
0	I heard a sample of "This Is The Life" by My Name Is Kay on a Youtube Video for Step Up Revolution soundtrack and had to hear the rest of the song. I was not disappointed. Very good track.
0	For a new song this is great. It's has great lyrics and a great beat. I really enjoy listening to it
0	If you love incredible music and the most pleasant surprises you have found it. These guys are bad men in the best sense.  Down to earth, unpretentious, and very gifted musicians.  Finland Rocks..
0	I will be honest with you, Bad Religion is my all-time favorite band and truly can do no wrong in my mind.  Therefore, it is no surprise that I give this album 5 stars.  It is just as good as I anticipated, and maybe better.  However, I can see how some closed-minded people could be disillusioned by it.  And by that I mean people who can't stand to see a band broaden their musical horizon a bit.  Every song on here has the unmistakable, distinct Bad Religion feel, but there are a couple tracks (Cyanide, I Won't Say Anything) that is as slow as the band has ever been.  For me, this isn't a problem.  For people who want nothing but lightning fast punk rock, this might be a problem.  For me, as long as Graffin is singing a good tune and the album has a nice mixture of fast and slow, I will be a happy happy man.  Now don't get me wrong: while this is their slowest album since The New America or Recipe for Hate, there are a couple of blistering tracks: The Day The Earth Stalled shows the band in their usual fast, aggressive style.  Only Rain is very memorable and grows on you like a fungus (in a good way).  The Resist Stance starts off with an Iron Maiden-like riff and then becomes one of the faster songs on the album.  Besides the aforementioned slower tracks, this whole album carries a solid pace: not unusually fast or slow.  Absolutely not boring in the least. As far as the lyrics go, there are less multi-syllabic words, and in general is more accessible, but this doesn't make them any weaker.  There are still a lot of thought-provoking tracks, while not as overtly political as a few of their past efforts. Graffin's voice is sounding better than ever, the musicianship is great, and the production is slicker than on New Maps of Hell.  Graffin's voice isn't buried as deep in the mix.  I really can't imagine people disliking this album, but it is a fairly vast departure from New Maps of Hell, a more old-school inspired album as reminiscent of their 80's albums as any of their newer ones get.  Let's face it: if you're a true Bad Religion fan, you should love this album.  If you like only angry, dirty punk rock, some of this album may bother you.  I can definitely see this album getting more radio play than most of their other albums, and they deserve it.  Long live Bad Religion...30 more years!
0	If you like Tracy Byrd you will like this album. It. was worth the money. Get it as an MP3 album then you can play it on any mobile device.
0	nice lyrics and great tune
0	I love it we jam out to it all the time
0	Awsome
0	Great song
0	This is another example of David Arnold's outstanding scoring for CASINO ROYALE. "Bond Wins It All" is simply brilliant. With CASINO ROYALE a very dynamic, moving and atmospheric score is realized thanks to David Arnold's definitive Bond scoring. In the film it is immediately clear. David Arnold gives us a low key Bond score and a daring soundtrack at that is simply amazing. This soundtrack is outstanding and "Bond Wins It All" is one of the best cuts from the soundtrack CD album.
0	Very cool song!!
0	Acker Bilk plays the most relaxing music. If you have a hectic life and need some downtime, this is just what the doctor ordered.
0	Ride is an incredibly and wonderfully produced anthemic song from the lovely Lana Del Rey. It's one of those songs that grows on you each time you here it. It makes for a great listen in your car!
0	WHO DOESN'T LOVE ED SHEERAN?  CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE.
0	Just a solid reimagining of a famous rap song. It is something you can rock out to in your car.
0	I have a few of their songs and like them!
0	Such a great sound. first heard gotye after he won the grammy for this song. great break up song haha
0	I've enjoyed any n all of Mz Griffin's music. She's a elegant songstress! !!!  The album is soothing.
0	memories
0	Back to their roots. Awesome CD worth every penny
0	Awesome Song! Love the Black Keys!
0	Anne Hathaway becomes Fantine in every way with her heartfelt vocals and passionate interpretation. She deserves every award she won for this role!
0	Always come back to this one particular song at Christmas.  Not particularly religious, but more to remember loved ones that are gone.  Still know where I was the first time I heard it.  That's the test of a memorable song for me.
0	North Las Vegas, the hometown that is the subject of Shamir's brilliant debut LP, has pretty much been Recession Town USA over the last eight or so years. During the nadir of the downturn, the place teemed with boarded-up windows, casual criminality, and overgrown, tumbleweed-strewn lawns. The fragrance of broken dreams wafted through the desert air. In the distance you could see the skyscrapers that had been started before the economic crash but abandoned when funding dried up.  Bryce Harper has worked that same working-class Vegas grit to wunderkind status in baseball. In "Ratchet," Shamir polishes that grit into precious, flashing jewelry, and achieves wunderkind status of his own. The production and songwriting here are top-notch, but what really makes this record memorable is Shamir himself, who spouts charisma like the fountains at the Bellagio spout neon-highlighted water.  This album is introspective, but it's not depressing at all. It's as if the heartache and desperation are taken for granted here, so there's no need to discuss them. Instead, the focus is on clubbing, teenage romance, and dreams. It strikes me as a major contribution to queer culture circa 2015, but the genre-bending of the music is even more attention-grabbing than the gender-bending of Shamir's otherworldly voice. A series of album-art slogans includes the aphorism "Genre is a tool, not a boundary." The songwriting and production transcend genre. Prince is the stylistic touchstone here -- R & B and rock and pop and dance all melt together in a pool of artistic, sexually-charged brilliance.  Lead single "On the Regular" is a classic piece of psychedelic cotton candy, but we get surprising, subtle variations on that aesthetic through the record. "Make a Scene" feels genuinely liberating and will no doubt be fodder for neighbors complaining about late-night drunken singalongs. "In for the Kill" successfully marries jazzy 90s rap horns to New Jack Swing. The whole album, in fact, could be characterized as New Jack Swing with contemporary, post-Yeezus synthesizer settings. The keyboards sounds and desperate romanticism also remind me of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' "It's Blitz" LP. "Call It Off" is a technicolor disco tune featuring the kind of rapping rarely heard outside of double-dutch jump rope sessions. "Darker" finds Shamir sounding like a devastated Whitney Houston. In the show-stopper bonus track, he belts out heartbreak accompanied only by an acoustic guitar, sounding like Nina Simone in an after-hours honky tonk.  When Shamir's "Northtown" EP came out a couple of years ago, it was obvious that the then-teenager had talent. "Ratchet" explodes that talent into casino-level neon. In "Head in the Clouds," he insists "Just wanna be great/Is that such a crime?" before bursting into a Cut Copy-worthy dancefloor meltdown of synthesizers and melody. What is almost criminal is how great Shamir already is, even though he seems to have an endless reservoir of potential. A deep reservoir in the desert.
0	In listening to The Ossipov Orchestra preform you truly appreciate what a unique instrument the Balalaika is and the many rich and glorious sounds it is capable of producing.
0	I stumbled over Kaizers Orchestra a long time ago.  I was completely hooked after hearing Bak et Hallelujah just once.  A few years back, I bought this album more or less on a whim, and I still consider it one of the best purchases I've ever made.  The songs are great without even having to understand the lyrics, but once I learned the meanings behind some of the songs, they only became more profound. If you like Kaizers Orchestra even a little, just buy this.  Quickly.
0	This song version is awesome. I saw the play, and fell in love with this song. It moved me to tears, and I wanted to find it sung like I had heard it.  I listened to many versions of this awesome song, but each one failed me. When I heard this version, the singer had nailed it; I was very happy.  First time listeners: check this out. For those who like this song: listen to this beautiful version; it will move you.
0	I love this music. It does remind me of my childhood.
0	This band has a great sound & this is a very unique, fun Christmas song.  Love the stringed instruments & old "big band" feel.
0	Great gift for good friend...
0	how can you not sing to this?
0	Excellent
0	Amazing.  Gives me chills.
0	Great
0	Best live show of the Outlaws available
0	Bought this because Amazon has the best prices. I did not want to purchase the entire disk just certain songs so this worked out for me.
0	Great!
0	I was upgrading my cassette collection when I came across a cassette of 2nu's first album. "Ponderous" was the single that became a hit back then, and I remember it well. As I was looking to replace the cassette with a CD or MP3 album, I discovered this Best-of collection of 2nuincluding songs from their second album that I wasn't aware of. It contains most of the songs I enjoyed from the first album along with a few tracks from the second album. Perfect solution for me!  2nu mixes instrumental music with a spoken narrative and supporting sound effects that often tells a story. The beats can be infectious and the stories often have a comedic touch. It's definitely unique. My favorite tracks include "Ponderous", "Her Name", "Spaz Attack", and Count 'em up Queek".
0	great!
0	So, I am an adult Jonas fan. I was led to the sibling trio by my daughter back in 2007. I have waited over 3 years for new original music from them and here it is. It was worth the wait. PomPoms is infectious, catchy and so full of innuendo I almost can't help laughing aloud. Try to get the hook out of your head. Good luck. It is an earworm of the best kind. The song is written by the brothers, Nick, Kevin, and Joe, along with Paul E. Phamous. The brothers play the instruments you hear and 20-year old musical phenom, Nick, produces the song. Not too shabby for 3 former Disney darlings. The boys are now men; their music is maturing and I believe we haven't scratched the surface of their talent yet. I am so looking forward to the rest of this album.
0	This is a great piece for falling asleep, relaxing, meditation or massage to as it really puts you in a relaxed state. My massage clients like this piece and often become so relaxed that they fall asleep.
0	Has a small crack in it, but it plays just fine. :)
0	This life is such a catchy song.  I just love it. It is a great theme song the the TV show.
0	Classic song, can find anything on Amazon and this is the best way to buy music with the flexibility of the .mp3 format.

0	LOVE this song. So happy I heard it and then downloaded it. Eric Church never disappoints!
0	I have always thought that this is one of the best songs on the Vietnam era. I am pleased that I down loaded it from Amazon.
0	Great coo, funky, bass-heavy, grooving and skanking tune. Heard this on internet radio and rushed to buy it. A must have thumping lik'a reggae. The First Family of Reggae continue to spread the Word of Bob.  Jah Blessings 'pon you.
0	Great band when they had the lead singer.
0	Sarah Brightman's voice, showmanship and polished songs are evident in this Cd. This is her Greatest Hits amd it is worth listening to...Brightman will take you to Eden...then to space.....then to a land far away with her voice.
0	Wonderful song!
0	Love!
0	Their voices blend so well, and you get lost in this song.  Just another wonderful duet.
0	This song has long been a favorite of mine and was played at my wedding in 1982. The marriage ended in 2008 but this song is eternal. Beautifully done my Noel Paul Stookey.
0	The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were all the rage for a few years when I was a kid in the 1980s, although to be fair I didn't know they were ninjas until quite some time later, thanks to the busybody interference of the self-appointed guardian of Britains national morals, Mary Whitehouse, who decided that showing children scenes of ninjas doing things with nunchaku would contribute to the decline of a generation. To me they will always be the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, and no-one can tell me otherwise, although looking back I now realize I never was entirely sure how Michelangelo defeated his foes with nothing more dangerous than a slice of pizza. This has been an astonishingly long-lived franchise  with the world having already been exposed to three separate animated TV series, a Japanese anime, a live-action TV series, we are now on our fifth movie based on the characters originally created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984, following the original three movies in 1990, 1991 and 1993, and the 2007 CGI flop TMNT. This latest installment is essentially an origin story reboot of the entire story, stars Megan Fox and Will Arnett, and is directed by Jonathan Liebesman.  The music of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films doesnt have the most distinguished history; Monty Python music maestro John Du Prez scored the first three films, but very little of his music saw the light of day on CD, and Klaus Badelt wrote a decent but little-remembered action score for TMNT in 2007. Enter Brian Tyler; having become Marvels go-to guy for music, with the scores for Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World already under his belt, and the score for Avengers: Age of Ultron yet to come, Tyler looks set to challenge Hans Zimmer for the title of King of All Super-Heroes, and his score for the Turtles continues the trend of him writing strong, powerful, thematic orchestral scores in the grandest symphonic traditions.  Brian Tyler has been writing wonderful music for Jonathan Liebesmans films for over a decade, ever since he scored the directors feature debut, Darkness Falls, in 2003, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continues the trend. Anyone who has listened to a Brian Tyler action score in the last four or five years will know exactly what to expect: a large orchestra, a large choir, a strong main theme, lots of complicated action writing, and a sense of scale and volume that few composers can match these days. The main theme, first heard in the opening cue Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and reprised fully in the conclusive TMNT March, is a belter: brass-heavy, powerful, heroic, and often accompanied by a soaring choir. It has a few superficial similarities to his themes from both Thor: The Dark World and Iron Man 3, but on the whole this is immaterial. Tyler is pretty much the only guy writing memorable, recurring themes for super hero movies these days, and we need to be thankful for that fact alone.  The action music, by and large, is fast, dense, and lots of fun. Cues like the astonishing Splinter vs. Shredder, Turtles United, Shellacked, Shortcut, Cowabunga, and the enormously exciting Adrenaline are barnstormers. Most of them feature strong performances of the main theme, and all are embellished by flamboyant touches in the string phrasing, the brass countermelodies, and in the percussion patterns that underpin everything. Splinter vs. Shredder and Shortcut are especially noteworthy, with their chanted choral parts, back-and-forth brass writing, furiously slashing string runs, complicated rhythmic elements, and general sense of epic grandeur. For the most part, the electronic elements of the score are kept to a bare minimum, simply doubling the percussion or adding a secondary level of bubbling bass. Its unobtrusive, but maintains a level of coolness for contemporary audiences.  By way of comparison, some of the brass triplets remind me a little of James Horners most recent action music, especially scores such as Avatar and The Amazing Spider-Man, while some of horn/flute trills recall Michael Giacchinos Star Trek music. Similarly, the penultimate cue Buck Buck has a touch of the best parts of Hans Zimmers Man of Steel about it; to be clear, all of these things are good things.  To hint at the Oriental origins of the quartet, Tyler peppers his music with an occasional taste of the land of the rising sun, with trilling Japanese bamboo flutes and immense taiko drums underpinning several tracks. Cues such as the aforementioned Splinter vs. Shredder, Origins and Shredder play up this aspect of the score, and give it a different flavor than some of its contemporaries that is very appealing.  If Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a downside, its its total and utter lack of subtlety. Im not saying that a comic book film about crime fighting amphibians requires the restraint and sensitivity that a more grounded movie needs  things need to be larger-than-life  but Tyler scores almost every scene in the film with apocalyptic bombast, as though every moment is the most important moment of the story, and by the end of the 70-minute album I can anticipate some listeners will find the whole thing a little overwhelming. Theres very little sense of anticipation, build-up and catharsis; the score whangs you over the head from the first moment of the first cue, and continues whanging you over the head virtually the entire time until its all over.  As such, there only a few moments of downtime. Adolescent Genetically Altered Shinobi Terrapins has some soothing choral work, an intimate piano element, and a mystery-shrouded little cello figure reminiscent of Tia Dalmas theme from the third Pirates of the Caribbean film. Later, Origins features some lovely harp glissandi, Brotherhood features an emotional string-and-choir theme that is quite exquisite, and Rise of the Four revisits the emotional choral panache heard during the opening moments of the first cue, before segueing into yet another rousing performance of the main theme. Finally, at the very end of Buck Buck a soothing electronic guitar element comes to take center stage, providing a sentimental, but defiantly contemporary coda to all the chaos.  Having covered those caveats, I have to say that in terms of sheer entertainment value, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is one of the most enjoyable scores of 2014 for me so far. Unpretentious scores which kick ass while wearing their hearts on their sleeves are hard to come by these days; too many scores, especially in the super hero genre, have begun take themselves far too seriously, eschewing escapist entertainment in favor of tortured, dark tales of retribution and twisted morality. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the antidote to all that, but being unpretentious and entertaining doesnt mean sacrificing musical creativity or compositional dexterity, which Tyler once again proves he has in spades.
0	Never a bad Kenny album! Always wind up giving mine away and have to replace.
0	great song from a great band that will no doubt turn out many more terrific songs in the future.  So far 'Demons' is my favorite song from this group.
0	I used this song as part of a subliminal recording for myself.  First you have a white noise track (I chose Joe Baker's Womb Sounds) and then you speak your affirmations and then you add music to mask it so only the subconscious hears it.  This was the music I used for one of my recordings.  I wanted something that was pleasant to listen to but varied and intricate enough that I would not tire quickly of it (since I need to listen to these daily for some time for greatest effect).  This totally filled the bill.  I made several different recordings and found myself gravitating to Steven Cravis' works over and over (I wanted different music for each genre of subliminal).  I am a true fan of his music for relaxing, meditating, etc.
0	Rachel Platten ROCKS!

0	I can't even tell you how nice it felt to hear that voice again.  I hadn't even noticed she'd released a new album.  As soon as I saw she had, I bought it, and have subsequently been on a Cindy Lee jag-- listening to all of her work.  This is a small collection of great CLB songs.  The stuff is fresh-- in Cindy style, she's definitely trying new things.  My favorite songs are "Cry Me a Jordan," "Beloved Stranger" and "Feel Like I Owe Somebody Something."  "When Did Jesus Become a Republican" takes you by surprise, but it's a great song and does a nice job of asking a question that nobody seems to be able to answer.  A very nice addition to the Cindy Lee collection, all of which are fantastic.  I sincerely hope that this is a sign of more Cindy CD's.  She's vastly underrated, and so talented. I've seen her perform many times, and I know that there are so many Cindy jewels out there, I'd love to hear some of those songs again some day.
0	Enjoyed immensely. Haven't been really into death metal for a long time, but this caught me with its intensity and energy.
0	Different sound.  Great to have something different to list to.  GREAT tune!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Great song. Reminds me of my daughter
0	I love this song!!
0	Best cast album since Les Miserable. Amazing!
0	Perfect
0	loved it!
0	Jeff Tweedy continues to shine as a songwriter, singer, and stylist. Good stuff!
0	Very good but Baby Washington's version is still the best
0	Great. A definite step forward by Massive Attack. Dark but not scary, gloomy but enlightening, very relaxing, perfect at nights. It helps to feel the true essence of the world, the thinnest net of unvisible silk threads  that hold things around us together, the mechanism that provides space for  both the routine and miracle.
0	Love love love
0	Ok, Mr Buble, make me melt again.
0	And this new recording brings them back with all the memories from yesteryear. If you like vocal harmony and good melody, then The Association will rock your boat. Back to a time when life and music was much simpler, and somehow better for it.
0	Parfait merci!
0	I bought this for my wife, and she enjoyed it very much.
0	Wonderfull.
0	love this
0	great party song
0	from broadway to the r&b scene heathers voice shows she's a real pro. One unique woman that offer a little something different with her style. Keep singing heather!
0	What can you say Stevie Wonder is just awesome with the instrumental talents that he has including lyrics, composition, style, and forecast.
0	this is a Beatiful HEBREW Lullaby sung with a family gifted with the voice to sing. Shalom it will Bless you greatly, plus the music is nice too.
0	Not as good as Justin beiber BUT he can play guitar ALMOST as good as John Mayer? LOL!! Seriously - we are talking about HENDRIX here!! Slap me around and show some respect for a God!! Recorded just after the Axis album and while recordings were in progress for Electric ladyland, this set is arguably Hendrix's finest, certainly his most visceral IMHO. All the songs are from his first album (no Axis here). Too bad. I understand he was to play an additional set later (which was rained out) and that could have included some Axis songs.  The sound quality is excellent and the band just cooks!! One request - compare the sheer mastery of totally original free form  playing here with recent "studied" recordings by the likes of Joe Bonamassa and others. it is like comparing a baroque orchestra playing J.S. bach with a modern "authentic instruments' academic exercise. Hendrix is the real deal - a genius who created his own style and reinvented the way an instrument is played. 1000 years from now, Hendrix will live on. However, Mr. Beiber, Mayer and, also, Mr. Bonamassa? Creative artists and entertainers they might be. But....there was and only will be, one Hendrix. This recording captures HENDRIX at his very best during his period of most creativity. But the CD AND the DVD/Bluray. I did.
0	This is funny, funny stuff. In fact, the stand-up itself if probably 5-star material, but the skits in between are hit or miss. His bit about 1-star people (white trash, ghetto, whatever you like) is uproarious and accurate. He also pegs the conflicted feelings many of us have about eating too much junk food at the wrong time, and feeling the shame but eating it anyway. Terrific suburban comic.
0	As expected.
0	I love this song.  It is perfect for the times  when you have done all that you can and don't know what else to do.
0	I love this bands many songs.  This one is dear to me, makes you wonder what the person on the other side of the bed is really thinking.
0	I've been a little slow on getting to listen to this group.  And I am in love.  I can't wait until the come back to the east coast/USA
0	This is one of the best albums in the history of music.  Not just metal, ALL music.  From the comparably light classic guitar intro to Fight Fire with Fire to the grandiose drum crashing end to Call of Ktulu, this album  shows Metallica's full range of musical composition, speed guitaring,  growling lyrical genius, and an impressive array of concepts.  The title  track is a fast and aggressive look at an electric-chair execution,  complete with the plaintive moans of 'I don't want to die'.  For Whom the  Bell Tolls shares billing with One (of the later released Justice album) as  Metallica's best song, and moves you from its opening of Church bells to  the drum solo at the end.  Fade to Black, a  slower and more soulful song  about suicide and depression, is one of the band's best, and shows Kirk's  full guitar ability.  Trapped Under Ice and Escape are comparatively weak,  but are still solid metal songs, if not good ones that are merely under  rated.  Creeping Death however, is amazing.  Taken from the Hebrew story  about the final plague in Egypt, its pure adrenaline pumping sound has made  it a crowd favorite for years.  The die die chant between the 2nd and final  verses truly makes the blood flow.  The album closes with a powerful and  intriguing instrumental, The Call of Ktulu.  Many don't give this song its  due for its complexity and the adrenaline rush it can give as it shifts  gears from a low octane opening, to a speedy heart, and ending in a series  of cymbol crashes and power cords.  All in all, worth buying for any price,  and a must own for any metal fan.
0	I downloaded this song on a whim and very glad I did. I kept hitting replay after hearing it the first time. A great addition to my alternative rock playlist.
0	This song right here is the best song I've heard in a long time  Got the kids singing it too
0	Been a fan of both Action Bronson and Harry Fraud for the past year and this EP certainly plays on their strengths. Bam Bam continues to drop rewind button worthy rhymes while Fraud laces the tracks with his trademark 90s influenced beats. Guest artists though few are very well placed and All 6 tracks are strong and have alot of replay value. My only real gripe is that it wasn't long enough. Aside from that I haven't stopped playing it yet. If you like one or both artists this is for you. You won't be disappointed.
0	Easy to locate - easy to download - and now available on my kindle fire any time I want to listen.
0	Released a few years after the First Set, 2nd Set is equally fine and a wonderful example of how the band sounded at that time. Warren Haynes gets a bit more of a showcase here and this is the only place you can find "the Same Thing" which is a very good number. If you love the Allman Brothers Band, this is a Must Own.
0	Artists all the time do remakes of some of the classics.  Sometimes they take on songs that shoes are too big to fill so to speak.  BUT in this instance Chris Brown did it justice and then some.
0	Super cool groove. I love listening to this song while driving. It always seems to help clear my mind. Buy it!
0	Excellent, song stands the test of time. Well written and performed. Perfect voice for this type of music. Still love this song since it first was released.
0	This oldie, is one of the ones I heard as child in the eighties and found it once more,a good uplifting song
0	Good music. Sounds great!
0	Amazing soundtrack!
0	Who doesn't like Beck? Come on man! This is good stuff. I made it one of my kids ring tone

0	Doyle Lawson newest album is one of his best.  Mr. Lawson has continued his tradition of great music with this new gospel CD.  I have enjoyed every song.  It is definitely worth your money.
0	This song is a great song about a small town with a great vocal arrangement! Great Lyrics and beautiful song.
0	Eric Church is my favorite newer country artist and it seems like anything Aldean or Bryan put out is a hit so it was pure genius for the 3 of them to get together! Love love love this song!! The kind of rockin country you crank up loud in the truck and sing along to!
0	I love this CD as it brings to mind the Scriptures.  I with there were more CD's like this one.  Fernando Ortega is truly a gem.  My personal favorite is "Sing to Jesus" which focuses on glorifying Jesus for his work on the cross.  I love the line "Sing to Jesus, Lord of our shame."
0	IT"S  AWESOME !!  BRINGS BACK SO MANY MEMORIES OF MY YOUNGER YEARS, WISH I COULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN !!

0	This is some down home heavy, parliament style funk of an extraordinary nature.  The beat is captivating and the drive intense. Listen, but do so standing up...because you will want to dance , dance and prance....
0	"Welcome to Our House" (WtOH) is the long-awaited result of Eminem's endorsement of the Slaughterhouse project back in 2009 when Crooked I, Joell Ortiz, Joe Budden, and Royce da 5'9 unexpectedly appeared behind him in the "Forever" music video. Eminem produced much of WtOH and mixed it as well, so it's no exaggeration to say that he is Slaughterhouse's fifth member.  WtOH is both lengthy and dense; few hip hop albums have 18 tracks of music and so few skits (only two), and even fewer deliver solid lyricism so consistently from beginning to end. This album is a like slice of chocolate cake so rich that you have to stop eating it midway, take a milk break, and then come back to complete. If you savor and appreciate each track, you probably won't be able to listen to the whole thing from beginning to end in one sitting.  The replay value of these 18 tracks is phenomenal. Each track is packed with funny/brilliant punchlines, complex rhyme schemes, meter changes, and a gamut of raw emotions - anger, elation, frustration, sorrow, fear - as the four MCs rhyme about fame corrupting their friendships, dealing with their kids and "crazy baby mamas," staying at the top of rap's lyrical pecking order, and escaping the street life thanks to hard work, talent, and lucky breaks (which they are cognizant and appreciative of).  WtOH is one of the few albums that merits a track-by-track review, but I'll stick to the standouts so as not to ruin the surprise and pleasure of discovering and experiencing the depth of each track for yourself. "Get Up" is probably the most motivating track and my personal favorite. Skylar Grey lends her trademark haunting and melancholy vocals to two of the album's somber, serious tracks, "Rescue Me" and "Our House." "Goodbye" is poignant, with Budden saying farewell to miscarried twins, Crooked rapping about losing the uncle who filled in for his deadbeat dad to cancer, and Ortiz rhyming about his grandmother passing away. The four MCs deal with their own humanity in the sad but somehow uplifting "The Other Side," where Royce confesses that if his wife died he'd want to die alone (unusual since rappers generally claim "bitches ain't shit" and pretend to be completely emotionally unattached to women) and Ortiz lays bare his problems with one of his baby mamas.  Underlying all of the tracks is a feeling of triumph, of total victory over all the haters and doubters (a doubter is just a hater who hasn't come out of the closet). I picked up on this triumphant feeling even before I heard Royce on the chorus of "Our Way" sing: "We made it / But we did it our way." For four MCs who have been in the rap game since the mid to late 1990s, WtOH is the pinnacle of their careers thus far, careers that have been an unending series of frustrating false starts, deals fallen through, and delayed/cancelled projects all of which bred cynicism among rap fans that the Slaughterhouse project would produce anything more than quality internet mixtapes given their individual career trajectories. WtOH proves that Slaughterhouse is much greater than the sum of its parts in this regard, and every track on this album is like the endzone dance of a football team that was never supposed to have a chance of getting into the Superbowl much less scoring touchdowns.  As good as WtOH is, it's not flawless. "Walk of Shame" and "Throw That" (featuring Eminem) are straight garbage, pure recycle bin material for anyone's computer. These two are also the album's most misogynistic, woman-hating tracks, so deleting them is a double pleasurable. Although Slaughterhouse managed to put some witty and clever lines on both tracks, it was a waste of talent.  The choruses for "Flip a Bird," "Throw it Away," and "Frat House" are lame/annoying but the four MCs' lyricism not only rescues them from the skip button but makes them enjoyable overall.  The last blemish on the otherwise flawless facade of WtOH is the identical structure of all the tracks. Each MC takes his turn on each beat, dropping 16 or 32 bars. This formula is rinsed and repeated 18 times (although Royce didn't have a verse on "Goodbye"); there is almost no interweaving between the four MCs a la Royce and Eminem on the Bad Meets Evil album. Ortiz and Budden trade bars back and forth with each other for a minute on "Frat House," but aside from that, each MC sticks to his own bloc of time. A related issue is that, while the four of them stick to a unifying theme for each track, not once do they craft a unified story over the course of their four verses. These four gave us "Three Sides to a Story," "Part of Me," "125 part 4," and "My Life 2.0," so it's clear that Slaughterhouse hasn't even begun to tap into their collective story-telling abilities. Maybe we'll see these elements in a more developed form on their next release.  These minor blemishes pale in comparison to what is a solid achievement by four rap titans who are finally getting their due.
0	i absolutely love this cd!  every single song sticks in your head!  lovelovelove it! it even makes this old woman want to dance
0	This is a great song, and it was very easy to download and put on my iPod touch. The sound and quality is excellent.
0	I've been following this duo since the eighties. If you like these genres of music, these two (and their bands) are wonderful, and still performing around the country. This Live In Holland CD is fantastic!
0	Light hearing with a heavy message. The clean acoustic guitar accompaniment sounds so calming. The electrifying voice of Misty Edwards vibrates your soul to tune in with the Holy Spirit in the messages of the songs. Try this new short album. It has a little flavor of Catholicism (in my personal opinion). This album is not as powerful as her previous albums. I'd love her to compile more of spontaneous worship sessions if possible.
0	Love it love it!
0	Makes you want to dance around with joy.
0	always loved they're music, and this sure brings back all the fun I had during that era of time, loved to dance!!!
0	Outstanding, bluish.
0	Let me start by saying that I feel this album is flawless, as an album.  However, we have known Gungor for bring modern twists to worship music for the church.  While I adore this album, and this album is worshipful for me personally, I feel like most of the album with be difficult to translate to a local church's worship service.  However, THIS ALBUM IS FLAWLESS!
0	Love this song and purchasing music from Amazon is so easy. Everyone should do this. Thank you.
0	Nirvana would go on to be huge international rock stars after the release of their second album "Nevermind", the album was much more pop oriented then their previous release "Bleach". Kurt Cobain had a knack for writing catchy pop tunes that would stick in the listener's head. This cannot be labeled a true grunge album along the lines of Mudhoney and the Melvins, but it's catchy and crossed over into the mainstream. "Nevermind" topped Garth Brooks, C&C Music factory, and Michael Jackson, which was big news back in 1991. A small punk band from Aberdeen became the biggest rock stars almost overnight, creating an almost unwanted fame that would ultimately be the demise of the band. If you are looking for a grunge album , you should pick up their last release "In Utero" which is much more raw.  "Nevermind" will stand the test of time because it's just a great rock record, plus it's catchy as hell.  All the hits were on this album, so buy and you want be disappointed.
0	If you are thinking about buying anything from Les, then you sure don't need my review. Les sings about liking his wine and taking matters into his own hands with an aluminum baseball bat. Completely San Francisco craziness. I saw Primus open for RHCP at the Boarding House many years ago... I had a hard time determining if they had started the show yet. I love these guys. Completely out of the box band.
0	I originally had this on cassette when I was in college in the early 1980's.  I have been looking for it since.  If you are a Harry Chapin fan this is the best of his live albums, no question.  A must buy!
0	Is is kind of  sexual vivid  and worldly, but it is still a nice song
0	Love it! The whole album is great!
0	The Londonderry Choir does an excellent job of singing this timeless hymn.  Without accompaniment from any musical instrument, the choir's clear voices convey every syllable with peace and four-part harmony.  I could listen to this beautiful rendition many times each day.  God's peace settles into my spirit every time I hear it.
0	wonderful
0	See: Lodger.tv  Lodger is a Finnish indie rock band, formed by Teemu Meril in 2002. Although largely unknown outside of Finland, they have established a cult-following on the internet due to the popularity of their flash music videos.  And they rock.
0	Very beautiful and powerful song used by many great movies This song should be part of any great music collection.
0	Beautiful music.  I really enjoy it while I'm working in the office.
0	Tasty jazz flavoured uber surf-guitar covers of classic 60's tunes.
0	This is the best, easiest, and least expensive way to take an oceanside mini-vacation. Just close your eyes and relax to the sounds of rolling surf that continue for an hour. Depending on your speakers/headphones/earbuds/equalizer settings, you may also hear foghorns, a few gulls, and a buoy bell in the background. Set it on repeat for a great night's sleep. Highly recommended!
0	SCC is always good and ministers to my music-loving heart.
0	Sounds old school the way his mike sounds I like it. The chorus is really catchy and the words are a good pick up line for girls who are down and blue.
0	What can I say, I love Amy's voice and then to hear this version of "To Know Him Is To Love Him" was great.
0	Classic and sounds like its been remastered. Love it
0	I love this song, every since she sang it on the Grammy Awards, I couldn't get this song outta my head.
0	John Sebastian (born John Benson Sebastian, March 17, 1944) "is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist and autoharpist." (Wikipedia) John was even a founder of The Lovin' Spoonful--impressive! I have always liked his catchy song "Welcome Back" which was the themes song to the television show "Welcome Back, Kotter" and in fact all of his music is really pretty special. True, this track set is a rather brief sampling of John's artistry but it makes a good introduction to John Sebastian for anyone just discovering his talent. Of course, if any fans are missing a track or two they can download them here; the sound quality is very good, too.  As I mentioned above, "Welcome Back" is an excellent song by John Sebastian himself; it topped the Billboard Top 100 chart and the Easy Listening chart--it even charted at 93 on the Country music chart! "She's a Lady" from John Sebastian's 1968 debut album (entitled "John B. Sebastian") gets a fine treatment from John who delivers his own ballad with great sensitivity; "You're a Big Boy Now" also comes from John's debut album and it has a great sound to it; it's very easy on the ear and it all holds its own very well. "Well, Well, Well" from John's 1971 album "The Four Of Us" shows just how well John could take a gospel music from the 1920s and make it into unforgettable classic rock; and the track set ends with John Sebastian performing the poignant "Stories We Could Tell" with a country feel to it that shows just how versatile John Sebastian is.  John Sebastian has shared so much of his talent with us and that's terrific. As I write this John will be touring from late April to November of 2013; catch him live in concert if you can! I highly recommend his music.
0	ok
0	Master singer and a very good looking man.  From my neck of the woods.
0	I love this album!
0	Awesome. If you're a bellydancer or Middle Eastern drummer, definitely buy this CD. You will love these classic rhythms and innovative  interpretations. "Nevik" is a percussive genius and knows how to blend Medieval, Middle Eastern, and Western rock rhythms seamlessly and with a big punch. I know whereof I speak because I've been in the bellydance business for over 10 years, and have seen few equal his intensity and spot-on timing. I heard him play live and had the privelege to jam with him once at Pennsic (I was the zill girl with the "mad rhythms" at Casa Bardicci :) and became an instant fan. Can't say enough good things... except to repeat, buy the disc!
0	Simply love the collection. Adele sings from the heart with such a gift and passion. I just purchased this album with only hearing one song and because I was sure Adele would deliver a beautiful piece of her.
0	Sounded great!
0	Very relaxing and melodic, with a wonderful karmic rhythm. Singing is intoxicating. Great CDrecommend it highly for easy listening AND some awesome background beach-y music..
0	Love this song
0	One of the good oldies of my Dj days
0	His last album MICHAEL had maybe 3 really good songs and there was speculation that some of the songs weren't even song by him. However, this song from the 80's being released now had that "good feeling" beat combined with original lyrics, makes the song addictive. Great song and I'm hoping the rest of this album is just as good. Beats pretty much any mainstream music out today.
0	Purchased as a gift - the receiver's response was "listened to it full blast LOUD and loved it - just as I remembered"
0	This disc has been one of my favorite discs from the DISCO era. The music pumps with the German beat and the message is all about love. I used to laugh at my parents when they spoke of the songs they grew up with. Now being grown up I look back at the songs I grew up with and I understand. Just one of those disco nuggets that will play forever more-Amen.
0	This album is so great. I just found out about this artist tonight. I love her vibe and vocals. The beats are great..the vocals are great. I"m so glad i got the album.
0	Great download quality!
0	Years before this album, Percy Faith was one of the true kings of instrumental pop music, especially with his Latin-flavored signature style, and admirers of his most classic works are likely to put off by this album just by seeing "disco" and "Percy Faith" in the same sentence (anybody remember Pat Boone and his heavy metal)?  Truth be told, nothing on this album (which was made just a year before Faith's death) is as richly beautiful as "Theme From A Summer Place" or "Delicado," but anyone who thinks that it's an album full of generic dance music made to cash in on the disco craze will be surprised. There is no singing, and all of the songs are solid, well-arranged, and have that rich, orchestral aura to them that Percy Faith is best known for.
0	Great new album from MM!  Have been waiting for it for years!
0	daughter loves
0	My favorite Snatam Kaur CD. I never tire of it.
0	This CD is a very good follow up to his first album "Worshiper's Cry". Very beautiful concept to bring all sounds of Africa together into one collection. From Ghana, Nigeria, Congo, and South Africa, it includes songs of praise and worship that will bless anyone with a heart to truly listen or sing while listening for the Glory of God. 2 thumbs and another thumb up for this one Sonnie ;)
0	Also, excellent jazz material.
0	Old fashion sound. Love it.
0	One word, just three little letters: WOW! I admit that I am an avid Sam fan, so when he came out with this new song of course I immediately gave it a listen. And "WOW!" is what it comes down to. This song just completely blew me away. It instantly became pretty much my favorite song of all time. No joke. No exaggeration. The lyrics, the  vocals, the music, everything about this song is just perfect, and it could not have come together any better. It's catchy, it's powerful, it's beautiful, it's breath-taking, it's REAL. It just doesn't get much better than this. I say this as a Sam fan, yes, but more importantly I say this as a person who enjoys music and love and life: you CANNOT go wrong with buying & listening to this song!!  But let's back up a little, shall we? Not having been alive enough years in 1984 (I was only 3!) to have seen Sam Harris' emergence into stardom with his incredible rendition of Over the Rainbow on Star Search, I only discovered his talent around a year ago. I had heard his voice before that, though:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Grease-The-New-Broadway-Cast-Recording-1994-Revival/dp/B000003FRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Grease - The New Broadway Cast Recording (1994 Revival)</a>&nbsp;- Those Magic Changes. That is the only version of the song I will listen to, it is FAB.U.LOUS! So as it happened, I didn't have the CD on me so I was nosing around YouTube and discovered a video of the song which was sung exactly like that recording! I took note of the name: Sam Harris (as an aside, I saw a comment left on his YouTube of someone telling him he made it impossible for anyone else to sing that song. I wholeheartedly agree!!).  Since learning his identity I have been hooked on Sam. He's an wonderful person, who happens to be one of the most incredibly talented singer/songwriters EVER!! His voice is a force to be reckoned with! I have trouble believing that anyone who starts looking into Sam can help loving him, he's not only talented but intelligent, articulate, kind, loving, hilarious, and oh and it doesn't hurt a thing that he's also gorgeous! ;) So go ahead, buy this song, love it, love him, and then go buying up all his other stuff. You'll want to, trust me!
0	This song grew on me.  Liked the simplicity, affection and respect that it shows his feelings toward his lady from beginning to end.
0	I heard the song,  and had to have it.
0	I bought this CD just for the Chordettes' "Mr. Sandman."  Lots of fond memories associated with that song.  And I discovered that ALL the songs on this CD are good. Of course, you'd have to like the music of the 50s to appreciate them. They sure don't write 'em (or sing 'em) like that anymore.
0	memories of house party.
0	Yeeeeeaaaaaahhhhh!
0	I enjoy using the song as a ring tone pn my phone and listening to it while at the gym or on the go.
0	Marlene is INCREDIBLE!  It was a joy to hear the two CDs with such wonderful repertoires. All the songs and arias are performed exquisitely.
0	I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this song! This has been my all time favorite since I was a young adult. My mother introduced me to it many years ago and I still believe it has the most beautiful meaning about family!
0	I have always loved Alabama's music,  but this is the best of all.
0	This is a great album. I can't wait to see you in Seattle. Thank you Johnny Marr, Buy this album now, wish it was auto-rip
0	Beautiful
0	Love her voice
0	Great song
0	Awesome song
0	Beautiful song
0	I THOUGHT OF NUMBERS, an early EP by Cut Copy, shows them before their full 80s revival, although "Glittering Clouds" shines like a bright coin. But "Rendezvous" really gets into the groove, with a perky synth line and shooting lasers. There's a touch of funk to "Live" and "Drop The Bomb," and the strings on "Standing Up Sitting Down" add a jaunty touch before "Endlessly" takes the EP out on a quiet note. Some fun tracks here.
0	I love all the cast from Glee, they are all great singers, awesome. They are all great. I  listen to their music all the time
0	I have been a long time fan of Ne-Yo and have been monitoring music sites for the release of his latest digital album. With three hits burning the charts, this album is a fantastic culmination of what I think it means to be the present Prince of R&B. IMHO, Ne-Yo is a genius musician and composer with hits like "Beautiful Monster", "Champagne Life", and "One In A Million". What I enjoy with his work is the fact that he shows a great deal of versatility in his type of music, so there's a variety of beatz ranging from your pure R&B to R&B/Pop. Additionally, this deluxe edition is available at a great price compared to other music sites. This package includes 3 extended versions of the videos that were recently released + a digital booklet that is set up like a comic book. Ne-Yo aka SFNR (Sexy For No Reason) Rocks!
0	I love this song as it has special meaning for me. As it probably does for anyone who has ever been there and 'Get's It.'
0	As advertised
0	Not typically a fan of Lana Del Rey's music, but she has a great voice and this is a wonderfully dark take on the song. I only wish it was longer.
0	Classic song
0	Awesome CD.....Love it...
0	It's AMAZING, I can't stop listening to it.
0	I don't understand any of the words but listen to this great song over and over and over - great voice and music !
0	Brings back good memories.
0	Suo Gan is a very moving piece of music that causes immediate recall of the movie and tugs at your heart.  John Williams is one of the greatest composers of movie music ever.
0	Nice beats.
0	I love this, it has a nice pretty up tempo beat, makes me want to dance all pretty... overall a nice song to dance to.
0	I have always loved this song. I remember when they sold cd singles and now there is digital singles the music just takes me away
0	What's not to like?  Clarkson at her best, great lyrics and melody and reminds me of "Love Actually" my all-time favorite movie.
0	Insider is one of TP's 'deep tracks' type tunes. It features layers of keyboard work by Heartbreaker Benmont Tench. Petty wrote this one with Stevie Nicks in mind, but she turned it down - her loss. But, you can catch the Petty-Nicks duet of Insider on YouTube.
0	I bought this album after seeing the documentary on HBO and it's even better than I expected!  The collaboration between the artists is fantastic and they produced a work of art that even Bob Dylan is bound to be proud of!
0	Sounds Great!
0	THIS ALBUM IS RARE FOR DEVOT PRINCE COLLECTOR I,M SO GLAD I OWN IT. THE TRACKS ARE VERY PRINCE JUST JAMMING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THE BAND. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR MORE COMMERCIAL PRINCE STUFF THIS IS NOT IT THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND YOURSELF HERE! BUY IT WHATEVER IT COST YOU!
0	Great movie!  Love the music .  Makes me laugh. Will watch every time it's on cable too even though I have it
0	Mos Def always gives you something to think about and I admire his versatility and range of talent. I find the message to be meaningful.
0	Relatively unknown artist, to be sure, but an excellent work. Smooth, listenable, excellent production and mastering. Based upon this disc, I got several others of his - I recommend him highly.
0	More people should take this advice to heart!
0	I love her old ballads and this is no exception. I can feel the heartache in every chord. LOVE it!
0	What's to say ... just love it. It's one of the greatest album of the last few years, and the quality of the sound on vinyl is absolutely perfect. Love it.
0	GREAT ALBUMS  !!!! THEY ARE AWESOME !!!  VERY RARE AND HARDER TO FIND NOW !!!
0	I grew up on this song
0	I really liked the movie and I really enjoy the music from the movie.
0	When I first heard Muse's music I thought they were copying radiohead. After listening to different songs from different albums they have released, I started to see the direction that they differentiate themselves from radiohead. This song is very mellow, kinda sad-sounding, emotional song. If you like muse's music and also mellow, relaxing songs, give this one a shot.
0	I'm a huge fan of the movie 'The Funhouse' so, of course, I love the soundtrack.  Even though the movie is labeled as an early 80's slasher, I feel it leans more toward the gothic hammer films of yesterday.  And with John Beal's intense, 'Phantom of the Opera' score, it's easy to see why.  The soundtrack is haunting, wonderful, and at times, just exhausting.  If you're a big fan of the movie, I suggest you order yourself this cd. It's a great, late night, scary listening, goth show. Plus, it's fun to kick back, close your eyes, and conjure up the movie's images as the music rolls along.  Now, I have a big question for any monster movie fans out there.  I've always thought 'The Funhouse' was John Beal's original piece. But, if that's the case, then, why does the 1963 movie 'The Terror' starring Jack Nicholson, play the same theme practically throughout the entire movie!?  I discovered this, needless to say, with much surprise, a year or two ago when I had the movie on, just for background noise, while I was doing things around the house.  What is up with this!? Did John Beal borrow the old music and just revise it for 'The Funhouse'? I've also heard another (!) similiar version (though, not as strong) on the opening episodes of one of the 'Night Gallery' seasons.  I looked on line to see if I could connect anything between 'The Terror' 'John Beal' or 'The Funhouse' with no luck.  Please! HELP ME if you can. This is a real head scratcher. I just have to know the true story behind this score.
0	Amazing!
0	FNM is just win all the time. and an import is great. great seller.
0	I bought this track for use as an aid in trance work. The music is quite effective for sonic driving, but I feel that it could be even more useful if it was louder. Even at my computer's highest volume setting, the track is rather quiet. I tried various volume boosting tools and techniques, none of which could increase the volume of the track without destroying its quality. It is for that reason, and that reason alone, that I cannot give this track a 5-star rating.
0	Wonderful collection!
0	CAPITOL LETTERS DEATH METAL FANS GUITAR SOLO FANS MUST GET THIS AWESOME MASTER PIECE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. S
0	I also heard this on All Things Considered and was instantly hooked. An excellent blend of hauntingly beautiful vocals and clean electronic beats. As I write this review, I'm on my third repeat. Love it!
0	This is the version of 'Spin Spin Sugar' that should have been released.  I've listened to remix after remix of 'Spin Spin Sugar', and Armand's version beats them all.
0	summertime sound!
0	It gets better the more I listen to it.
0	Just a thoroughly good album. All the emotion of their early stuff, but a little more grown up. So happy the band is still making music. CD case was kinda cracked when I got it, but that's the risk you take when you order CDs in the mail.
0	I just really like this song. Very good melodies, and is soothing to me. Give it a shot. I'd bet you'll like it.
0	Once again, a promising artist burns out way too early. Bought this album after Amy's death. What a loss of talent, which is evident in this record. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
0	This CD is fantastic.  I love every song and have been playing the entire CD again and again.  The songs are imaginative, compelling, spellbinding, mesmerizing, evocative, and at times utterly uplifting.  Christopher Tin's talent deserves to be heard.  Enjoy!!!
0	This was done in the 1980s and was great then and I love it now!  For anyone who loves harmony.
0	Great,
0	Ry has always been an incredible musician.  Here he uses politics as his focus.  This is a unique take on 2012 politics... The lyrics are hilarious, but hold true.  We just had the RNC nearby and many lines rang true.  Except for the stuff about Palin...I think Fox faux-news and the RNC excluded her. The closeted RNC kept the male and female prostitutes busy and the prostitutes sent them back home with some special presents. The lyrics are funny but true and are well written.  The underlying music is the best of Mr Cooder.  Could have been from many of the 70s best albums. There are several more detailed reviews here on Amazon so I recommend shoppers read several reviews (most are sterling).  A few of the right wing nuts who apparently don't like enlightened musicians... For those few right wingers Amazon offers burned out, failed musicians like Hank Williams Jr or Ted (the bird) Nugent...those idiots should offer you more  music to meet your needs (not good music, but right wing) ... As for one of the icons of music in the age of old baby-boomers, Ry is great as always. Don't like ry?  Strap your dog on the roof of your Bentley and head for west Texas but don't listen to Willy Nelson, don't listen to a Hispanic, don't listen to a black person or any band from Austin (you might be listening to someone who reads and thinks)... please make sure and stick with the grunts of Bosephus...
0	Excellent new songs, refreshing talent.  I hear they have more CD's, look  forward into checking into all of them.  Would like to see them live.
0	Good album, in the same vein as BB always does. Another one of their CDs that will grow on ya.
0	I love the song Hallelujah, particularly the Jeff Buckley rendition.  This is an excellent version and I am glad I added it to my collection.
0	#Prince
0	A timeless 80s era punk rock band that remains relevant with a great song here...
0	Lenny Kravitz is an amazing singer. He is still relevant after all of these years and he just keeps getting better with every new CD. I love this song!
0	Timeless Road traveling song. I don't even know what else Robert Plant might have done, but this song rocks! Smokey, soothing, thoughtful.
0	Love The new music
0	I purchased this for my fifteen year old daughter.  I knew that she liked Hamilton, but I didn't realize how much she loved Hamilton.  She won't stop playing it.  Okay, that's an exaggeration. When she does stop playing it, she sings it.
0	How cool is this??!!!! Bobby "Boris" Pickett took his all time Halloween classic back into the studio to rock it up and NAILS what I consider THE DEFINITIVE VERSION of his #1 hit!!!!  Woah....  This recording by the original vocalist Bobby "Boris" Pickett is THE graveyard smash!!!!!
0	Awesome!!!! Every song was one if my favorites!!!! But "the blood of Jesus"!!' That dong had me down on my knees or just stretched out on my bed meditating!!!!! I sm a diagnosed liver csncer patient but like VaShawn Mitchell says I am triumphant!!!!! "I'm more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ!" Amazon.com keep putting his albums out there and I'll keep buying them!
0	Its great
0	I always liked Floyd Cramer's unique way to render country tunes on the piano. His style is very smooth and soothing, very appealing. This one has always been one of my favorites. This song was originally recorded by Skeeter Davis, as far as I know. The sound is very good.
0	Lady A hit another home run with this song.  They are truly gifted.  I hope they keep singing for decades, and I'll keep buying.
0	Great!  Highly Recommended!  Some of Flower's best work!
0	Come on, this song from my childhood just makes me happy.
0	Cease to Begin is, in my opinion, a stronger album as a whole, certainly more confident. They seem to be more comfortable with themselves this time around. If you have the chance to see them live, don't miss it. Ben Bridwell's enthusiasm for music is really infectious, and will put a smile on your face, guaranteed. "Get some, dudes!!!!"
0	Again, appreciation of unique quality is my source of joy in this song.
0	Goff Radcliffe's beautiful Marenghi organ is in top form on these recordings. Sound quality is wonderful. A real treat.
0	Arrived when expected. GREAT album.
0	A present for my teenager daughter. She loved it.
0	This CD is very good.
0	Matt Nathanson has been a favorite of mine for a long time. His music speaks to me on a level I can't explain. The entire album is AMAZING from beginning to end. It starts off strong with Giants, a song that I could see being anyone's anthem. I have read in the past that people in a less "pop" frame of mind don't like songs with such a broad audience, but we all need to feel like we're on top of the world sometimes. The writing is honest and, as to expect from Nathanson, sexy. The title track is high energy and could get anyone pumped for anything. I love the blatant writing you get from Matt on nearly every song: even if he uses flowery language, you know what he is saying. I would recommend this album to literally anyone, but I am of the opinion that I need more Matt Nathanson in my life at any and all times. Compared to his other albums, I don't know what to say. He has a cohesive sound, but all of his work is separate at the same time. I don't know that it is my favorite album of his, but I also don't think I could pick a favorite, even if pushed.
0	I love this song and Kenny's version is beautiful....Great Christmas Song as well as all season song....Well now, I must right 20 words but all I can say is beautiful version of this classic song.
0	Great Music & Bods!!!
0	Quality product, great seller !
0	Now memories run with this a night at a local hotel packed with people and trying to get a drink of course I was wearing the black dress....
0	Been a hung fan of Sonny Landreth and this CD did not disappoint
0	good cuban music
0	I love his voice. Listen to it a lot.
0	I have always been searching for this song but to no avail. When I found who it was by and got it online, which I was told was better than getting through itunes because itunes won't download it all the way, I was instantly happy. This is definitely one of my new favorite songs :)
0	Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.
0	Yela is the truth. He has created his own style, and his music is resonating throughout the South. If you want something fresh, peep out YelaWolf!!! HALLER AT CHEE!!!!!!!
0	I purchased this song on a credit I received from buying an instant video. it downloaded just fine and I'm happy with it.
0	Genevieve is an absolutely incredible singer, and both she and the beat-boxing, break-dancing engineer DC have a really wonderful kid energy.  My 7 year old son loves to dance to the music and even my 13 year-old daughter really enjoys the music. They get to hear it a lot because my wife and I are always singing it around the house.  A very grateful dad.
0	this is a wonderful edited version.(sarcasm) many bad words, ($*it) are not taken out. all they take out is the f word and stuff, they keep these bad words (s**t, a** b**ch). my parents aren't big fans of that. its either scambels(the F word turns into ckuf, or uckf or something like that, and its not just the word that is scraambled, THE ENTRE AUDIO is scrambled. so its scrambles or completley taking a way that part of the song. ( no scramble or soung effect. its just basicly turning the volume down and back up again) i mean, cmon! they take away "die" but not the word "$h-t". how dumb. but the songs r still good, though. after a while, yull just get used to it.it wait till i was 12 or 13 or so. im 10, so my parents HATE the lack of editing.if they actually TOOK OUT SWEAR WORDS i might've given this cd a 5/5 star. o well.
0	A joy to listen to. Especially when reading Chernow's book.
0	OK the TV commercial that features this song has reinvigorated my interest in it,  but let's be honest...i's a kick ass party song!  A bang your head party song!  A LET'S GET THE PARTY GOING PARTY SONG!!!  YEAH!!!
0	Top shelf
0	such immortal phrases: "What if we took some fresh chicken's blood and sprinkled it around the Queen's chambers?"  "It is I, Arthur Pendragon, the Lady of the Lake"
0	This song is super anointed! i loved it the first time I heard it, I'm looking forward to more great music from Crystal; I aspire to sing like her and be able to touch lives  like the Spirit of th Lord allows her to!!
0	When my husband was alive and we went out dancing, you can be sure this was his most requested song. It brings back many happy memories.
0	Fantastic music from a guitar legend. James shreds like no one else can do. It's an album that is well worth owning.

0	This song is a classic if you grew up in the 80's.  Judd Nelson pumping his fist in the air is iconic.  And now with the release of Pitch Perfect and the showcase of this song, it has been revitalized.  Everytime I hear this song it brings a genuine smile to my face!
0	The soundtrack is an awesome mix of new and old. The collaboration for "Sucker For Pain" is great!
0	Awesome cd. And got it early!
0	Big Big Train have been around since 1990 playing their own brand of very English Progressive Rock.  The current line-up, consisting of Nick D'Virgilio, Dave Gregory, David Longdon, Andy Poole and Gregory Spawton are producing the best material of this lengthy career and, in my opinion, the some of the best music in the Prog scene as a whole.  I would even go as far as to say that this album and the last one (The Underfall Yard) are two of the best Progressive Rock albums released in the last few decades!  ...like all great albums "English Electric Part 1" takes a few listens to fully appreciate, but every track on the album has that rare combination of instant appeal and depth to draw you in and repay multiple listens;  Each replay is a delight of discovery as the true majesty of the music and the storytelling in the lyrics unfolds before your ears.  Big Big Train are masters of their art; they have incredible song-writing ability, musicianship, attention to detail and depth, astonishing production (well done Mr Rob Aubrey) ...and the lyrics and vocal delivery are just sublime.  The choice of subject matter and instrumentation makes the listening experience a walk back in time through the English countryside.  Pastoral vistas unfold, we hear of suffering in the harshest of working conditions contrasted with the simple pleasures of the countryside, eccentric artists hoodwinking the best in the business, tales of pioneering exploits pushing the boundaries of human endeavour.  It's gripping stuff; the kind of song writing that delivers spine chills by the bucket load and compels the listener to learn more about the subjects.  To give the uninitiated some idea of what BBT sound like; it would be easy and somewhat valid to draw parallels with early Genesis, but that would, in all honesty, be under-selling Big Big Train.  They have captured that quintessential English Prog sound, made it their own whilst, at the same time, injecting a fresh vibrancy to it so that it's relevant in the 21st century.  No mean achievement!  2012 has been a great year for music and BBT have been up against some stiff competition but in my book there's only one contender for album of the year and this is it.  I look forward to playing this album a lot more and am already anticipating the follow-up "English Electric Part 2" in 2013.
0	It's Buckethead!
0	I'm 20....gonna be 21 next year. And I was SUPER shocked by this album. I wasn't expecting this album to be THAT good. I thought I was going to like the few songs I heard already, and then the rest of the album would be totally different. But that wasn't the case at all. I actually enjoy EVERY song on this album. It may seem as if I'm a teeny bopper, but they've got really great tracks to dance to.  I would recommend this album to ANYONE, any color. These guys aren't just a one time deal, they are talented and make great music.  My favorites:  Boyfriend Big Time Rush Big Night Nothing Even Matters Worldwide City Is Ours Halfway There
0	This CD is amazing and really should put Desperation on the map.  Songs like "Who You Are" and "Ready Now" need to be on repeat everywhere you go.  The DVD that comes with it is great and insightful into their songs and what they are about.  Pick it up and listen through it a couple of times.  I think you will really enjoy it-
0	I purchased this song because of a line dancing choreography.
0	band from the 80's so if your young you probably haven't heard of them.
0	There isn't one bad song on this album. Each song flows to the next without effort. You won't find any filler songs on this album. This is a must have. I can see myself listening to this for the next 20 years easily.
0	I purchased this to use as prelude music for a small, country wedding and the arrangement was very well done.
0	Feel so good when listening this CD. every song sounds great! Love it! Come on, just buy it now everyone!
0	I don't have a lot of 70s but this is probably one of my favorite 70s songs of all time now I will dance the night away
0	great song & video also
0	Awesome Song!!! I definitely recommend downloading this song to everyone. If he did it before he can do it again. True statement. Trust God ALWAYS!!
0	Stephan's Vocals are slurred here and there during the Live concert.. He is a legend for sure. But, he has traveled the hard road of excess and it shows in this performance. To bad!!! He has been part of many memorable moments in Music of the 60's and 70's.. I love his solo efforts also. Look for concert footage from his heyday and you will really enjoy that..
0	Great uplifting, mellow music from Izzy (Isreal). Sadly, he won't be making any more, but it was great to have him in this world making sweet, calm music.
0	Great!
0	It's Christmas most of it was beautiful music playing. There was some singing involved but I wanted to here the song" miss you this Christmas" and it's Free.
0	This album is "Get the F@&# Out of Here" good! Everyone should listen and marvel at this perfect tapestry of history and pop culture. Everyone!
0	Perfect...Fast Shipping...No issues

0	Brenda Holloway was an R&B singer/songwriter from Atascadero, CA who signed with Motown in 1964. Though she never did hit it big she did have a pair of modest hits including 1964's "Every Little Bit Hurts" as well as this Smokey Robinson penned number "When I'm Gone" which peaked at #25 in April 1965. I thought she had a terrific voice. Years later she would be employed as a backup singer for the great Joe Cocker. This is probably one of those songs that you have heard but had no idea who sang it.
0	Jeez o Pete she's a good singer.
0	Timeless classic song with a good message.
0	Rickie Lee Jones can be somewhat of an acquired taste. I've always liked Traffic from Paradise, the album from which Running from Mercy is extracted. To me, Rickie Lee's music made a big shift around Flying Cowboys and Traffic. Running is a sweet song; slow, rambling, soothing in presentation, rich in harmonies.  It speaks to all the 'little kindnesses' that I sometimes forget.(I bought it for just that reason.) It does have a classic Rickie Lee tone but then, it is Rickie Lee. It's not of jams like Chuck E (slow rock), or Weasel and the White Boys (jazzy blues). If you like Rickie, you will probably like it. My opinion, and I could be wrong.
0	Good song
0	For me personally 2016 has been a challenging and difficult year, but this album has nearly single handedly kept me sane.  I have enjoyed Gojira quite a bit over the last few years.  I was introduced to them by seeing Mastodon in concert as Gojira opened for them on the Once More 'Round the Sun tour.  I picked up their previous albums and very much enjoyed them.  I tend to like heavy rock/metal that has a heavy melodic quality to it.  I also tend to like less death growls and more singing or screaming.  Gojira has tended to have a mix of those styles.  This album is a bit more accessible as there is less of the death growls and more singing and other styles that makes this album a bit more melodic and therefore more my speed.  I have become obsessed with this album...iTunes says my play count for this album is at 72 times since I purchased the CD and loaded onto my iPhone.  I love the lyrics and the heavy & melodic sound on this album.  Thank you Gojira!
0	Another great sounding album from Runestone. Very relaxing and very good for the ears.
0	I have always SheDaisy. This is just another wonderful addition.
0	Exceptional.  Why I liked Springsteen all these years.
0	i really like this song. The voice of BJ Thomas is one of the best voices i've ever heard. Great song
0	Her affiliation with the Post Modern Jukebox is wonderful.
0	Love this song so much I have some of the words on my wall.
0	Although I'm not a disco fan.  I like the lyrics.  Lots of us are looking for a nice town to live in.  And the music has a great beat along with the electronic music.
0	Arrived on time and well packaged and as described. This music is not for everyone, but if you like their other albums you will like this one.
0	It still sounds as good, and as relevant, as it did years ago, when it was first released. And you?
0	I love this song.  Alan Jackson is one of my favorite country singers, loaded with talent.  This is one of the best songs.
0	Loved this song ever since I heard it on The Walking Dead <3
0	Good songs plus good sound quality.
0	I like this song because it has a nice rhythm to it . I choose this because les miserable is a popular movie out. II don't like the curse words in it . I would maybe recommend this to someone
0	it the traditional song with just a little spice, Have yourself a merry littleChristmas has been redone my many greats and this version will one day be considered a great
0	The Queen of country music.
0	Beautiful song! The 80s sure had good music. Too bad people don't sing like this anymore.
0	Great music!
0	Great song. Brings back such good memories.
0	WHEN WILL THIS BE REISSUED ON CD??????  This is the album which would have brought KC back to Mega-Star status in the US, but as good as it is, it was cut down in a series of corporate blunders, many of which still baffle to this day.  True, his previous album, "The Painter" suffered from KC's obvious fatigue from the constant touring and the stress of his previous label, T.K. going bankrupt.  But this album showed all the signs of recovery.  Plenty of stellar songs, though the suits went with the wrong track for the first single, "(You Said You'd) Gimme Some More", which seemed to be a throwback to his 70s hits.  Then for the second single, they decided on the mid-tempo duet with Teri DeSario, "Don't Run (Come Back to Me)", which was great, but a bit formulaic for radio's tastes - it seemed that KC was "falling back" on a duet to "resurrect" himself.  All the while, there was a song on the album which had been a success in Ireland, so when the UK arm of Epic decided on another single, they followed suit and issued "Give It Up".  The song became KC's first UK Number One.  It wound up being among the biggest sellers there in 1983.  But the suits here in the good ol' US of A didn't think it would be a hit, so they declined to release it.  This led to KC negotiating his release from the label, and he formed his own record company to release his music.  He secured the rights to "Give It Up" and released it himself.  To say it was a hit is like saying Everest is just a hill.  For an independently released record, it hit the Top 20 (#18) in the spring of 1984.  I guess he showed 'em.  But the song would have done better with CBS behind him, so the opportunity to sell this great album was lost by the suits at CBS.  So when is Sony gonna reissue this already?  It's only been 31 years since they first put it out (the first year, BTW, of the CD).
0	Love it
0	This song has a haunting sound and in my opinion is one of Tim McGraw's best.
0	Bill Cosby is singing but he does a good job on this on. The bass and drums are butt kickin!.  I believe it's the guys from the 'Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band' playing on this.  Soulful as hell!
0	I was on a cruise where she was the featured performer and ALL in the audience we pleasantly SURPRISED how personable, clear, and pleasing her performance was.  It was like a mad dash at the conclusion that most of the full house (almost no old farts) congregated and stayed to get an autographed copy of her CD.  Live was great and the recording did not disappoint.
0	Great Sound!
0	Yet another great album in a long line of great albums. The Decemberists departed from their story telling formula to put together a batch of songs that flow together very well. The wife and I had this playing in the background while doing major house chores and didn't even notice that it was on repeat until about four hours later. By then we were singing along to all of the songs as if we had known them for years. Colin and the rest of the gang are such masters at melody and rhythm.
0	Great song!
0	Great oldie classic!
0	Life is full of lessons and challenges.  In the album, "Stanley Climbfall" by Lifehouse, the music is real and pure.  It expresses what it's like to go through life and search for whatever it is you're looking for.  The music has touched my life as well as my heart.  It has brought out feelings inside of me that I never knew I had.  When things are tough, I listen to "Stanley Climball" and I feel better about myself.  I recommend this album to anyone who goes through that frequently, rocky path and experiences what I have experienced.
0	Great album
0	This is one of my favorite Leon Redbone tunes. Has been for 35 years (is that possible?).  Attributed to Jelly Roll Morton. Give a listen:&nbsp;
0	AWESOME!!!
0	this was given to me and my daughter from a friend. Having many sleepless nights I now use this to fall asleep when I wake up and I cannot go back to sleep in the middle of the night
0	Love Bret, love this song, and it's so true on so many issues. I think there isn't anything it doesn't pertain to, love, work, kids, life itself, love it and it is now in my collection
0	Great box set to add to my collection.
0	Great song. I was happy to find it.
0	Love this album. They never disappoint.
0	Great song and these guys can really sing
0	An early Basie album for me.  Still think my original stereo copy sounds far better than a c.d.version I heard.  Maybe it's just me.  Decide for yourself.  Every track is good,especially Lullaby for Jolie.  Great Quincy Jones arrangemants and compositions.
0	Please tell me one one other band that has been around almost 40 years that still can write hit records like these guys??? Nobody does it better than Chicago! Call them corny, cheesy, or whatever..........but these songs are just plain fun!  The latest efforts by Clapton, Elton John ,Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, and Paul McCartney all pale in comparison to Chicago XXX...  YES!! there are probably more ballads on this record than I wanted but some of them are downright destined to be megahits!. No Question "King of Might Have Been" and "Love Will Come Back" with Rascal Flatts will be 2 more monster hits for the band  Chicago is a Hit machine and they prove it again on XXX!  "Caroline" and "Feel " aren't bad either, but where this CD really shines is on "90 Degrees and Freezing", with blasting horns and a monster guitar solo which takes you back to Chicago's rocking 70's era. Roll down your windows and crank up the volume on this one and you'll have people driving by and singing along with you. It's just a fun tune!!  Bill Champlin contributes some funky soul as well and "Lovin Chains" absolutely cooks!!!  Chicago will never be the same avant garde, progressive band as they were in 1970....Terry Kath is no longer alive and the music industry has changed dramatically and this band like many others have changed with the times...  Have you heard Clapton's most recent efforts??? He has mellowed so much that you can hardly believe he's the same guy who gave us "Layla" and "Sunshine of your Love".. In the same vein,don't expect Chicago to give us "25 or 6 to 4" or "Make Me Smile" again!!!  What they do give us on Chicago XXX is just some fun music that's perfect for a summer afternoon or a "Saturday in the Park"
0	A gorgeous song written beautifully and played even better. I like the way his voice sounds at this song. Lyrics are wonderful and I loved the part "make-up was designed for other girls to try and look like you".  Great song, Tom, I really love all your songs too much!
0	Cool lyrics, funny beat and everyone thinking the same thing, "DJ Quik, come on now! Let Saadiq sing!" Sheesh man....
0	This is a great CD.  I saw Gloria Bills in concert in Cadiz, KY back in October.  I bought their CD and couldn't stop listening to it.  "Always Sometimes" is one of my favorite songs now.  Oh yeah, and  the sister of the lead singer works at Sonic here in Cadiz.  Funny, huh?  Mmmmmmm....cheeseburger.
0	This song is awesome to dance too and sing along with at parties or even long car rides along.  Up beat rhythm and all; you can't go wrong!
0	great record
0	Wow, after listening to his confession regarding his health struggle, you can see where his spiritual growth in Christ has come from.
0	They have some great praise and worship songs.  We truly need Him to lead us to the cross , thank you Jesus for your sacrifice.
0	I love this song.  It is explicit, so you need to make sure you know that before you buy it if you are offended by swearing.  I liked it before it was pointed out to me what exactly he was saying...the melody just did it for me!
0	I love the whole album. I could listen to it over and over. And it comes with the Auto Rip, so I could download it immediately. Awesome.
0	The title of this song says it all.  Want victory, "shift the atmosphere" in your praise and worship.  That were the victory is.
0	My favorite Christmas song!
0	A kick ass rock band!! Check them out. Their version of the National Anthem is the best I've heard. And I'm a traditional guy, but this is the best.
0	Amazing song!
0	I love this group, I only wish it was the longer version and that I could get the video. But love having it on my new kindle and quit the new sound it is great.
0	Love the Killers and "All These Things That I've Done"  Just makes a body Happy Happy Happy!! Thanks so much!!
0	Alex Clare is a descriptive singer. You can feel his emotions and feelings. Each song has a different meaning but really keeps you wanting more. I definitely recommend this album.
0	Who doesn't love Smokey Robinson....you won't be disappointed.  Great music!!!!  That's my opinion....hope you enjoy as much as I have.
0	This is a classic CD to have in your belly dance collection. It is a wonderful mix of classic songs that everyone should dance at least once.
0	Loved this song in The Navigator
0	Love the new song. Sounds like some of their earlier songs. Can't wait for the new Album.
0	One of my favorite songs ever by the great Lou Reed and covered by one of my favorite bands Duran Duran.  Can't get enough of this song.
0	I will be honest, I haven't listened to the other songs. However cruise is one of mine (and my two year olds) favourite songs on the raido currently. She loves to rock out around the house to it.
0	Having only recently discovered Skillet, I bought this song as a digital download (mp3 version) because I really liked the track so much!  As usual I think it sounds great, and I think it was a great value.
0	One of the sweetest, most meaningful songs made! Can listen this on repeat n it never gets old! A #1hit that's for sure!
0	I LOVE THIS SONG AND WITH MY SON PASSING AWAY IT MAKES ME FEEL CLOSER TO HIM, KNOWING THAT I WILL SEE HIM AGAIN - AT THE CROSSROADS!
0	The song is very romantic, and Enrique Iglesias has a magnetic voice.  Highly recommended.
0	Great dance tune- Willie is the best!
0	Great bluegrass gospel CD! I love it!
0	I hated their voice at first, and I hated the lyrics. But I listened to the whole thing twice, and it actually is kinda catchy. But everyone is different. For example my sister leaves the room when this song comes on so it really just depends on how the music rings inside your ears.
0	awesome
0	If you like deadmau5 then this is a no brainer. One of my personal favorites from the artist. By now the artist has reached a level that if you're looking at this album, you're probably going to buy it anyways.
0	Beautiful classic
0	This is a great rendition of the song.  It preserves the meaning of the original song and lyrics while presenting it in a way that is palatable to modern listeners who may not be as familiar with old English and older styles of songs.  I also think that this was a great song to choose.  And it was very nice of her to offer this song as a free download.
0	If you love good music, then you'll love Stanley Climbfall.  I haven't gone a day without listening to this whole CD because it's so amazing.  The guys from Lifehouse have done a wonderful and beatufiul job putting together this CD.  It's a combination of touching lyrics and rockin' music.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone and I can guarntee you that you'll love it. I've had all my friends listen to it, and they went and got their own copy afterwards. You are seriously missing out on great music if you don't get this CD!!!
0	Father and Son is just one of the Cat Stevens songs I absolutely LOVE. In fact, there isn't one that I don't love. If you aren't familiar with this song, I highly recommend it. Only wish he was still doing concerts. He would be sold out for sure. Love HIM!
0	My favorite song from him!
0	Moving On is a great debut for this indie musician. Her blend of folk and coffee-house blues is a welcome change to my music library. I especially liked the songs Western Desert Sun and Lorelei.  Also, if you can find her newest album The Homeplace, I highly recommend it as well. I didn't see it on Amazon, but you can find it on iTunes.
0	Awesome song for the movie . Lana Del Rey is the perfect person for the song. Loved the original and love this one more!
0	I have always like her type of music. I have other Cd's by her. What I did not like about this cd was I personally did not like all of the songs. I just could not get into it. I bought this cd because I love the one song I hear all the time play on the radio. I still recommend this Cd.
0	Enjoyable if you like this genre.
0	A merengue that inspires your love of life and makes you just long to get on the dance floor.  Love it!
0	Professionally played concert pieces for about .01 each. Do I really need to write a review? Don't be ridiculous. Buy it.
0	My prejudice is that I am a Wailin' Jennys fan but this is still a very good album by anyone's standard.  My favorite tracks are Bird Song and Bright Morning Stars.  The album is typified by tight harmony and smooth, country, female vocal sound.  That said I did not find it as captivating as 40 Days but still worth the buy.
0	Great, old song!  Amazon has every song I remember growing up!
0	Beautiful, touching, well-written ballad of quality you just don't hear anymore. Very emotional tune. Fairly McCartney/Lennon-esque, actually. Having written the song for his wife, the singer really pours his heart and soul into it in a personal way. Downloaded on a whim after hearing that back-story and fell in love with it -- you probably will, too.
0	His music had a very strong middle eastern influence, which personally I liked. .
0	This was  a song I remember from years ago and i recently heard it on the radio. Had to have it on my MP3.
0	Good quality but you have to download amazing music to have to song  in you phone
0	I recently purchased this CD and liked it alot. If you like Blink 182 or Greenday you'll like this CD. It has the flavor of Blink and the style of Greenday. Pick it up its worth it.
0	This is the best album!  Amy Winehouse has such a magical voice!
0	Beautiful rendition. Sends chills over me and brings me to tears.
0	Having beaten the shinnola out of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Portal/dp/B00140P9G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Portal</a>, I have a great appreciation for this song. If you haven't beaten, or even played the game, you'll likely be as confused as I was when I heard it.  It isn't the best song in the world, but it is a very fun song, and for even more fun make sure you check out VGCats.com and the strip they did centered around it! Then go buy this download! It's worth all the pennies I paid.
0	Excellente.
0	Like the song; City of Prague Philharmonic is becoming a favorite; they are world-class musicians. Bought the album after this purchase.
0	This is a nice fluffy little song that harkens back to summer and simple times.  Got a beach vibe and the lyrics are simple.
0	I had purchased her 1st mp3s, just 4 songs about a year ago and still love them.  So glad she released more
0	I like this song more for the funky beat than the actual lyrics. I try to get my groove on whenever i hear this song. It is definately a different tune.
0	Absolutely love this song. Great song to listen to with the window down on a sunny day. Recommend it to anyone that is a sun baby like me.
0	Love it
0	I have not seen the movie but I did enjoy most of the songs from this soundtrack.  James Horner continues to produce good work.
0	This is a great song. It's been used in tv commericals and movies. I played it for my 2 1/2 year old grandson and he said "play it again grandma".  Its a song for any age.
0	I tried to find other songs from Apocalypitca on this album that I liked bu this was the only one I could find.  This song, however, is amazing.
0	Love, love, love it!!!!  Would buy more CDs by Matthew West any time. Need 8 more words.....love, love, love it!
0	This song was on my heart so strong after  losing everything in the STORM. All I could do was praise Him for His grace and mercy over my family and next door neighbor. His abundant provision for us in starting over. I stand amazed at all the people whose hearts He moved on to love and support my family. I saw His Hand in everything that was touching my life. When He said He was able to do exceedingly, abundantly more than we could ask or think, He is faithful to His word. I am overwhelmed by His love. Thank you so much for this great song you have given us to help express how we feel going thru our storms in this life. Linda Hix
0	Jeremy Denk plays these difficult pieces with understanding. His written explanation of how  Beethoven's sonata foreshadows Ligeti is instructional and entertaining.
0	One of the best albums ever.
0	The first time that I ever heard Kurt Cobain sing "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was the first time that I saw the video on MTV back in 1991.  There was no skintight spandex, no shiny leather, no feathered hair, no expensive sports cars, no drooling scantily-clad women, etc.  Instead, there were three average guys in blue jeans and regular shirts rocking harder and better than any 1980's glam-rock band could ever hope to achieve!  Songs such as "Come as You Are", "Something in the Way" and "In Bloom" spoke to the average people a lot more than hearing & watching the typical egocentric hair-band paryting in a hotel room. Too much of 1980's pop rock and glam-rock had become predictable and clich.  People needed to hear something different and Nirvana was one of the groups that walked into the spotlight forever changing the sound and shape of rock-and-roll forever!  Once Nirvana's "Nevermind" hit the streets (along with albums by Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins and other alternative rock bands), 1980's pop rock and glam-rock died in what seemed a only matter of months. Nirvana's "Nevermind" will forever be a powerful testament to rock's revolution against excess.  It's an album that will always be in my collection and one that I frequently listen to. Thanks Kurt for bringing rock back to the people.
0	Great album. Must have for priest or wu fans. But, PWOWR was a must have for anyone who likes music period. This one not on same level so 4 stars. I'm jamming it and looking forward to what priest gives us next.
0	these guys are amazing
0	I've had the record for many years now having the CD allows me to enjoy it in my vehicle. It's an excellent addition to my musical collection.
0	All Mass Production albums deserve to be released in CD, this one in particular which contains some funk gems like "Turn up the music" or "I got to have your love". It has to be released in CD !
0	What's to say? You either love this song of you don't. I happened to be in college in the 60s when this song was introduced. To this day, 50 years later, it practically gives me flashbacks! Love it!
0	I bought this CD at a Dickie Lee concert in Milwaukee so hopefuly he is making some money on it. It's a great CD. The sound may not be the best, but neither are my ears after 25 years in a factory.
0	I thoroughly enjoy this cd. Thanks, Bob. You put a little fun and romance back in the world when we sorely need it.
0	YES!
0	I purchased this song specifically to add to my praise and worship playlist. Its such an awesome song and his voice delivers it so wonderfully.
0	AS EXPECTED
0	I love Imagine Dragons .... Great songs that go beyond Radioactive (which I do love so) Grab yourself a copy today ;)
0	My son loves everything Ross Lynch--Austin & Ally, teen beach movie and especially R5. He tries to dance like Ross, the whole family loves it!
0	love this version
0	My brother gave me this album 30+ years ago and I was hooked!  I was delighted to see it was available as a CD.  Cross's music takes me home to North Carolina, and I remember hearing many of these songs in concert at UNC-G and off Franklin St in Chapel Hill.  I was so happy to hear these songs once again on CD. The Scottsman still makes me laugh out loud and Lord, Let Me Die still gets me to tear up.  Best part is Mike can get my husband to sing along and tap his feet!
0	We got a surprise from King Kendrick and I loved this thing, not sure what to even call it, an EP, album, but basically what this is, is 8 "throwaway" tracks that either didn't make it into TPAB or he just had laying around. As you can tell from the name of this project, it's all untitled and unmastered in the rawest form which I thought was very cool, it has a more personal and even live feel through out some of the tracks. When it comes to the sound it was very smooth and very TPAB esc, which I really liked. I'll do track by track raitings here  Untitled 01 - interesting intro with a man with a deep voice talking pretty sexually and then Kendrick comes in very aggressively, pretty good track but nothing really that stands out. 7/10  Untitled 02 - this is one of my favorites on this project, he uses his voice as an instrument in this track and he sings in this kind of cracked voice and then it gets more trap influence. 10/10  Untitled 03 - I believe he performed this one on the Colbert show. In this track he goes in the perspective of a few different races and sees the world in their eyes. Great track but some people prefer the live version, I like both. 9/10  Untitled 04 - not much to say here, it's basically an interlude. N/A  Untitled 05 - this track starts off with about 2 minutes of just the beat and then Kendrick starts spittin. Good track but nothing special in my opinion. 7/10  Untitled 06 - very smooth track with beautiful production with ceelo delivering some great vocals. 10/10  Untitled 07 - this is my favorite track on this project with the first half being more turn up and the second half being like a live sit down in the studio with Kendrick. 10/10  Untitled 08 - this is also one of my favorites and definitely the most groovy track on this project, with beautiful production and great flow through out the whole song. I believe he performed this on Jimmy Fallon. 10/10  Production: 9.5  Lyrics: 10  Flow: 10  Subject Matter: 10  Delivery: 10  Replay Value: 8  Total Score: 8.5  If you're a Kendrick fan then there's no reason not to like this, definitely cop it.
0	I must have listened to this song 10 times straight once I bought it.  It's simply a delight, a true delight.
0	The superb acoustics of the Walt Disney Concert Hall enhance this performance of three disparate but well aligned works that comprise this downloadable recording.  For those without the ability to add yet another electronic instrument to the system hopefully at some point be considered when this live performance is committed to CD, but until that time catching each of these works individually will satisfy those who deeply admire Esa-Pekka Salonen - both as composer and as conductor.  'Helix' is a brief but fascinating exploration of sound and rhythms that introduces a rather traditional concert feeling.  As Salonen commits more time to composition his strengths as a keen colorist and orchestrator are ever more evident.  Jean-Yves Thibaudet tosses off Ravel's elegantly romantic 'Concerto for the left hand in D' with just right amount of technical agility and an equal amount of profundity in the beautiful Lento movement.  Salonen draws a particularly French sound from the orchestra making this recording now among the best of this unique concerto.  But for this listener, having been present in the hall for the performance of the Suite from Prokofiev's 'Romeo and Juliet', the manner in which Salonen and the LA Philharmonic have mastered the drama, the playfulness, and the tragedy of this great ballet makes one wish the entire score was available.  There is some fine first desk solo work throughout, but the contrast between the strident, discordant brass that sets the tone for the drama and the passion of the Balcony Scene and the music form the last act tomb scene is as compelling as any other recording of this score.  Hopefully DGG will continue to present these 'concert series' and proceed to place them on CDs for those of us who still enjoy the tradition music library access!  Grady Harp, November 09
0	Salif Keita won international acclaim in 1987 with his masterpiece Soro, a brilliant fusion of the Malian musical tradition with modern technology. The follow-up, Ko-Yan, was disappointing since his voice seemed to have  been sacrificed to insensitive production. It's therefore a pleasure to  report that Amen was a great return to form, featuring highly melodic,  hook-filled tracks with a sense of space, variety and danceability in which  that mellifluous voice comes into its own. The tracks address contemporary  issues such as the quest for democracy in West Africa in the song Waraya,  but there are also beautiful love songs like the boyant Yele N Na, the  rousing Karifa and the trilingual N B'i Fe. Throughout the album, producer  Joe Zawinul harmoniously reconciles Keita's voice with breezy arrangements  and the technical expertise of the jazz fusionists who assisted Keita in  creating this rivetting slab of sound.
0	When R Kelly was singing his songs were good hits! I like a lot of his older songs. I use to listen to them when I was younger. Its nice to find them on Amazon and slip away in the good ol days
0	I can dig it.  Love this version
0	One of my favorite songs of all time
0	Theres a reason why people get hooked on LP's. It's not just a style thing. I'm a lover of music, particularly dirty and raw rock and roll. In this sense I can listen to any format or tinny piece of radio, tape, 8 track etc. you throw at me... but it is a solid fact that certain albums just sound light years beyond any other format when played on LP.  Jethro Tulls THIS WAS is a fine example. This was the bands first release back in 1968. I have a copy of the first press, that has been kept in pretty decent shape (not fantastic) and when I put the needle on this thing I am surrounded by a magical combination of sounds.  I really dig this earlier period of Jethro Tull. It's got a strong core in jazzy rhythm, with the combination of drums, bass, and Ians flute work making a cool and subtle groove, while the guitar comes off with a trashy rawness... not as heavy as on more contemporary Tull works like Aqualung etc. but trashy and raw all the same. It's a wonderful blend of class and trash. The Cd just doesn't pop off the same way... sure it's passable, but if you listen to the vinyl you will instantly notice the difference. Flutes are way underated, and I believe it's because the digital transfers just don't fully express the beauty of the instrument :)  There are one or two moments when shoddy production shows. SONG FOR JEFFREY is not quite up to perfection. There is such an outstanding performance of this song on the Stones Rock and Roll circus disc, which features Tony Iommi on guitar, that it's hard to excuse the version here for being so muddled... but aside from that, the production is the charm. This is before the band got progressive, they just jammed it up on jazzy blues, and its stuff that I could listen to all day. Friggin cool as HELL!!!  This is an LP worthy of converting for (or back for, oldtimers... it's finally come full circle!) CD's are DEAD!!!
0	Beautiful praise music to relax and enjoy!  Wonderful purchase for anyone wanting to offer prayer through music.  A must buy.
0	My hubbys favorite
0	I ordered this as a gift and was able to download the digital copy.  I had never heard of Glass Animals before, but I like their sound.
0	This CD is one of the best CD's of an artist I have heard in a long time.  From the first song to the last - - each is excellent.  I have not heard a CD like this in a long time.
0	CHRIS BOTTI IS UNBELIEVABLE.
0	when this song first came out in the nineties,i loved it then and its  still a great song. Go Tony

0	Use it for my spin class.  Awesome.
0	Now this tune is KK at his best!  Great example!
0	If you are a fan of Shelley Fabares and love listening to the girl singers from the late 50s early 60s you will really enjoy listening to this cd. Johnny Angel has always been my all time favorite song and I have always thought that Shelley had a beautiful singing voice. These songs have an innocence and charm to them that made this music very pleasant and relaxing to listen to. I love listening to all these songs and hearing this music makes me feel very happy. I love also listening to the other girl singers from that same time period- Connie Francis - Annette - Brenda Lee - Connie Stevens - Lesley Gore . You will be very happy to have this cd in your collection. By the way I am 51 years old and I am a child of the 60s and a teenager of the 70s - so I discovered this music in 1976 when I was 17. At that time no one my age was listening to this music or even heard of it. After listening to this music for 34 years it still gives me so much pleasure to hear it. If anyone would like to comment on my review I look forward to hearing from you. Jay
0	The company provided prompt shipment, product in advertised condition and the selected sound great. If you love music this is a great selection.
0	Nice
0	Like the song
0	You will be blessed. John is the best.
0	Complete awesomeness
0	I like all music and ON THE ROAD AGAIN is one of Willie Nelson's best.  Great beat and lyrics and typical of one of our great country characters.  The words describe him.  The song makes you want to go on the road with him and his friends.
0	The song when the Stewart of Gondor sends his son Faramir to reclaim Osgiliath, knowing that he will most surely die.  Pip's song... all shall fade.  Good version.
0	Cute song to use for my granddaughter's slide show she loves candy and the song lasted for all the pictures I had taken
0	Perfect CD
0	We heard Blind Boys of Alabama live and loved them. The CD didn't disappoint. Take the High Road and I Know a Place are personal favorites.
0	This song was the song on the season finale of Ugly Betty when Justin finally danced with his guy crush and I fell in love with this song. Renee Oldtead has a beautiful melodic voice that is so soothing. I love her music.
0	I am a fan of Tye Tribbett in which he continues to produce songs that you can identify with.  This song is awesome!
0	Hobbit movie music is always cool
0	I got this because a library colleague wanted to have them perform for one of our functions... but I had never heard of them before. Heard a few of their songs on Youtube and Pandora and had to get one of their CD's to check them out more... I was not disappointed.

0	Bought this for a special friend who is greatly enjoying this CD.  She thinks very highly of Rinpoche and loves this CD.
0	The way he makes me feel, sung by Barbra Streisand, is a beautiful song.  The movie, Yentl, was a masterpiece.
0	High quality version of a great song! You can hear all the notes and different instruments. Really a pleasure to listen to!
0	The Rob Zombie classic, Living Dead Girl is actually a great song created from pieces of several different old classic horror movies. The title is named after a film made in 1982 by Jean Rollin. The first line in the song you hear speaking is a clip from a movie trailer from the film "Lady Frankenstein". Many other lines in the song are also taken from movies such as "The Last House on the Left", "Daughters of Darkness", "Dr. Goldfoot" and "Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS". The music video is really a sight to see, having clips from the old silent 1920's film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari". While the song sounds dark, there's a lot of humor in the video and nods to classic films from long ago. Many people just hear it as another song, but it's really a great compilation of film quotes from classic movies.
0	superb!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	This song has a lot of meaning to it if you are older!! LOL
0	Great CD.  Every song  fantastic   I'm waiting  for  the  book to be delivered. Every album  better  than  the  last.
0	But, I miss a little of keyboard (Richard Wight). :(
0	This is a great collection of classical music. I have listened to it while driving, reading and just laying in bed. An amazing collection for such a small price!
0	Great tune! Really takes you back.
0	I miss those goodnight kisses
0	I will admit, I am kinda, sorta hooked...okay, borderline obsessed with this album. I've been playing it non-stop for months. Two reviewers below, hit it right on the money. Absolutely buy the Deluxe version, the extra songs not on the American release are worth the extra money. And Take Me Home blows Adele's Hello out of the ballpark. The passionate lyrics and melody captured me immediately and ripped a hole open in my heart. I also recommend watching the official music video for Take Me Home, it is brilliant and very moving. Jess Glynne said it was done all in one take and I believe that added to the raw, true emotion she was able to convey.  Every song, for me, is a 5/5. This woman can do absolutely no wrong in my book. When you listen to the album, let your mind strip away the music and listen to the lyrics. This album tells a complete story. Feeling alone in the world. Finding someone that gets you. Falling in love. Doing everything possible to keep that love even though the other person wants more than you can give. Having your heart broken as your relationship, one you thought was with your soulmate, crumbles until you have no choice but to break up. Not falling out of love. Feeling angry because you gave your all to something that didn't work. Being able to pick yourself back up and breath again. It truly is wonderful. Jess Glynne is a powerhouse vocalist, emotional lyricist, and soulful person that is beautiful inside and out. Anything Jess Glynne touches will end up in my music library. Once I'm committed to an artist, any artist, I stick with them though all their growths and slumps. Something tells me, there will be no slumps in Jess Glynne's future. Cannot wait for more!
0	It was a hit many years ago and still a wonder song.  A favorite of mine and my husband.  We really enjoy being able to download just the songs we want.  I wish some of the older songs would come back again, at least they were music.
0	I loved this Album the first time I heard and still feel exactly the same way about it even ten years after I bought it. Very melodic and dreamy. Something you can just kick back and enjoy while you ponder.
0	love the song
0	I really dig this cd. But she does have better ones.
0	The genius seems to have more than one style. His album before this one sounded so different.
0	golden oldie for those of us who appreciate the music of the 60s and 70s
0	Smooth & relax.  Good for driving
0	Excellent song--haunting lyrics and melody
0	Loved
0	This song is so encouraging and inspirational it was like it was coming from the depths of her heart.  I enjoyed this song so much, I want others to feel want I felt when  I heard this song.  It was like she put her everything in this one song.
0	The young lady can play. If you like the blues, you will love this CD.Don't take my word for it, buy it !
0	A great song. Adele has created an amazing opening song to one of the vest bond films.
0	Ya gotta get this is you're a 60's bubblegum lover.  Ya GOTTA!  I'd never heard of them until a friend sent me a Youtube link to this song.  It's SUPER cool!  Have a listen...
0	This long-awaited second CD from these two talented musicians features holiday tunes and medleys from many cultures, all with a sense of peace, joy and celebration. I think my favorite is Los Reyes Oriente - a traditional Puerto Rican Christmas tune. All the tunes are perfect listening on a cold wintry night!
0	One of the greatest post punk 1994-1999 releases ever. (first album's even better!)
0	This is good music no matter where you are.
0	This album is incredible; it's my new favorite!!
0	Excellent
0	Ha Ha Ha
0	First and most all... The police have been a bit hit back ine day. Brings back memories..Going through their songs I woukld have to get most or even all the albams
0	This is an amazing song by an amazing German heavy metal band! I am not German, and I do not understand the language, but I don't have to, because this song rocks! I found out about this band recently, through the other popular German band, Rammstein. Both of these bands are awesome with kick a$$ music! \m/  5/5
0	great song! and so easy to download, MP3 format is still more compatible with various items so it will always play!
0	love this song, great
0	Classic Cash. His music defines his life and adds perspective. Doesn't get any better.
0	The Doobie Brothers version is great. I have bought this so many times thru the years and never get tired of it.
0	Great record
0	A most have like a anthum.
0	I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.
0	I have followed Lea since she first appeared on Glee. she has a voice that so powerful. and I am happy to see her career continues to climb.
0	This is the only way to shop and find it all. very happy.
0	This is one of those tunes that everyone falls in love with at first listen then it drifts into obscurity as time goes by, disposable pop that should remain timeless.
0	This was a  great product  which came in a very timely manner.  Keep up the good work .
0	Peaceful and relaxing. Very nice cover of this classic tune.
0	W is the musume twins, who came from morning musume. 2nd generation if i remember correctly. last i checked they're on 13 generations now. KOI NO VACANCE is a tribute album to 1960's group the peanuts who are real twins. music is cute, upbeat and pretty old school now. oh.. and rather hard to find.
0	My family and I really love this CD because it uplifts the name of the Lord in a fresh, exciting way.
0	Great CD!Get into it!!!!
0	Great sound great quality. A little loud though, but that's good cuz you can always turn it down. Audio sounds very good, but I'm not sure if id buy from this album here again
0	I love this CD! I have it in my car and hear it all the time. It never gets old and is always inspiring. It's too bad that she died too early because she might have blessed the world with more wonderful music.
0	Awesome cd.
0	This is wonderful.
0	I bought this track for my dad for his birthday gift. He told me about this song awhile back hence the gift. We were riding in the car and played this track. He said he would have this song be played at his funeral; make it more upbeat and lively instead of the usual, traditional music played. It makes sense to me.
0	Mandisa is a powerhouse singer with an uplifting and positive message that will inspire you to new heights!  Check out her tours, you won't be disappointed!
0	In 'Mezzanine', Massive Attack main-man Robert Del Naja has summoned from the dark abyss an extraordinary record, best served in the safety of your own home with all doors and windows safely locked.  There ought to be an advisory sticker warning against playing this on your Walkman while walking down dark alleys. Edgy, brooding, menacing - this is sonic murk of the highest calibre.  Opening song `Angel' would have been used by Hitchcock had he re-made Psycho in a Blade Runner setting. Prowling, phased drums and a hypnotic bass line build to an eruption of distorted guitar chords and a disturbing vocal delvery.  Defining moments come aplenty. A minute into 'Teardrop', Liz Frazer's haunting vocal shudders into life against a crystal-clear heartbeat and instrumentation designed for atmosphere over and above any dance floor ambitions.  Chilled-out? Frazer's vocal delivery is as blissful and mesmerising as anything she has done during or after her Cocteau Twins career. The effect knocks `Song to the Siren' into the same cocked hat that Neil Davidge threw out with the rubbish when he began producing this album.  `Inertia Creeps' bursts to life with the type of Byzantine chaos that litters Peter Gabriel albums. Here, as with the band's groundbreaking `Blue Lines' album, hip-hop vocal influences sneak through, but on Mezzanine the words are whispered rather than blasted through a megaphone. Goth-hop anyone?  Throughout the production, bass lines register on a level that never leaves the pit of your stomach. Intelligently crafted drum and synthesizer loops augment rather than overpower the songs.  This album was voted number 15 in Q magazine's list of 100 all-time best British albums. The Prodigy's `Fat of the Land' only made 47. It's not hard to see why this dark, brooding, monster of an album is considered so highly by critics. It's a work of true genius.
0	As usual Groban's music continues to be amazing.  Can't wait for the new CD to come out.  Love this song.
0	Love this band great CD. My friend bought me the whole CD after I bought the one song :) LOVE IT
0	Happy, easy to find.
0	Great song! I can see why Cigna Health Care chose it for their commercial! Only reason it didn't receive 4 stars is that it's too short.
0	This is a beautiful song that really makes you feel and think of the season.  Kenny Rogers does a wonderful job of it.
0	This album fills your surroundings with a cleansing divine vibration, so sombre and subtle...so pure, so rejuvenating..Transcendental transportation to heavenly abode
0	This is the best album ever.  And I don't even understand a word of French!
0	Gorgeous voice and upbeat lyrics .... "Sunny Day" makes me FEEL like I'm having a sunny day, even if it's raining outside.  Love, love, LOVE!!
0	another great collection, evocative of the great spirit of our Western movie traditions ! city of prague philharmonic does a great job
0	Excellent song liked and bought it even before I saw the movie .
0	great song
0	I saw these guys live at the Fillmore East and they won't admit it but they were climbing the curtains. Fantastic live band
0	Patrick O'Hearn's music has always been like chicken soup for the soul to me. His beautiful, haunting melodies don't invoke momentary happiness or sadness, but instead a true feeling of being uplifted and inspired that stick with you, even after you've been done listening for a while.  Mr. O'Hearn reminds me a little bit of Pixar... Each of his albums is amazing, and could almost be better than the last one if the last one could even be topped! There are never any albums I do not play often, nor are there ever any songs I skip. Same with his new masterpiece "Transitions."  Just like with any great album, you'll have to listen to it multiple times to really soak it all in. You'll love it on first listen, but the more you listen, the deeper the music gets. It's best to dedicate a good amount of time to listening this album without distractions. I truly enjoy it through headphones with no distractions, or turned up loud in my car stereo when driving!  The title track, 'Reaching Land' is ... epic! It constantly builds up and ends with many beautiful sounds and melodies. 'Playground' lives up to it's name as a playful, uplifting song with great sounds used with the instruments and melody. 'Patterns' is an absolute gem. The notes all go together to create one complex melody that is haunting and wonderful. The ending track, 'Frontiers Revisited' is a masterpiece. I am not much of a musical person (just a listener) so please bear with my descriptions as best you can, hehe, and take my word for it... This is ambient music that will inspire you, that you will get addicted to, and that will make you think!!!  I have a little rule that I don't listen to my favorite music as I drive to work because I find that when I listen to the music again, it reminds me of work! But I have been breaking this rule the past week or so. I just can't help it... This album is so great!!!
0	LOVE Lindsey Stirling
0	str8
0	What better pairing than Broadway and Josh Groban! Heaven in my ears!
0	This one is a high four stars. Not my favorite, but I like it a lot. The world of rock and roll, really misses Janis Joplin.
0	Great album
0	good
0	I guess I was born at the right time. To me, this song is musical crack. I can listen to this over and over all day long. I am just about 50 years old. and Amazon crap just  sucks. I love it. every7body loves it . my Mom Loves it. Edit. I don't know why I said Amazon crap sucks. Amazon is pretty damn cool.
0	Needed song for my husband to learn the drums to for his band. Was able to burn to a CD so that he could listen to it while he was driving for his job.
0	superb everything has described
0	Great.
0	great 80s song.
0	Excellent work by a true legend.
0	I remembered this song one day....and began researching it online. My flate ather once owned the vinyl record. He frequently played different genres of music music around the house. I grew up loving all kinds of music. I have not heard this song since childhood. The vinyl record of course is lost now. This digital song was sung by much the same/similar original artist I'd listened to growing up. It brought back wonderful memories of happy childhood days.
0	Sounds great to me. Disco is about the bass.
0	The special 1963 UNITED NATIONS label LP of ALL STAR FESTIVAL was issued as a fundraiser in aid of the world's refugees. I have the stereo European pressing (88000 DY), but a U.S. edition (UNS-1) was also available, as were mono versions.  SIDE ONE NOTES 1.) Crosby is the worse for wear on "Lazy River," but Satchmo plays solidly behind him then adds some exuberant scatting, enough to make Bing chuckle. They duet the coda with a chorus. 2.) Chosen specifically for UNICEF, this pious song by Doris Day and choir quotes some of the Ten Commandments. 3.) Nana's track includes such traditional Greek instruments as the mandolin-like bouzouki. It's the optimistic song of a peasant starting his workday who's just happy to be alive. 4.) Chevalier performs a number written for this LP. "Life," he tells us, "is like a beautiful girl." 5.) On the romantic ballad "First Star," Patti's voice is double-tracked (a la "Tennessee Waltz"), but with a faint repetition at far right sound stage. 6.) Ella and swinging big band close out Side One with her acrobatically sliding vocal on the evergreen "All of Me." Naturally, she scats partway through.  SIDE TWO NOTES 1.) A song of reflection that seems to parallel Piaf's sad life wasn't written with her in mind but could've been. A classic "conversation piece" by one of France's greatest vocalists. 2.) Just one of the dozens of gorgeous romantic ballads Nat Cole crooned over his brilliant 20-plus year career. 3.) A melancholy tune dating to the 16th Century is nicely performed by Anne Shelton, a throaty contralto of much vocal beauty. 4.) Performed with an upbeat Latin rhythm, it's the story of a child who begs for bread to feed his hungry father, firewood to warm his freezing mother, also an ice cream for himself. Granted these wishes, the boy smiles broadly. 5.) A gospel piece written by Mahalia--who could sing it better? She's backed by organ, riffing piano, bass and drummer, plus occasional electric guitar licks. 6.) A Latin American standard is an allegory about a dove hesitant to embark on migration. Miss Valente was able to speak twelve languages!  SIDE ONE [3:15] Lazy River - Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong [3:22] The Everlasting Arms - Doris Day [3:43] Ximeroni - Nana Mouskouri [3:01] La Vie est une Belle Fille - Maurice Chevalier [2:28] First Star I See Tonight - Patti Page [3:24] All of Me - Ella Fitzgerald  SIDE TWO [2:46] Je M'Imagine - Edith Piaf [2:31] When You Belong to Me - Nat 'King' Cole [3:51] Greensleeves - Anne Shelton [3:33] Adonde Vas, Nio? - Luis Alberto Del Parana y su trio Los Paraguayos [4:17] Nobody But You, Lord  - Mahalia Jackson [2:32] La Golondrina - Caterina Valente  TOTAL TIME: 38:43
0	Love it, another great KIss song
0	Pretty good orchestras playing really good music very well. No doubt there are better recordings available but this is worth the bucks.
0	Great
0	Music somewhat variable in quality. MP3s are basically mid-fi. But at the price, still a super bargain! Have shopped Amazon for years, never been dissapointed.
0	The Pretty Reckless Light Me Up is a very good rock CD with 11 songs and full of emotions that everyone can relate to.  The singer's voice is also very good and on most songs you will feel like humming along or singing along in your car or at home.  Track one expresses the effects of drugs on the singer's life, track two another good rock song with decent lyrics but personally prefer the live version found on the CD single "Hit Me Like A Man."  Track 3 is a song you can't help but sing along to and relate to the lyrics at some point in your life "I'll Never Be Good Enough", track 4 is a song with strange lyrics but the singer is right about one main thing no matter how much we desire to change "Can't Be Anything Else But Me."  Track 5 is another song you can hum along to and enjoy moving to the music but in the end she will get her revenge on those who hurt her, track 6 shows how much you want to numb out the pain, hurt, so you take anything to drown it out but for "Just Tonight."  Track 7 shows how fast fame, fortune comes to your life, and then in blink of an eye it's turns you into "Miss Nothing, track 8 is a song about the singer looking for her hero to save her from 'Going Down."  Track 9 is another song about trying to fill the void in your life but this time trying to find it in love, religion, or even fame in the form of "Rock and Roll", track 10 threw the pain and sorrow you need that special someone to help you get threw it and keep you going.  Last track 11 is a feel good song about enjoy life and having fun by trying to get into the parties and you can move to the music bob your head or body threw the song start to end.
0	I Heart Yoko Ono.  This is a really nice remix short of her new single.  Well done, well mixed, fun to listen to.
0	Kem's lyrics are haunting.  His melodies take you back.  This is classic soul.  Love songs.  In love.  Out of love.  Hurting for love.  Dying for love.  Living for love.  Kem handles all with enormous talent. His voice can break a word just at the right point and send you into the pain or ecstasy of love.  There is not a weak track on this CD.  For anyone looking for the next generation of Soul music, this is a must have.
0	Nice beat
0	Not usually what I listen to, but I like most of the songs on this album. I first heard it on Spotify and decided after a few listens that I wanted to financially support Ms. Cara. ;)
0	What a beautiful song with a great message for young girls.
0	Absolutely LOVE the new single and can't wait for Sway to be released in August!!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE BLUE OCTOBER!!!
0	fun song
0	Just in my opinion Bruno Mars is one of the best singers I like almost everyone of his songs. Good Job Bruno Mars!
0	As a long-time fan of Queensryche, I was vapid with anticipation when I heard of the release of this album.  The marketing for it was virtually non-existant, and I actually discovered the album had been released when I  ran across a guitar transcription for "I Am I." The first  listen, for me, was a bit of a disappointment.  I was really expecting  another "Empire" (and hoping for another "Operation:  Mindcrime"), and this album is DEFINITELY not either one.  However, a  strange thing happened when I listened to it several more times.  I found  myself almost mesmerized by the eerie music and haunting vocals.  The band  took a change of direction, but it was a good change. Simply speaking,  this album is a work of art.  It is superb.  Buy this album, and give it a  FEW listens; you will not be disappointed.
0	I love most versions of this song. I want it played at my wedding. A A A A AA A
0	I've been a fan of Clay Aiken for a long time.  His rendition of Winter Wonderland is perfect to my Christmas song collection.  It has just the right happy uplifting beat.
0	All very well thanks
0	By Bill Binkelman Zone Music Reporter Full Review  Michele Ippolito's debut recording,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mystic-Moods/dp/B000EBFW0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mystic Moods</a>, came seemingly out of nowhere in 2005 and garnered impressive reviews, including the following praise from me; "There is a rich emotional resonance permeating all the pieces on Mystic Moods despite the presence of so many overt electronic components in the music...Michele Ippolito's debut CD is one of the best first efforts I have heard in years. It's near impossible to believe that she is a newcomer." About the only knock on her first recording was its short length of thirty minutes. In The Clouds clocks in at twice that in duration and, like Mystic Moods, it's filled to the brim with soothing lush electronic soundscapes that wrap around the listener like a feather-light down comforter. This CD would make an ideal soundtrack for watching the sun set amongst a sea of clouds, the sky going from blue to gold to purple and eventually to smooth velvety darkness with pinpricks of stars dotting the inky black sky.  Some reviews mentioned a palpable and recognizable similarity to Liquid Mind's music present on Mystic Moods. On first listen to In The Clouds, one might be tempted to repeat that assertion, but just as I stated in my Mystic Moods review, there are plenty of subtle and even not so subtle differences coursing through Ippolito's music which distinguishes it from Chuck Wild's (Liquid Mind). In The Clouds actually hews closer to a blend of new age and classic spacemusic, while the Liquid Mind series has, in more recent years, featured a strong neo-classical element (more sampled orchestral instruments, such as solo woodwinds).  As far as comparisons go, the track "On Skylark's Wings" reminds me of Jon Mark's Asia Journey, owing not just to the synthesizers used but also a hint of Asian motifs via plucked strings. "Dreamstar," the next song on In The Clouds, brings to mind Robert Haig Coxon's The Inner Voyage with its soothing flowing melody played on a variety of keyboards and buoyed by haunting angelic chorals. There is also a hint of Llewellyn scattered in amongst some tracks, such as "Reflections," although the almost omnipresent abundance of chorals makes the comparison somewhat tenuous, I admit. Yet another comparison (which I pointed out in my Mystic Moods review) is with Larry Kucharz, but Ippolito takes much less of a minimalist approach than Kucharz does, preferring to keep the music flowing non-stop on each track.  Ippolito also introduces some new wrinkles on In The Clouds, such as the lilting flute on "Horizon" (this elicits yet another comparison, that being to English artist Mike Simmons, who frequently blended layers of keyboards with sampled wind instruments). "Celestial Voices," likewise, sounds "new" to me with delicate plucked harp joined by high pitched chorals and not as many other synthesizers in the mix as on other cuts.  The variety that becomes evident as one delves deeper into the CD is a sure sign that Ippolito is maturing and growing as an artist. While there can be little denying that In The Clouds is cut from the same cloth as Mystic Moods, that statement could be made about many artists in this genre (i.e. albums frequently contain an artist's musical "signature"). Still, when I listened on headphones, I was surprised by just how (a) "new" and (b) varied the music on this recording is. Obviously, if you play it in the background and very softly, you may not hear the same degree of change that I do.  The whole issue of "new" versus "the same" not withstanding, what In The Clouds does contain, with out a doubt, is a collection of peaceful calming electronic new age music pieces, a sixty-minute musical tonic for de-stressing from the insanity that most of our day-to-day lives have become. Michele Ippolito proves that she is no one-hit wonder with this strong and accomplished sophomore effort. Solidly recommended.
0	May it give you the courage to walk out in waters that are not familiar and your trust is only in God.
0	This is music that you can understand.  The music told a story.  Very easy to listen to.  What a voice!  Johnny Miestro, one of a kind....
0	The digital download sounds as great as the original recording.  Just this one track was needed, not the entire album, so you can't beat the price and convenience.
0	Saw these two in Madison on the Swimmin' Time tour, and fell in love. This is a great CD. Folky / country / creole / lovey dovey duet. You won't be sorry.
0	sweetmotherlovingchrist.  i like f-minus and all, but honestly, leftover cra...i mean crack rock steady seven...are amazing.  they re-do the remade "So You Wanna Be A Cop?" on here.  it's the best version of course.  but if you want to hear the original and the remake you should get "This Is No Time Ta Sleep" - Morning Glory right now.  but back to this, f-minus is good cali-street punk, but like i said, crackrocksteadyseven blows them out of the water.
0	Hey...60 yr old Bullwinkle fan here. Tired of some of the numb-noids pulling moves in front of you in traffic? Put this on....relax...and think of the pleasure you had as a kid watching Bullwinkle. I'm sure this has prevented "road-rage" in a couple of cases with me.
0	At this man's INCREDIBLE creativity and talent!!! I was actually floored by it!!! Mr Lerin is EXTREMELY intelligent as a composer, and leaves one wondering as to what magical sound is going to come out of his guitar. Completely unexpected, surprising, and absolutely wonderful.
0	Love this song.  Ginny Owens rocks it.
0	Best lyrics of all the Christmas songs out there
0	Great smoky vocals by Angela McClusky!!! Very bluesy. Sounds great!!! Can't wait to check out the other songs on this soundtrack!!!

0	I have this album and it's over 30 years old.  I had been hoping to find it digitally.  Nice to see she did make it onto CD format.
0	After listening to this song on the radio, I had to buy the whole album. This is now one of my favorites I will be looking forward to in the future.
0	Timeless classic
0	great tune and transaction
0	This is such a great song!  I didn't realize how much I like Bruno Mars until recently, he is really a great artist and I'm catching up on all the songs I've missed, plus learning the new ones!
0	came in perfect condition; it was early as well!
0	Just LOVE Ambrosia!!!!!
0	I purchased Fifty Shades of Gray the Classical Album, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to purchase this CD.  It is so relaxing and I take it with me to work to listen to as I work at my desk.  It is truly a great CD and I highly recommend it.  I think it's THE BEST CD I've bought all year...now to get back to either reading or working...GET THE CD :-)
0	Master of the guitar
0	Nicole C. Mullen music from this c/d is thee best inspirational music that I have listen to for months on the way to work. Her spirit is beautiful. One of my friends was playing her c/ds in her store and I said who is singing this? I fell in love with her music and so did many of my friends! I have bought 3 of her c/ds so far...
0	Beautiful Song.
0	Great song and message
0	Such a great singer!! Really enjoy his CD. Well worth buying and great as for giving as a gift. Anyone would enjoy it
0	Wow!  I am in love with this album!  I have played it over and over and over and over.  I can't get enough of it.  I am a fan of P!nk's but this is different from anything she has ever done before.  I didn't know who Dallas Green was until I got this CD.  Their voices meld together like chocolate syrup on ice cream.  Some duos are meant to sing together - that is definitely the case here.  I hope they will put out another CD at some point in the future.  I really like all the songs but when I listen to Track 06 (Unbeliever) it reminds me of Gram Parsons & Emmy Lou Harris in the day that their voices melded together so wonderfully.  Wonderfully crafted songs that are complex and the harmonies are fabulous.
0	Another great CD by Rae Denton with Jackie Denton also performing.  Love the music and will enjoy listening to it so much.
0	I remember this song from way back when and it is still just as good now. Brings back so many memories.
0	I love their music when I need to stay up beat
0	One of my favorites from this band.
0	Love the Dubliners, and the song is excellent.
0	Rufus Crisp is a mountain music banjo player from Kentucky. This album is said to of been recorded between 1946 and 1955 when Rufus passed on. This is some of the very few recordings from a classic good time banjo player, who plays in the Kentucky vein, similar to Bill Cornett, Roscoe Holcomb, and James Crase. Rufus is different from his peers i have named, he has a slow relaxed story telling style of playing. He is definitely not as unique as Roscoe, but the relaxed Rufus Crisp makes all these tunes easy listening. We get his take on Old Joe Clark, Cumberland Gap, Shady Grove and a few personal story's from Rufus. Some of the best old-time and banjo music is from the hills of Kentucky and Rufus is a great example of this sound. This is a more than worthwhile document in the history of true American folk.
0	great music!
0	Cher is great, Cher is good, let us thank her for her hair, Amen. I wanted to be Cher. The only problem was, I was fat, short and a boy. A boy trapped inside a redneck, Baptist environment. I would go in my room and shut the door, wrap a towel on my head for hair and sing to her albums, over and over until either, one of my brothers or father would come in, with great disgust and no eye contact, unplug my record player(Do you know what a record player is children?)
0	Great voice love the songs
0	I'm sure everything's already been said.  This musical got my kids interested in music, rap, and history, plus 10 months after I received it as a gift, we still can't stop listening.
0	Not sure why I like the song, but I do. Great addition to my song library.
0	terrific

0	A very strong set of songs, both lyrically and melodically.  And Robin is in good voice throughout.
0	Why are they so lonely... they rock. this song rocks. buy this song. rock it out. love live it or leave it
0	We have all of Rod's "American Songbook" albums.  Never liked him as "Rod the rocker!"  But he does a terrific job belting out the old classics.  Also has a top notch orchestra behind him.  If you liked "Rod the Rocker", you may be disappointed, but if you like the old classics you will really enjoy these songs.

0	This is a great song; I used to tell a friend long ago that I wanted it played at my memorial service. Beautiful, moving.
0	Jackie Wilson's classical training (which he credited to Billie Ward - probably referring to the head of the 50s group The Dominos that Jackie belonged to - who had studied music at Julliard and did work as a vocal coach) - is brought to bear on on this tune borrowed from Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto - it's an impressive performance that blends opera with pop more successfully than the attempt made 20 years earlier when the melody was used for the pop tune "Tonight We Love"  Jackie is a favorite of mine - and this performance is one of my favorites of his (along with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Higher-Higher/dp/B001A7HBZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Higher & Higher</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Lonely-Teardrops/dp/B004I11RFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lonely Teardrops</a>)
0	One of the best Christmas duo's to bring the Christmas spirit for the season. Great voices and a great classic beat
0	Patricia has a quality to her voice that transcends the normal beauty of a voice - even a mature voice. In her case at the age of 13 or 14, she is awesome! I am so happy that she is going on to professionally study opera instead of wasting her time on lessor forms of vocal music. She is a beautiful young lady who seems determined to focus her talents so someday, we will be attending professional operas and be able to listen to her clarity of presentation.
0	Live in Australia is the best music I've ever owned.  Ryan and Neil combined are the best anywhere.  I listen to it every day, every single day.
0	this cd was purchased for my dads 95th birthday party. this cd has many more classic songs and most enjoyable. people just loved this type of music selection for the party. my dad had a wonderful  time going down memory lane listening to the music.
0	I loved the duets even some of the repeats.  How very special.
0	Classic throwback pop song. Great acoustic vibe and bass line. America, not known for a long string of hits but hit this one out of the park.
0	I cannot think of how this album could have been any better.  More than evolutionary, perhaps revolutionary.  This is a must have album for EVERYONE.
0	The one question that seems to haunt singer Tracy Nelson--and really throughout her career--is simply, "Why isn't she better known."  Actual stardom is a fickle thing, of course, and I'm not sure I'd wish it on anyone (anyone with actual talent, I mean), but couldn't a mega-talent like Tracy Nelson have at least as much recognition as, say, Bonnie Raitt or Maria Muldaur (similarly eclectic artists with whom Tracy has collaborated in the past)?  I used to ponder such questions a lot.  Now I'm just grateful that Tracy has had a long and varied career, is highly esteemed by her peers and beloved by her cadre of devoted fans.  Except for a decade long dry spell in the '80s (at least in terms of being able to land a record deal), she has remained prolific, if relatively unheralded, since the mid-'60s. Longevity counts for a good deal in the music biz: flash and trash can sell for a few years, but if you don't have the goods, don't expect a 40+ year career.  Speaking of the '60s, that was indeed an era when you really COULD make a career out of being truly eclectic.  Nobody minded that the Beatles dabbled in every conceivable musical genre, so why they should have had any kind of issue with a (then) up and coming talent like Tracy Nelson and her band Mother Earth, who trafficked mainly in good ol' all-American musical styles like rock, blues, C&W and a tinge of jazz, makes no sense.  Except that it was probably a headache for marketers, who really like to keep it simple, so after that historically brief period of experimentation, record companies regained control.  In the late '60s, Columbia Records (a company Tracy would later record for) came up with the absurd-on-its face motto, "The Man Can't Bust Our Music"--'ceptin' of course that they WERE the Man and they pretty much did.  Flash forward 40 years to Tracy's newest project, the genre-specific VICTIM OF THE BLUES and one thing becomes quite clear.  If Tracy Nelson had not posessed such a wide-ranging musical sensibility and if she HAD opted to stick to one musical genre and if that genre happened to be THE BLUES, no one would have had much cause to complain.  On her bluesier sides, Nelson has always exhibited a remarkable sense of assuredness and authority.  Hers is a voice just built for the blues, and while she'll sometimes in conversation, point to a musical colleague, such as her good friend and collaborator Angela Strehli, as being the "embodiment of the blues," when you hear how Tracy herself just inhabits the classic blues numbers included on this album, you suspect that she's being almost too modest.  In short, among contemporary blues artists, Tracy Nelson is second to none.  One thing that's evident on this album (yeah, I still call 'em albums), is that Tracy is a varied within the blues idiom as she is when she's genre-hopping.  There is no redundancy on this record.  And no overkill!  It's widely acknowledged among those in the know (and the cognoscenti, as well) that Tracy Nelson possesses one of the most powerful voices in the industry.  But she has also always used her vocal powers sparingly.  Tracy pulls out the stops on occasion here--most notably on the album's closer "Without Love," a duet with John Cowan.  But on other classic numbers such as the opening track Howlin' Wolf's "You'll Be Mine," she demonstrates genuine restraint, punching things up here and taking little vocal jabs there, but only hinting at her full power at this point, keeping the full force of her vocals for later.  The record is perfectly sequenced, to the point that you'll lose something of its flow should you opt to play it on random select.  Contrary to popular (mis)perception, the blues is a genre that's full of wit, wordplay and wry humor.  Tracy has managed to uncover a number of tunes with that emblematic humor, including the CD's second and third tracks (see, sequencing is important) "Lead A Horse to Water" and "Shoot My Baby," the latter a fun and funny duet with the wonderfully sly Marcia Ball.  These numbers set you up for the album's first torchy tour de force "It's A Sin."  Early influences are always given their due on any blues oriented project Tracy involves herself in.  When she conjures up Ma Rainey on the title track, Tracy sounds authentic: no mere imitator, she has absorbed her influences and their tradition completely.  You can say the same about Howlin' Wolf (whose "Howlin' For My Baby," she also covers to good effect), to say nothing of Muddy Waters ("One More Mile"), Percy Mayfield ("Stranger In My Hometown") and Joe Tex.  But what matters most is that, unlike so many of her 60s contemporaries, Tracy Nelson is no blues "wannabe."  She's the real deal, and she's earned the critical and fan acclaim she continues to receive after 40 years in the business.  Now the only question is: will the broader public finally catch on?
0	Bruno is a Master at his craft...!!
0	The collection is quite beautiful. Don't know why Over the Rainbow is in it, but it somehow seems to fit. Also gave as a gift. Would purchase all of their music.
0	Awesome. Love it so much its permanently in my cars CD player. Fast delivery from Amazon.
0	Memories of a time long ago!
0	One if the best soundtrack albums ever.
0	great!
0	Now with more cowbell and Guitar Hero hits. I rate this playlist 5 stars, as even though I was only born in 1985, this brings back memories of the early 2000's when I discovered this music through plastic guitars, a Wii, and Saturday Night Live.  All those fans that think this is good music just because they discovered it through free Amazon Prime are posers. All the real fans discovered this at least 10 years ago.
0	Listened to both cds and it was everything I expected and more.  Paul McCartney did it again.  Gave us the classics we love.
0	This is a song dreamed up quickly in a bar - or so the story goes. But the result is an engaging set of lyrics retelling the story of ol' Roland, complete with African wars, mercenaries, CIA assassinations, and then, well, at least one headless thompson gunner. The music is just as interesting and is not overmastered.
0	A nice smooth song with a meaning.
0	Funny satire about nazi's and wwII. Two inept producers, greed, the worst play ever written, turned into a musical. It's a goof.
0	Marie Osmond's voice is pure and fresh, so reminiscent of Karen Carpenter. I'd recommend this one for anyone who loves the Osmonds.
0	This song is so amazing, it will instantly switch your mood, for a better one, it's so soothing, relaxing, it's completely different than all this crap we hear nowadays... make sure to check out Ryan's other songs. He is truly an artist.
0	Michael adds authenticity to a standard.
0	My thang!
0	I like this CD especially the CD case. It's a real work of art.  Smaller than the LPs of old but very nicely done.  The cut outs and tasteful use of metallic ink make it better than anything I've seen in a while.  I listen closely to the little things like stereo field positioning and the tone and balance of the instruments in the field, especially the low end. There are some songs that I like better than others. The ones I like, the instruments seem to breathe more naturally, where some other songs sound a bit over compressed like some of his older work.  Joe has sprinkled in some new licks to his usual bag of tricks and also some new effects here and there. I especially like how the guitar fade out echoes are recorded. I also like the quality of amplification for all instruments.  Joe and the producers have a good ear for distortion done right.  I'm not a fan of any kind of cymbal or snare banging the beat that's loud and up front. Too hard on my ears and blood pressure.  It's not on every song so I compromise when it shows up.  I have most all of Joe's catalog. I know he's a really talented musician and I'd be more inclined to buy his next CD if I knew he was exploring new sonic territories to expand my musical boundaries over delivering the same old formula.
0	Love this song
0	So yeah this song seemed to start it all for Lady Antebellum although Need You Now got most of the radio play.
0	Words do not do this song justice. It will get you through your darkest hours. Thanks Johnny, From up the there the view must be magnificent.  Addict77 Aka Frank Keedy
0	Perfect. Well written and plays well. But the description needs to explain what a Name Day is first. How many others did he write?
0	The Pretenders do this song prefection.  I listen to Christie many times a day.  It makes my day relaxing. Very present.
0	Really good CD
0	Wake up to this song every morning and it always puts a smile on the faces of my kids and me.
0	rock still lives!  this is a great song and doesn't have any rap garbage mixed in with it.  Just good rock,
0	The music is great. I would recommend this to everyone. Bruno Mars is so awesome and the quality is exceptional.
0	Man with this album, one way I can describe it is it gets better everytime you listen to it. Like my favorite tracks last week ain't my favorite tracks this week. This album from 1 to 17 is amazing. This is gonna be an album 10 years from now all the people that were lucky enough to hear this will always and I mean always have this in high regard. If I had to pick a favorite track it would be "The Book Of Soul". One of the best songs I ever heard and I grew up on hip-hop from the '90's and this album should go right up there with all the classics from 94 and 95. It's that good. Check it out.
0	I've been enjoying this song for about a month now and wanted it for my playlist. It will probably become a song that is played every summer. Smart move Calvin Harris.
0	Go Bob!
0	Suprised at number of good songs on here.  Should get more samplers ! Amazon offers a ton of these for download
0	Very pleasant song. I love the piano licks towards the end. Should sound good on AC radio.
0	Great James Taylor.  Beautiful songs and still sings like so soulful.  Not the lightning in a bottle he captured with "Fire and Rain" and those early albums, but always wonderful to have James Taylor in my ears.
0	Her best CD yest! And that is saying something. "Wherever is Your Heart",, "The Eye" and "Things that I Regret" are the the best three songs on the CD (first three ... funny about that?). It's a typical and smart approach to song layout on an album- put your best stuff at the top to draw listeners in. No criticism from me - I think she's great and can do no wrong - I saw Brandi C live at the world famous MSG a few months back and this album performed live is phenomenal. If you have the chance to see her - do it! If you are hesitating about buying this CD? Don't!
0	I'm just discovering this album, albeit years and years after it was released. Familiar with Mark's work from the Rippingtons, and from his first solo project, "No Truer Words," which was stellar. If all of this record is as spectacular as "Pleasure" I'll be playing this as much as his previous work.
0	Yes she does!  Can't possibly sit still listening to this great classic! How many movies has this song appeared in???
0	I like Natalie Merchant and this song is one of her best.  I would highly recommend this song to anyone.
0	I picked this up as I'm a big fan of Nick D'Virgilio and supporter of all from the Spock's Tree. Excellent drumming along with great melodies and vocals. Nice keyboard and guitar work and a warm sounding production make this one of my favs.
0	A cover of Peter Schilling's song. I really liked the song, I found it very catchy.  Music preferences are in the opinion of the individual listener, so in my opinion, it is a very energetic and exciting song.
0	awesome album!
0	Good
0	Still have this same vinyl album I'd purchased 40 years ago, when I was 16 years old.  Part of the soundtrack of my life.  I actually learned quite a few things about adding expression into my own playing while listening to Freddie at about this time.  His ballad playing was decidedly different from that of Miles, Brownie, or Lee.  His playing was full of the emotion of youth: active and vibrant, yet lush, fluid and thickly sweet, like honey.  Though searching, I hadn't been able to find this album, specifically for these two songs, available digitally anywhere until now.  Even with my more mature ear, "You" and the track "Touching You" on this album are just as beautiful now as they were then.  Many top tier jazz musicians had used string orchestrations on recordings (of admittedly far more substance) in the decades prior to these tracks, but I believe that Freddie and Stanley's homage to those earlier ballads actually salvaged this album, with an outpouring of emotion in their performances here.  Only problem for me was that their solos on these two tracks were too short, and like the rest of my early horn playing heroes, they're now gone...
0	RCA's "Fabulous Swing Collection" was released to exploit a national big band revival craze, led by groups like Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Brian Setzer's Orchestra and in full swing (pardon the pun) in 1998. That revival has cooled but this generous (19 songs, 65 minutes) set remains among the era's better one-disc compilations (all songs from RCA family labels)  for now third-generation fans. It may not have been all the classics revivalists danced to; two swingin' Louises (Prima and Jordan) recorded their jump, jive and wailin' big band tunes for Capitol and Decca Records, respectively. But many of the era's signature tunes are represented, sounding surprisingly warm in analog sound: Glenn Miller's anthemic "In The Mood," "String of Pearls," and "American Patrol," Benny Goodman's hard, wild swinging "Sing, Sing, Sing" (heard recently and famously in a cookie commercial but better in Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall concert), Cab Calloway's 1933 "Minnie The Moocher," which he performed nearly a half-century later in the first "Blues Brothers" film and here does in full-throated youthful yodel. You also get seminal sides from Charlie Barnet ("Cherokee"), Tommy Dorsey ("Marie," "Opus One"), and Duke Ellington ("Take The 'A' Train," "Cotton Tail"). While these songs swing sweeter than 1998's martini-and-cigar crowd might have liked, "Fabulous" may well be among the few big band CDs a new fan would need. Longtime fans have these classics on the artists' original LPs (or more studious sets like Columbia's "16 Most Requested Big Band Themes") and can probably swing past it.
0	All American Nightmare shows growth with Austin and Cody from Hinder in their song writing.  This albumn is deeper and more complex than Extreme Behavior and Take It To The Limit.  They combine Steven Tyler, G n R, and some cool rifts that smack of 38 Special w/ a twang of country rock.  This albumn totally takes me back to the 80's when rock was really rock.
0	I love Ronnie Radke. Heavy, heart-felt, and overall real.  You have to listen to this album.  Falling in Reverse are the perfect answer for those of you looking for that indefinable conglomerate of musical genres. Ronnie or crew...if you see this, i would love a free t-shirt.
0	I really enjoyed this CD. Yes their music is different, but they are still my favorite band. They're maturing. I usiallybuy CDs from Amazon because of the autorip. I love listening to CDs in the car and then love listening wherever I am on my phone without using internet. However when I bought this CD from Amazon the autorip didn't show. I had hoped Amazon was just delayed in offering, but nothing yet. I would have bought the CD elsewhere because the threshold for shipping is also now greatly higher.
0	We love listening to this CD.  I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old and they sing and dance along to all the songs.  Plus the CD has a bonus DVD so you can watch all the songs on TV.  Great buy!!!
0	Awesomeness!!! ((d-_-b))
0	My daughter loves this movie franchise, and loves the C.D's. A great bonus is the words inside the booklet provided.
0	This is amazing, timeless music from the Bee Gees. Those who only know the 70s disco Bee Gees may not realize how truly talented they were in the early days. This is a must-have.
0	If you are an O'Jay fan will love this one ...the whole album a hit
0	I think this song is worth listening to. It sounds great. For those who like Third Eye Blind, they will like this and for those who don't like their songs on the radio, this is different. It has a powerful message to it about friendship and being there for someone as they loss themselves to a painful life experience. There is a lot that can be related to and it is a beautiful song.
0	Jovial song. Very catchy.
0	I bought this item back in 2012, but finally got around to listening to it. What a great album. Such a different direction they took from their other albums. The change is terrific and the music, outstanding! If you want a great album to listen to this would be the one. A word of caution; this album will have you dancing from beginning to end it's that great!
0	I think Cassadee will be the first winner in the Voice to be actually successful. Her First single sounds amazing, catchy and emotional. Please listen for samples. If you like it. Please buy her music. She will amaze you.
0	Really wonderful songs!
0	Great addition to my collection.  This is a song I'd forgotten about until recently.  If you like 90's music then you'll like this. Even though it's not that old it fits the period of great alternative.
0	We've all been there.  All of us.  I'm talking about hard times.  Sure, we try to be zen about life.  "Don't get too high, don't get too low."  But sometimes, you just can't achieve that balance no matter how hard you try.  I came across this free download merely by accident.  When I saw the cover art, I told myself that this was a moment... a moment for pause.  I went on to download the free track only to find not only a pensive, reflective tune... but myself.  I put "Tell Me Who I Am" on repeat that night.  I didn't sleep a wink, because the lyrics and melodies haunted me and forced me to look within myself.  What I found wasn't always pretty, but it was honest.  Sanjaya, I can't tell you who you are.  Only you, and you alone, can do that.  That's what your song taught me.  As for me, thanks to your song, I know exactly who I am now.  Thank you.
0	Truly a masterpiece.
0	The music is beautiful, joyful! It brings one into the presence of God. Its great when one is stressed, upset, sad, or confused, as it fills one with peace, courage, strength, hope and joy!  I highly recommend it!
0	I purchased the song I Love the Lord by Whitney Houston to have a spiritual uplifting song on my kindle.  Whitney Houston's voice is strong and undeniable - Her talent is unquestionable and this song and her voice together are so powerful and emotional - I love them both
0	I really think that the people on this remix make it a good song to listen to and it is unique how all of the artist use their talents.
0	I love the product,very nice!!
0	The Spinners released this song on one of their albums during the Disco and Funk era. I think this is one of the Spinners' best performances. The sound is quite good.
0	Kellie has a great voice and is a wonderful country singer.  My only regret is that she hasn't recorded more music for me to enjoy.
0	Was a gift...great set
0	Everything Miss Ronstadt sings is wonderful, never a disappointment.  I thoroughly an enjoying listening to this recording. The songs are to notch.
0	I have been getting into "Chill" music lately - It reminds me of a song you might hear in a movie - like The Italian Job (2nd one).  Some electronic with full instruments.  When I want to listen to some music while working or just thinking of other stuff - good instrumental music fits the bill.
0	If you are a fan of Jackie Evancho, then this song will not let you down.  Jackie Evancho has a way of taking songs and putting her own twist on in. Safe and Sound has a nice vocal range with nice musical intstuments to back up her voice. There is a nice beat carried thorugh the song and her voice just carries the melody with such sweetness.  I am a huge fan of Jackie Evancho's voice. Safe and Sound is such a pleausre to listen to.
0	Well I downloaded this months ago and now it's all over commercials too, I guess I know a good beat.  It's a great song!
0	The big dance # from Unaccompanied Minors movie. Watch it with my son every Christmas.
0	Exquisite rendition of this great music. A blow your mind cd.
0	I chose this song for it's soft sound for putting on my Mom's MP3 for her to use as music to sllep by.  I know it will bless her & help her to sleep better!!!
0	Always a favorite & priced nice for adding to your library of songs. It won't disappoint, that's for sure, thanks Rod.
0	I love this group!  The song is great and upbeat!  I have liistened to it so much I know it by heart.
0	Great music!
0	I love this song
0	Great son from him.
0	Really good, but not great.  Love all the selections.  Willie is my favorite he changed the world of music many years ago for the better.
0	I listened to quite a few different recordings of this song before I chose this one. I liked this one the best. Yes, I would recommend it.
0	This is a wonderful rendition of Canon and one of my favorites.  Canon has always been joyful and this piece almost pushes it to cheerful at some points, but tastefully.  Then it relaxes and rounds out nicely.  It really deserves a higher quality recording and an MP3 at 320 kpbs - that would make it a 5 star purchase for me.
0	I love listening to this cd because it is so calming and relaxing. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes the sound of singing bowls.
0	I have recently discovered the Benedictines of Mary Queen of Apostles and their superb sacred music. Sacred music, as intended by its many composers, creates an otherworldly experience. The Benedictines take sacred music well beyond that. One feels he/she is in the company of angels. The music has extraordinarily beautiful harmony and delivers a great message - to both believers and, I am sure, non-believers. One cannot help but be deeply touched by these nuns and what they have produced.  The album producer transports you directly to the Benedictine's chapel where the music was recorded. Each album captures the spirit of these prayerful, contemplative nuns.  I suspect that listeners, once introduced to the Benedictines and their music, will not stop with the purchase of one album.
0	This British band has their own sound going on! The closest I come to describing their psychedelic indie sound, would be to compare them to great retro-rockers, such as The Stone Roses! This band is original, so I would give them a six star rating! Thanx!
0	One of the best male groups back in the day
0	Absolutely love these CDs.  My 3 year old dances and sings along with them.  What a wonderful way to hide the Word in our hearts.
0	This album is beautiful i love the keke she is so talented deserves a grammy
0	I am a big fan of John Mayer.  This cd is the best ever.  Every song is an honest account of life and love of life.  I listen to every song over and over and it makes me feel good to be alive.  Thank you John for saying it like it is!
0	I downloaded this sampler album from Amazon out of curiosity, and because I liked the picture of the cat on the cover. What I expected is to hear native American flute music without any accompanying instruments or sound effects. I like to hear any ethnic music in more or less its original form. Since this is a sampler, the album consists of different artists. Some pieces on the album are great and minimalistic, others not so much, which motivated me to give this only 4 out of 5 stars. A number of pieces contain the Spanish guitar. I like Spanish guitar, but not when it is mixed with native American music. Come on! How genuine is that?  Another gripe I have is almost every flute piece is modified to sound as if it playing at a concert hall, or in a big tunnel, you will always hear the amplified reflection effect of the instrument. I know that it was added using computer software and sometimes it is very appropriate, but with the wonderful music on this album I believe is severely overdone. Considering that there are forest sound effects added to the music, it is even less likely that you'd hear the distance amplification effect. If it were played inside a forest with leaves around, it would sound normal like if you're playing it inside a garage.  Despite what I have written above, don't miss out on this album. This is overall very nice. I think some people may find it good to calm down the nerves or meditate and just hard to find in general.
