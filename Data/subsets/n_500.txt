0	poor cd not very musically interesting
0	It was supposed to be the long version, but is not. Just wasted my money.
0	Her voice has been so auto tuned, that you can't even understand what she is trying to sing.  This is just horrible.
0	The songs? Brilliant. The pressing of the vinyl? Awful.
0	The Item was (its) broken
0	and all that's left are some clueless, punk wanna be/california, banal songs that don't even get close to the old TON dark, melodic psychedelic melancholy.....ehh. Waist of time and money by all means; and by the way pictured Rasputin have with all this talent less banging and simple lyrics?
0	A lot of noise bytes....most of them very similar to each other.  Not worth the purchase.  My own fault because I did not preview the sound effects prior to purchase.
0	It has the wrong name on the song, it is not The Bear Went Over the Mountain, It is about touching your fingers to your nose and toes.
0	Not funny, fitting title though. After listening to this album my depression returned. I was very close to committing suicide, then realized, my life was not half as bad as Joe's.
0	This song is utterly unrecognizable...is this even a Calvin Harris production? Oh I'm sorry, because I thought he sold out and became a creepy 50 year old Frenchman named David Guetta. And who is that god awful screecher doing the vocals?
0	Very short ... Not the whole song. Very disappointing. Amazon will not return music... A waste of $1
0	A disappointing film that ruins the meaning of a film adaptation!  While Josh Brolin is normally a great actor, he could not provide convincing acting when he played Jonah Hex.  Also, this film has poor makeup because Jonah Hex's scars are supposed to be more extensive while in this film, they toned down the scarring too much.  They could have at least used CGI to extend the scarring instead of trying to mess it up with old-fashioned makeup.  Another issue that came up in this film is the fact that Megan Fox and John Malkovich use the same acting style they use in all of their movies instead of altering their acting so that they seem more convincing and they would not look like emotionless robots trying to preach their lines.  In conclusion, this film is a complete disappointment to audiences everywhere.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Young-Guardians-and-the-Genesis-Spell/dp/1432743821/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Young Guardians and the Genesis Spell</a>
0	I think this record is getting way too much praise for this material that she put out.  I like the title song.  I am feelin that.  "Your Woman" and "Letting Down My Guard" are good songs to me. I also like "A Little Sunshine."  Simply for the fact that she can do something positive and not all of these "I love you..." and "I hate you..." songs, see "I Heard It All Before!"  Move on.
0	This soundtrack has NEVER been legitimately issued on CD.  It's a CD-R, not a pressed CD. Lindsay Buckingham himself (performer/author of the title track) has been questioned about the soundtrack and confirmed that it has never been legitimately issued.  Again: This soundtrack has NEVER been issued on CD ANYWHERE in the world. Never. Anywhere. This is a bootleg.
0	Sword and Staff / B0019UMH9W  It would be interesting to know what the intended audience for this song would be - I realize there are "Christian Wiccans", but I don't think they're a large percentage of the pagan community. With intones of "Maiden, Mother, and Crone... Father, Son, and Holy Ghost" meant to merge the three concepts, and with lines like "A spell is nothing but a prayer," I can think of fewer ways to quickly fall out with your coven than to bring this along without warning to your next circle gathering.  Tongue-in-cheek aside, this is not really a favorite track of mine. I love Heather Alexander's vocals, but the heavy "preachy" feel of this track just sort of turns me off, which is odd, because normally I strongly resonate with "coexist" themes in art and music. I guess what turns me off is because the song feels less like "differences are valuable and we should get along" and more like "there are no differences and people need to get that".  Said another way, I don't think there's anything wrong with saying, for instance, that prayers and spells are similar, or that the triple goddesses encompass many of the same concepts as the Christian trinity, but when you devote a whole song saying, over and over again, that only the words are different and everything is completely the same, it bothers me that there's no room for nuance or difference. I don't think that we should be defined by our theological differences, for that way lies only fractiousness, but I do think we shouldn't be told that those differences don't exist - the existence of difference is, I think, subjective between the participants, and not an objective truth to be doled out by a third party.  I digress. This is a very pretty song, and if you agree with the concepts contained in here, you'll probably enjoy it immensely. And I wouldn't consider it completely inappropriate for a circle gathering, as long as it's understood that this is just one opinion among many, and everyone is respectful of differing opinions. It's not really a "sing-along" song if you're just here for the filk music, though.  ~ Ana Mardoll
0	There was only one song on this CD that I liked.  Threw it out, it was not worth listening to so sorry.
0	Selfies are annoying enough, I don't see why an annoying song was necessary. The white girl voice in this song is SO UNBELIEVABLY annoying. I want to just smash my headphones. I mean yes, it has a catchy tune, but it is not the type of song that you spend money on. Look up on youtube, watch it once, and then never discuss it again.
0	What were they thinking? Played this thru a few times and just didn't get it. Would not recommend.
0	Here is our Mitch "allegedly" drugged out...and it is a shame to see all that talent hidden behind the high.  He's just not all there for his audience.  I listened to "Strategic Grill" right before "Do You Believe in Gosh" and the difference was so very plain and painful to hear.  God bless this man's soul; he was a true talent and a victim of the world of drugs that is taking and continues to take the best and brightest stars in all venues.  This CD was a big disappointment for this Mitch fan.  I only gave it two stars because this guy was an outstanding performer in his short-lived prime.
0	I use to be a huge NTWICM fan. I have 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, Now #1s, 21, 22, and 23. But this was before itunes really surpassed CD sales -- and before I really got into ipods and MP3s. But now people can buy music online or illegally download music. They no longer have to deal with album filler. The Series is no longer hot.
0	I've bought every record of Regina Spektor thus far and I usually burn the disc out by replaying and replaying till every line is stuck in my head. That just didn't happen this time. There were maybe one or two songs I liked but I didn't feel the same urge to replay the album.
0	I had heard this had been released. So glad amazon allows you to listen to parts of each song. They all sound the same. Techno junk. No singing. Obviously trying to capitalize on her 15 minutes. Needs to go back to cooking school. Don't waste your money.
0	I returned it.
0	And that's the exact problem with this album. No anger, no energy, that typical D4 anthemic sound has been sugar coated somehow to make it more appropriate for tracking a skate video they would be playing at Zumies. It's not punk it's bunk. Sorry dudes.
0	ugh
0	I placed this order around the 15th of January and when I received it, I realized it was the wrong one for this particular class.  I contacted the seller immediately who told me I could return the CD, yes I said CD when I contacted the seller.  I mailed it back that day.  It is now the 14th of Feb and to date I have not received a refund, however the seller did contact me after an inquiry I made to tell me they would not refund my money instead they would send the CD back.  Thiw was never mentioned in the initial contact I had with the seller when I explained that this was wrong, now however, this is their story.  I will not do business with this seller in the future, nor would I recommend that anyone else does.  I imagine they will sell this CD again and make money off someone else, since they made money off me already.
0	This features a pan flute much like recordings of Zamfir.  One of those things that you'll either love or hate!  Too schmaltzy for me!
0	S&*t Sandwich.
0	tired ass song
0	Save your money. This isn't even close to anything the lead singer did with McQueen Street. It's some bizarre sort of Alice In Wonderland themed album that left me with visions of minstrels & peasants dancing around a butter churner in some sort of Renaissance Fair hell. No rockers, not even a hint of the McQueen St that came before. I'm going to guess he was in some sort of coked out haze due to grunge killing McQueen Street's future, and this is the sad result. Listen at your own peril. If I could give this zero stars I would.
0	he is a really great singer but the production of the cd sucks. the cd skips and is very poor quality. i sent the first one back hoping it was an isolated event but the second cd came in skipping in different places than the first. i kept it because i couldn't get my money back. i hope he puts out a cd with a decent company.
0	Love this song and artist. He is the best 2 put u in the move. Easy 2 order and download.
0	in the past two weeks i've procured both this album and willie's live album from the late 70s with the family.  perhaps it's due to such a stark contrast with that earlier, energized and authentic performance that i find this album to be so remarkably unfulfiling.  depressing, actually. yes, "maria" is catchy and the title track isn't bad, but the guest stars intrude, the production smothers, and the albums sinks beneath its own bloat.  pity, really, as willie and his fans deserve better. to echo another reviewer, "across the borderline" covers the same concept in an infinitely more creative fashion; direct your attention there.  or almost anywhere else in willie's catalog for that matter.  and, of course, "willie and family live" is essential.
0	Apparently Lisa Loeb doesn't know any kids of color. Pretty oddly homogeneous-looking group of kids, considering the year we're in.  The songs and videos are not very engaging, either. My son loves music but he was bored by this and so was I.  p.s. This review is for the streaming video version that you can watch on Amazon prime video.
0	This is an original artist remake. If you want the original version of this song click here >&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/One-more-try/dp/B002SZ2Z80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">One more try</a>
0	This guy is most likely a rapist, sex offender, and member of ISIS. This comedian is a threat to the economy and political stability of the United States. Avoid at all costs.
0	I couldn't ever figure out how to download it.  The song itself I love:  I just can't listen to the one I bought.
0	Good thing this song and the others I downloaded were free. They don't tell you that if you don't click Amazon Downloader immediately after purchasing a song, the download expires and you don't get the song. The one song that did download, is invisible to iTunes anyway. So that free MP3 $5 bonus actually was just a disappointment. I wanted to give it a rating of no stars, but that is not a choice.
0	This is a wonderful collection of Bird's Birdland recordings. They are priceless, but some of these recordings have splices. For example, Anthropology from March 31, 1951. The second B section of Bird's solo it spliced out. On the out-chorus, there are two areas where 2.5 beats are dropped. This isn't true for the original LP on Columbia, so somewhere in the remastering things got screwed up. If you you want the solos for the Omnibook, you'll be disappointed by the omissions.  Unfortunately, other collections are overpriced nowadays. I haven't explored other re-releases for completeness.
0	When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
0	I'm a huge fan of Stephen Marley, but to  call this part II of Revelation is an insult to part I. This album is much more poppy with songs that were obviously created to cross over into other markets and be played in nightclubs. I usually end up skipping over most of the songs when they come up on my playlist.
0	Honestly, this album is no where near as good as the new one they put out last year "As it is on earth" - that album is a solid 4-5 stars!  This has one "hit" from the 90s but is no where near as creative as "as it is on earth"
0	This CD is not the same album I owned on vinyl or audiocassette. The original American HELP! album was both a Beatles album and a Soundtrack album. What happened to the instrumental tracks that Ken Thorne composed?  Those great instrumental tracks that were on the LP are missing? One of the central plot elements of HELP! was the satirical slant spoofing the James Bond-Spy phenomenon of that period! The music that Ken Thorne composed or adapted is now missing. The Beatles' songs interlaced with Thorne's instrumentals made for a great musical experience from the film. I objectively can only rate this based on the absence of this fantastically nostalgic material. This cover is not as good as the original in my opinion. The original was more intricate and detailed and was truly more a product of the film and the times. ....
0	I think this is her worst song ever...Blah! She is so talented, I can't fathom why she'd write such an incipid song as this.
0	Fantastic - I love it!!!
0	I bought this album several weeks ago.  When one use to walk past a carousel the bass drum would stir your insides and the sound was incredable.  In spite of an exotic sound system this album sounds as if it were recorded over the telephone.  Take a pass on it.
0	Not the best stuff from either artist
0	This is ok for this genre of music
0	It's ok don't really like the dramatization that they use. They tend to change the wording with out changing it.
0	which was zero. I'd rather listen to Eno's windows start up patch over and over.
0	Love album but sound is terrible can't believe the record company dropped the ball on such a good album
0	Not all that good. Sort of a self-indulgent record for the Continental Drifters. Better to get the original music by Richard Thompson and Linda Thompson.
0	DO NOT BUY Mp3!!!! Once you download it you have it for 24 hours and then it is gone! This has happened to me several times before. There have been a few songs that I have been able to keep, but this is irritating. How do you return a downloaded song!!!
0	When I first heard Chrisette's "If I Had My Way" I had to know who she was. I was so amazed at her talent, and thankful for the new Neo-Soul talent. Then can Epiphany and it has been downhill since then. She has sold out in the worst way and I am contemplating deleting this album from my iPod.
0	I really like this song but this version is a terrible copy of it. The sound quality is awful. Try buying one of the other "albums" it's featured on.
0	I don't like this song, and I do plan on deleting it, but I guess even so, I still have an opinion. In MY opinion, it's a single star for sure.
0	This arrangement was lifted straight from Jonathan Coulton, who wrote and performed a completely legal, ethical cover. FOX didn't even give him credit. Don't support these unfair business practices.
0	my taste has change over the years.i shouldn't bought it .its okay my mom loves it.go figure.she plays it alot.
0	The music is great! But the CD came cracked in four places :( I was so disappointed
0	Wasn't relaxing at all...It was very abrasive and disturbing to me.  This might be your cup of tea, but it wasn't mine
0	I thought I was purchasing the Brad Paisley and Dolly Parton version.  Unfortunately, this was just a very good cover rendition.
0	Save your money, don't buy Get Rich Or Die Tryin'. I'm only giving him one star because they won't allow me give him No star. 50 cent is simply an overrated scumbag that owes his success to Dre and Eminem. Plainly 50 is a FOOL!!!! Let's have a brief rundown of the messed up tracks on that album. 01-Intro : Coin dropping, indicating a 50cent coin, creative but STUPID. 02-What Up Gangsta : Great beat (thanks to d producers) Weak rhymes, lame lyrics, terrible song. 03- Patiently Waiting : 50 cent gets murdered by Eminem slick rhymes and captivating flow. when 50 begins to drop, song mood changes, and makes you want to skip the track. 04- Many Men : "YEPA! They want to kill me, many many men," Trash like that is what you will hear. All that over-muscled idiot talks about is getting shot. 05- In Da Club :"U can find me in the club." Am i looking for you? 06- High All The Time: Another senseless track with a great beat, but alas 50 cent's rapping screws up the track. He can never be the next best thing, excluding sales. 07- Heat : What the hell is this guy talking about 08-If I Can't : Another track with good instrumentals, fifty busts fairly well in this song, but still makes no sense. He seems to just pen what come into his head that rhymes, leaving him lacking a message. 09-Blood Hound : So terrible, I reserve my comments. 10-Back Down : Ja rule diss, weak rhymes, but and engrossing beat. 50 doesn't even intelligently diss Ja rule. He makes stupid statements like "You is a pop-tart sweetheart, you soft in the middle." 11-P.I.M.P : You heard it? What do you think? 12-Like My Style : Surely enough, another great beat, but still lyrically weak and lacking of meaning. 13-Poor Lil Rich : This song is so sickening i don't think i've ever heard it from A to Z. 50 is just tooo weak. 14-21 Questions : This man has been shot, stabbed, sent to jail, and he ends up rappin about stuff like "If i wrote u a love letter would you write back?" 15-Don't Push Me: Amazing beat, Eminem and Lloyd Banks drop some serious rhymes and flows in this one. But 50, though and improvement from other rhymers, he still can't match up to the other rhymes on this track 16- gotta make it to heaven : And this rate, he won't even make it to the gates. (Bonus) 17-Wanksta : You heard it ain't you? Notice the way the talked about a shawty and about then talks about his homeys and then disses a gangsta. This man has no focus on what he's rapping about. 18- U Not Like Me: Catchy Chorus, nice beat, okay rhymes. All in all , run from this CD. u can learn nothing from 50 as an aspiring rapper, but if you just want to dance, then by all means get this album
0	horrible remix.  What a racket.  Stole my money.  would never purchase again.  waste of money.  go look for the real song
0	I really like this song, but $1.29 is a THIRTY PERCENT increase in the price of music.  REFUSE TO PAY for these over-priced songs!  There are plenty still available at $0.99.  Tell the record companies WE WILL NOT PAY MORE!
0	What happened to this great artist?  The songs are so unworthy of him, his vocal musicianship, that it is a crime.
0	I selected  this rating because I wanted to be fair. The music is off don't sound like the original beat. These are good song but the beat to these songs are off. No; I would not recommend this to my friend
0	Description says "mint condition". For that, I would expect at the very least "playable".  realize I purchased a "used" product but this vinyl record skips terribly throughout every song on side 1 (Manic Monday, In a Different Light, Walking Down Your Street, & Walk Like an Egyptian. ALL SKIPPING so terribly it's not even listenable! Returning immediately.
0	Almost every track skips.
0	I tried and tried but I could never get this to play. Finally I gave up. There should be an easier way to locate a download or maybe it just never went through..don't know but I'd spent enough time fooling around with it so I gave up trying.
0	Do not like please remove
0	These guys stink, just like any so called "punk" rock today. Don't buy this.
0	Ugh.  Thats the first reaction I get every time I hear these talentless posers on the radio. The singers voice just irritates me beyond explaination and the band can't play. Did you know these guys are signed to Roadrunner records? The same label that has kick ass bands like Slipknot, Murderdolls, and Stone Sour? Sorry, but these fairies just don't fit in with those guys. I just wish all their loser fans would wake up and realize how much Nickleback suuuuuucks.  DustinX over and out!
0	I have never seen such a display of vulgar Liberal Jiberal entertainment. They think that they are so tough with their long hair and instruments that make noise. This band is a Liberal wacko band, and they need to stop with all of this nonsense hoopla joopa in this day and age.  Two hippies were walking by me and they were talking about the band. I told them tha they should not listen to it because it rots their brains with total garbage Liberal weirdo stuff.  DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!  GO REPUBLICAN!!!!
0	Deleted the songs. I have a woman friend that likedd it , I didn't care for him. Just personal taste
0	Is it just me or does this just sound like another Nickelback/Creed type ripoff tune?? Here at my job they have some crazy a$$ satellite radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song. Give me one good reason why i should like this crappy song...
0	ok when it plays
0	It has this really odd way of playing the song. It's not the one you are use to hearing. don't get this one
0	Seriously?  This is what passes for edgy rock music these days?  This suffers from American Idol syndrome - yeah, they can copy the style but there's nothing of substance here.  It strikes the pose but doesn't draw a single drop of blood.  You can walk into the mall, blow a wad at Hot Topic, look all punk rock, but that don't make you a punk.  This sounds exactly like you'd expect from a rich LA actress who can afford to record in a top notch studio with good producers and engineers and, hey, if things don't work out, you just go back to your posh pad and wait for your agent to text you the next TV role.  L-A-M-E.  You wanna hear dark and dirty female fronted rock?  Check out some Concrete Blonde, 45 Grave, Legal Weapon... or for something more commercial but still much better, Joan Jett, Blondie, Berlin... kids, you're being sold an image here, nothing more.  The only difference between this and an Avril Lavigne album is the cover.
0	Not that good kind of juvenile very simple no head pounding face punching beats. Did not like at all..
0	I found this pathetic excuse for music in my son's cd player, and I was totally appalled! This cd has no good messages, no positive songs, nothing but extremely dirty language about group sex and violence. This is x-rated, pornographic dribble. Please people-Don't buy this... you'll only inspire more sickos like Boss Pimp to make more of this garbage. Keep our kids safe from Boss Pimp and his kind!
0	I do not like this some at all thought it was like th original but it is far from it!!
0	Again, another fake German Welle CD. 36 songs in all and they pretty much sound the same. The original artist flair is missing. Of course they failed to mention that in the add, so I assumed it may be the real thing.
0	Strickly a ballad album. Was greatly disappointed. What happened to Bryan Adams????
0	Not my cup of tea. Thought I'd listen to it since all the "five" stars.
0	An enthusiastic and rousing rendition to be sure, but the intonation is pretty awful - not even the pipe organ is in tune with itself!  Granted, this is (at least in part) a student ensemble, but the pitch is downright atrocious in parts and no better than sketchy for the duration.  Stay away from this recording unless (like I did) you got a $1 voucher for an mp3 purchase.  It's worth hearing for free...
0	Sounds like every othe hillsongy song. Good lyrics, but chourus so repetitive that it becomes mindless, annoying, and old very very fast.
0	I've really enjoyed other works they've done,  but was not as impressed with this one.
0	if you like time life christmas you'll love this, otherwise buy the time life christmas, better versions of all this music are available
0	This compilation does no justice to Isaac Hayes, his artistry or his visionary genius. Why? Isaac was an artist whose music needed to be heard (or, more accurately, EXPERIENCED) on a full-length basis to be appreciated. While most of these songs were (out of necessity) released as singles it goes without saying that the full-length LP versions of such immortal Hayes classics as "Walk On By", "I Stand Accused", "The Look Of Love", "Joy" and "Never Can Say Goodbye" were what sold their respective parent albums. If you really want a compilation of Isaac's hits then I recommend getting the now-deleted "Best of Isaac Hayes " Volumes 1 & 2 (both released in 1986) as these at least give you the original album versions without any (unnecessary) editing.
0	Good Songs with Good beats remixed with mostly bad or at least worse beats, kind of like Nu-Mixx Klassiz.  It's really nothing worth spending your money on, baby don't cry get's remixed with Black Eyed Peas' where the love is the only song I can play without puke...  It's bad quality on the remixes, I guess that's why they didn't get the Outlawz to rap some new raps on it, how they got Jadakiss and Busta is beyond imagination.  Crap....
0	Sorry, the lyrics it begins with just aren't for me. I did however momentarily at first enjoy the opening music.
0	I am tired of hearing the same rap over and over again, so I decided to explore the latest R&B offerings.  Yes, R&B is not what it used to be because great singers have been replaced by model wannabes.  Musicians have been replaced by the single hip-hop 'producer' DJ.  It makes for simplistic, boring and repetitive 'music.'  Sadly, Bobby V fell victim to having to do the same old stuff with the same old beats and the same old style of 'singing' as we have heard over the past ten years - although material in roughly the first half of the last decade (2000's for those who do not realize that we are in a new decade)was pretty good for the hip-hop DJ 'producer.  With that said, Bobby V talks about the same thing throughout the album.  How much "I want you," "I need you," "I got to have you," "I can live without you" and "I want you body" songs can people sing?  Songs are incomplete and I feel more like I am listening to a hip-hop mix-tape instead of what should have been a smooth R&B album.  Bobby V spends too much time thinking that he is sexy and not enough time making good music.  I tried my best to like it as I want something to like.  I had to listen to The Temptations just to ease my mind and hear REAL signing with REAL music.  I say avoid until R&B singers ditch the hip-hop DJ 'producer' and get that live band of musicians to make the music as singers should have.
0	Was a bit disappointed.
0	This is an excellent performance of a very obscure (but not unimportant) opera. However, this is a 1 disc highlight issue, which is not called out in the description. very disappointing.
0	I suppose, in hindsight, you really can't blame Simon Cowell. I mean, what do you do when the winner of your talent show (that would be Britain's Got Talent) ISN'T a singer - but a dancer? This is Simon Cowell we're talking about here, remember; a monster hit TV show is nothing without a token record to stink up the charts after-wards.  And whilst Cowell re-released the song that George Sampson danced to (Mint Royale's previously ignored dance mix of Singing in the Rain - now a number one hit because it appeared on this show. A sure-fire sign that Cowell basically tells his ignorant viewers WHAT to buy and they'll buy it), he was left with the head-scratching problem of how else he could milk this little Sampson creep before his 15 minutes were up.  And lo - this terrible single was born. Because not only does George dance in the video, in a way that a million other kids in music videos do, oh no - he RAPS now, too. And if you hear a more grating, hateful thing this year, you have full permission to murder whoever is responsible. It'll be doing a public service.  So yes, it's an obvious attempt to cash in on High School Musical, but with one fatal flaw, not taking into consideration the fact George can't sing or rap to save his life. No, the REAL problem here? George Sampson is an obnoxious snot, with a face you would never tire of pouring boiling water over. That he can't rap is obvious, but is it really possible for one human being to be this loathsome?  As for the music itself, there's 2 tracks of equal "worth" here (it's a double A-side, a laughably optimistic notion that he would actually get a full ALBUM on the back of this), and both should be banned from ever being played in a public place. "Headz Up" (ooh, spelling things with a "Z" makes you edgy.. about 18 years ago) is a dire piece of "hip-hop" so white, so lacking in any energy or passion and so obviously created by boardroom executives you can almost smell the cappuccino. And "Get Up On the Dancefloor" is littered with samples from about ten other rap and dance tracks that are about a zillion times too good to be tacked in alongside this garbage.  It's a desperate move by Cowell to fleece some more money from his easily led British public, and the join is all too visible here. Sampson, quite clearly, can do nothing but dance, and hiding his embarrassingly weedy vocals behind all the samples and female singers in the world won't hide that fact.  Want the good news, though? This single absolutely TANKED, meaning that either the British public aren't THAT easily fooled or that Sampson's star is already beginning to fade. Either way, that news is certainly something to sing - and dance - about.
0	Charisse Pempengco is a unique very talented singer. Her voice could affect your emotion. She could make the audience cry while singing a sad song. Her debut album was very disappointing though because half of the materials in the album was made for Kareoke fans. The album was produced by cheap and greedy producers who probably decided not to spend more money for more songs so they used sing-a-long instrumental as filler. This album is not recommended for international release. Just load the songs from amazon.com and leave the instrumental part.
0	Only 1 good song smh 
0	My boyfriend ordered this for me and while the album is fantastic the quality is poor. My album came in very warped, I can't even listen to the B side. I'm a little upset because I really enjoy this band and the color of the vinyl but I can't even listen to it.
0	I don't like how the end of this song I purchased from this cd was copied on to this cd.  Instead of fading the song out like it should have been.  Where it ends on this cd the song just cuts out right in the middle of where it should go into the last 30 seconds of the instrumental part.
0	Amy Winehouse is so freakin' ugly, how does she sell albums? A total druggie, alcoholic, and god how much does she weigh, 45 pounds? She is a terrible role model, she is just as bad as Lindsay Lohan. Winehouse can't sing, she thinks she is some rockin' soul singer from the 1960's but she isn't, she is just a wannabe. Take my advice and stay away from this over-rated album, but if you like to hear a troubled and pathetic woman whining about going to rehab which is where she is now, then this album should make you happy.
0	Sorry stevie fans. I cannot agree with your breathless bowing at the feet of stevie. I was hoping it would be good. ..but it's weak. enough of the tortured breakup songs, some of the lyrics are really awkward. hardly any memorable melodies. the title track is good...the rest should have been left in the vault.
0	It didn't have all tge songs on it. So its ok , I guess.
0	This is not the song she sang for T. Carter Music. I was ripped off.
0	Don't get me wrong, I like Meghan Trainor, but 10 out of 50 songs?  She's not 20% of the POP market.  Someone has drank too much of her Kool-Aid...
0	This is horrible. I wish I could delete this from my memory. I don't know why I ever bought this
0	This song contains the word B***h. I bought it because I thought the U.S. Edit was more radio friendly for the time in which this song came out.  I was so wrong.
0	Not my favorite.
0	I really love this song which is why I bought it but I don't like this remix version. I prefer the radio version. When I listened to the 30 second sample, it didn't have the remix so I didn't know it wasn't the plain version. Kinda disappointed.
0	If you want to listen to music from a band whose drummer is literally part of the reason this world is so messed up then this is the band for you!
0	There are 3 scratches on side a and 1 more on side b.  Other than the skipping, the rest plays fine.
0	I'm really bummed--I liked the song and bought it.  I thought I'd reviewed it carefully enough on You Tube, but as I was listening to it with my pre-teen I heared the f-word!  I wish I'd noticed it before.  Not sure why there isn't an "explicit" label!
0	The "mastermind" behind Pink Floyd has taken a style he created over 40 years ago and just beat it to death. There is nothing original in concept or style that he hasn't been doing since DSOTM. He just hates Trump now instead of Margaret Thatcher.
0	Love the song, love the Toadies, but F*** being "encouraged" to install an application I don't want and did not invite.  I did NOT select that I wanted the "download" application.  How about Amazon's executive installing my application on their systems, huh?  Do you know how many bogus sites there are, just begging you to install their "downloader"?  God help you if you do, because they've got you by the balls, then.  I do not trust Microsoft, and I do not trust this application will not try to enforce digital rights management that I did not agree to.  SHAME ON AMAZON !!!
0	is that the fave band of Justin Timberlake? the band has already to take a pause for one year until 2005! because not only the lead singer gets married but   he worries that the fans will be getting bored with them all.   PS: that's why the dino hard rocking bands like Zeppelin, deep purple, uriah heep, sabbath who are still able to continue their golden ages   since the last 33 years, and the fans are still loving them until today. But the new youngster like Coldplay?? they just started their career for   3 years ago?? and they want to stop now?? it is a wonderful shame!!
0	I was very excited for this album to come out. I have been a fan of Rivers and the =w= since childhood. I'm only on my first day of listening, but am in shock at the quality. Big hype over this album and all it is is random, jammy songs put into an album. Plus I've heard half of these songs in the past with the same quality or better. Not too impressed. But I will always purchase Weezer related albums for support, but after the green album, make believe, and now this... I'm a bit turned off. "Lover in the Snow", "Blast Off", & "Who You Callin' Bitch" are the only worthy songs... again, I've heard these before this album. Go buy the Blue Deluxe album. It's a way better buy!
0	Paid for the twice and each time I didn't get the whole cd.
0	I gave this album a few listens and liked it even less on my second go around. Through the years the sound has become very stale and all around un-inspired, at least to me. The first song I ever heard from Rasputina was Transylvanian Concubine and I loved it!! In 2000 I picked up How We Quit The Forest it being my first album of theirs I was in love with it. The music on their first 2 albums was so lush and passionate, I even enjoyed her vocals much more on those first 2 albums.    This is going to be a little review on their progression in my opinion just because I really feel the need to.    Thanks for the Ether - 4.5/5 Nearly perfect    How We Quit The Forest - 5/5 Pefect ( my fav)    Cabin Fever - 4/5 this album for me is like a transition between phase 1 and phase 2 of Rasputina some songs remind me of songs off of the first albums and some of songs off later albums over all very strong.    Lost and Found - 3/5 Not horrible but over all forgettable best song is the Pink Floyd cover oh and the traditional cover.    Frustration Plantation - 3 This is where they started to fall in my mind, they got rid of most of their creative drum arrangements and the music came somewhat flat and boring it had some songs that I really enjoyed but over all it was a let down.    Oh Perilous World - 3.5/5 this album feels like a sequel in a true sense to FP, slightly improved and building off the style of that album. There are some very nice songs on here, and again some very boring songs.    Sister Kinderhook - 2/5 now Finally here we arrive with yet another album of the same mishmash and this time with few standout tracks ( the 2 miss leavens,Humankind as the Sailor, Dark February(after this song it crashed and burned for me)) and a complete lack of creativity boring and pretty much the polar opposite of Thanks For the Ether. They have completely lost that magic and are now in a cloud of formula and monotony, I know this review is probably dragging on on and I am repeating myself, but I always eagerly anticipated New Rasputina releases and I hoped FP was just a misstep but they went down hill from there for the most part. Maybe it was because the more band essence rather than Just Melora I don't know but I feel like Rasputina is a close friend who has cancer and they are slowly dieing, hopefully the radiation treatments come by and eradicate the cancer. This album is really a shame because the 3 tracks that stood out to me were amazing but 3 songs on a 14 track album is just sub-par. I want to hear something fresh something that makes me want to come back again and again.    Side Note:   Great American Gingerbread - 3.5/5 there are some beautiful tracks on here that take me back some years worth getting for 1-3,6-10 and 13    Sorry for the lengthy review...haha
0	Never recorded item.
0	Many tracks on the MP3 version are glitched, like it's a bad CD rip. Buy the CD instead, this is unlistenable.
0	My grandson helped me with the first one (via Mp3?#), but I couldn't figure out how to get it downloaded to use it on my DVD maker for hours!!! And I never did - cloud player? what? I kept going in circles until I gave up... never finished that project, and the party's over!

0	Run Like Hell....I really do not need to say much else. That is a cool album cover art picture though. Remember when Chucky Cheese was fun? Now it is all video games. Not cool. Oh yeah, this music blows mules.
0	Anyone who is as big of a Maiden fan as I am would naturally be excited upon hearing that Steve Harris is releasing a solo album.  However, before listening to a single note and researching how it all came to be, it becomes immediately clear that Steve Harris has a very different definition of 'solo album' than, well, anybody else.  Steve has spoken of the already established band "British Lion" as early as 1992.  Look for the interview on the Maidenfans site.  It's a band he discovered and was looking to help.  Now, 20 years later, the band's debut album has finally seen the light of day.  Yes, Steve Harris has joined the band, and supposedly co-wrote all the songs (but as in Maiden, this could simply mean he helped with arrangements and/or perhaps added a little section to a pre-existing song, etc).  I have no doubt the plan is to use Steve's name to get the album exposure.  But make no mistake; this is by no means a true solo album.  All that aside, if it's good, it's good.  Unfortunately, it really isn't.  Much has been made about the poor vocals on this album.  Really, they are indeed pretty thin, lack power, and have a certain amateurish quality.  Additionally, the production of the album is pretty weak.  The guitars and drums are underneath the bass (even much more so than on recent Maiden albums), and the album has a demo sounding quality to it.  But most importantly, I find the songs rather dull.  I can honestly say I find none of it very catchy, and it's mostly generic rock that never gets too adventurous.  I am just glad we live in an age where music can be streamed legally before deciding to purchase it.  Wanting to give the CD a fair chance, I have listened to it about 5 times, and I do believe I have reached my limit.  I just hope Steve doesn't waste too much time on this project, at least not to the point where Maiden is put on the back burner.  I'm sure it's fun for Steve to do something away from Maiden, though, and I do respect him doing something different, even if it's something I can't get into on any level.  And heck, if worse comes to worse and Maiden does go on hiatus, maybe it would mean that it allows time for Bruce Dickinson to make another solo record.  If that becomes the case, then I guess I would have some reason to be thankful for British Lion.
0	I have seen LA on TV and liked what i heard so i bought this cd and was not that pleased felt the production was lacking i did borrow there first cd from my library and was really pleased with what i heard so this one is not a winner in my book .
0	My grandchildren are 7, 5,5 and 3  were not interested in this CD at all.  It was too complicated and with the various voices did not seem to have any repetition.  They just were not interested in the arrangements.  We went back to Disney's Songs for Children and they were singing along again.  I cannot recommend this CD for this age child.
0	If your kid is listening to this drivel (like mine is), then you can rest assured there's worse out there. This is harmless, imitation rebellion of little consequence. If they like it, fine. Still, you wonder what a bunch of Canadian kids could possibilly have to say about California punk. (About as much as Vanilla Ice had to say about rap, I imagine). The band needs to get their own life, instead of trying to borrow someone else's and sell it. There's nothing wrong with asking yourself "Where did I go wrong?" when you hear it coming from you offspring's headphones. But hang in there. In a couple of months, he and every other kid with this one will be tryng to sell it back at the used CD section (to raise enough dough for the inevitable "Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hits" disc.)
0	Absolutely hideous. I use it as a deterrent to bad behavior among students. It can get in your head and drive you nuts. "Please! Not the Mmmbop! That's too cruel !" I use it very sparingly.
0	Not good condition
0	Got this as a gift. I would say this is slightly more than elevator music. Most of the tracks are sort of watered down versions of previous music like Shine on You Crazy Diamond etc. It is not offensive and you could play this as background music at a party but I would never sit down and listen to this just to listen to it.
0	Big fan of Amel L and I've purchased all of her previous recordings. This is my least favorite of all.  The lyrics, arrangements are mediocre at best.  Even the sound quality is lacking.  Very disappointed.
0	I don't have a problem with Mott the Hoople nor the songs not their performances but the audio quality is atrocious as the volume is too low and the sound is too thin. Its like going out with a ravishing beauty and finding out she's the worst lover ever. On a good sound system the audio on this 2 CD set is abysmal. Really nothing left to add.
0	Terrible Disc!  Her voice is like nails down a chalk board.  I was 100% disappointed.
0	Guess I learned my lesson on buying cd's from now on. Don't buy this product if you plan on installing it to your itunes library and then installing it via your ipod.......will not let you! Oh but itunes sure does direct you to the itunes digital version OF COURSE! Complete waste of money.
0	It wasn't really what i thought.
0	When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z. They have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted Deja Vu, and the recent Drunk In Love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart, and Bonnie & Clyde '03. It isn't a good song, because it has been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband. Still, there needs to be better in voice and being crazy in love.  Song: D+
0	I thought these would be less choral and symphonic and more popular. If you like these dirges then this is for you.
0	Nicole Atkins' 2014 release pales beside earlier albums like Neptune City and Mondo Amore.  My wife's comment was "bubblegum", which you certainly couldn't say about earlier efforts.  There was a sameness about the songs as well.  This one goes on the block and I'll look forward to Atkins' next effort.
0	So overrated, Kinison did this and BETTER with wittiness.  Black does nothing accept say normal sentences ("It's so cold in MN, no one should live here.") in an enraged voice, as if he's the only person who ever made a joke about it being cold.  This is comedy?  There are no bits, punchlines, there is nothing.  Take away the fake angriness, and there is even less.  I want my money back.
0	I, too, was disappointed in this version of the song.  I liked the original version where it was just Iz with his beautiful voice and his ukelele.  If Amazon could get this original version of this song, I would definitely purchase that one.  This is my first MP3 purchase with Amazon and I purchased it with a promotional credit I received from them.  They were extremely helpful with the process of helping me find and download the song from them to my computer.  Thanks, Amazon.
0	Bought this as a gift, and in my personal opinion, this wasn't a good album. The person I bought this for loved it though, so the purchase wasn't a total waste
0	Not playing  the quality is not what I expected  only 5 seconds of playtime for a 3 minute song. Money back pls
0	I don't need it.
0	I do not own and did not purchase this product.
0	Got as a gift bad rating is to stop recommendations
0	I accidentally bought it. I hate it. I think you have to have a military background to enjoy it. It's certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor.
0	I thought the artists who slowed down the tempo were dragging out the songs as if to say, "Look at me, I'm doing a Smiths song." Showboating.
0	This song is so annoying. At first I liked it but it was so over-played and just has become annoying and over-rated, just like the artist who sings it.
0	Just rec'd my copy from Amazon--and so disappointed.  Just expected it to be like my other Andrew Bird CD's.  Wish I could trade it.  Am sure others may like.  After all, we are all different.
0	Another piece of hyped, commercialized trash. Absolutley sickening piece of garbage, anyone that bought this album has a mental problem.
0	Bad idea to give this album the title of 'Junk'. That's pretty much what it is.
0	Boring. Uninspiring. Cheap. A huge let down.
0	This is the worst piece of vinyl I've ever purchased, making it really hard to know how to rate this since I love the album. I ended on a 1-star so hopefully anyone reading this will stick to digital/cd.  Vinyl is extremely thin, and so light I have to use a weight to keep it from slipping on a felt mat. The vinyl was slightly warped, and the hole for the spindle on both records had so much flashing that I had to use a knife to cut out the excess vinyl just so it could fit on the spindle. This is literally the worst quality record I own, and that's including old garage sale vinyl that was siting in the sun priced at 5 bucks for a crate.
0	The first song on the album 'Sleeping Ute' is a monster, but every song thereafter is questionable.  I expected more from this album.
0	I love Local Natives, however, the recording quality of this album is terrible.
0	Who am I to judge....listened to it but it just wasn't my type of music....maybe someone else would like this type of music
0	No lyrics, just music.  Was dissappointed.
0	i cannot rate the cd as it will not play.  i ordered two cds.  one of johnny mathis plays well but the susan boyle just makes my cd player stop.  i tried it in each of 5 slots.  i am 66 and the only person in my home and therefore, i know that it has been handled with care.  i didn't return it sooner as i have had other things to do - job searching, filling out forms regarding bp oil spill, taxes on my dad's estate, etc.  i would like to exchange the cd for another of the same - if that is possible.  thank you, rochelle
0	Sounds like a dying cat. I wouldn't. Waste 10 cents let alone a dollar. Another no talent using auto tune.
0	I use a lot of soundtrack but this one is very poor quality and I do not recommend, it is terrible, not clear and I do not recommend. Waste of money.
0	The sample of the song sounded beautiful.  The middle of this song changes styles and in my opinion is awful.
0	Total garbage.  I've never heard such trash.
0	This recording's volume is too low.
0	Really good
0	Wow. I knew without Roger Waters it might not be as good, but come on. If I had wanted a lame, new age, relaxation tape from the 90's I would have looked beneath my Grateful Dead bootleg collection. I am actually angry. I want to unfriend the guy who recommended this piece to me. I have to go listen to Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking and Amused to Death just to wash the suck out of my soul.
0	Just listened to it, that was depressing. DELETED
0	All the hype about this album from Jim saying this is going to be a straight up classic metal album is right, however it's not what I was hoping for. One thing Breuer said was something along the lines of he wanted it to feel like a real rock CD, not just a novelty, but after listening a couple of times, I can't help but think it's all it really turned out to be.  It's a mixture of hard rock sounds, mostly 80's, where things either sound like Metallica or another 80's band influenced, as well as a little bit of AC/DC. Sure when I heard Brian Johnson was going to guest vocal on a track, I was stoked and couldn't wait to hear it, after all we should all be familiar by now with Hokey Pokey by now, and maybe even when Jim and Brian preformed it together one night. I was almost devastated as I heard acoustic guitars and what seemed like a ballad about to start up with Brian Johnson talking over it, and then the track ended. I almost cried thinking "Don't tell me thats it?" but luckily the next track "Mr Rock N Roll" kicked in and Brian does great singing it with J.B. However, even tho I can say it's the strongest track on this entire album... in fact, it's the only memorable one if you ask me, I have already made my own edited down version that cuts out a weak bridge that I thought slowed down the song, and would work well had it been a late 80's Alice Cooper track, but on here with Brian, it seemed enough out of place that I edited it right out of the song, so I can't give it the perfect score.  As for the rest of the album... I suppose if you can't get enough of that 80's metal sound, then you may love this... but I was not hearing great riffs, and it was clouded in a theme that this was being sung by a guy who escapes his family life and records his music in a garage... which is what this album was going for, but in the end, it felt like a common theme where each song was "My family stresses me out and I escape to the garage to rock out" which is ok, but it's not the greatest theme an album could go for, and I found myself rolling my eyes at some songs.  Overall, I'm sorry to say, it does come off sounding like a novelty album. I'd compare it to John Valby's CD "Valby Rocks" where its filled with a bunch of generic sounding rock songs that don't bore you, but don't grab you either. Apart from Mr Rock N Roll, I doubht i'd wanna hear anything off this album anytime soon, or care to see JB preform anything else from this album live. It really did come off as a novelty nostalgia album to 80's metal music. Which is not something i'm against, don't get me wrong... but it could have been much much better. Perhaps if Jim asked more of his rock star friends to help out with guest vocals, it might have made a bigger impact than what it ended up being.
0	Sucks not the radio version
0	that's all.
0	I graduated hs in 1978, the year the debut album was released. Rock was floundering at the time, great artists like Sabbath and Priest were not getting much air play, disco sure was. All of the sudden, VH hits the scene and revives rock. I mean wow, they took the world by storm. To be honest, I was never much of a VanHagar fan, no disrespect to Sammy. I loved him with Montrose and was a fan of some of his solo stuff. Now, onto this train wreck. All due respect to DLR, if you have to talk most of the lyrics, maybe it's time to hang up the vocal cords. The band sounds pretty right on but when Dave opens his mouth, oy vey! Maybe they should go Journey and find a guy with Dave's chops who can sing. I think I'll go spin Diver Down now...
0	I don't like this near as well as Sinatra's Duets and Duets II.  It probably represents its time period pretty well, but the style of Frank and his music back then was not nearly as good, in my opinion, as the latter day Frank Sinatra and those orchestrations.
0	I have been a Maroon 5 fan since the beginning of their career and always look forward to what they will do next UNTIL NOW!!  What happened to Maroon 5? Make sure to listen to the CD before purchasing, I wish I had. There are a few great songs on here, but for the most part there are songs I will not listen to again.
0	VULGAR
0	Nice song but the live version it does not sound so good
0	I love this song.  I risked downloading it because the sample sounded just fine, but yeah, it's really, really distorted.  I have great speakers, I don't think they're the cause.
0	can't determine if music downloaded, can't find where it downloaded or to what file....won't download from amazon music again, due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	Save your money, this is weak, slow and plodding.  Sounds like they are on some kind of barbiturates.
0	lyrics, music and vocals are JV at best. better to go with something like Kip Moore or Eric Church or Tim McGraw
0	The Beach Boys tracks here are ones that the group recorded BEFORE they signed with Capitol Records in 1962. NONE of them were hits; in fact, half of them weren't originally released at all. The ones that were released are "Surfin'," "Luau," "Barbie," and "What Is A Young Girl Made Of." The former two tracks were released as the group's first single; the latter two were released under the name of "Kenny And The Cadets."  "Surfin'" was included on the group's first album, but was sped up for some reason. The group later re-recorded "Surfin' Safari" and "Surfer Girl," and those remakes were the versions that were hits for the group. Most of the Jan & Dean tracks are NOT the hit recordings; they are re-recordings that were made in the late '70s without Jan. They can't compare to the hit versions. In fact, although J&D had recorded "Little Deuce Coupe" in the '60s, it wasn't a hit even then. "Heart And Soul" is the only hit J&D recording here --- not only that, but it's also the only hit recording on this whole CD. Not really a terrible CD, I guess, but don't get it looking to find the hits.
0	i never ordered this an its on my iTunes. it sucks..
0	Not the ORIGINAL recording.  RIPOFF
0	I pretty much think it's garbage and not country at all.
0	I really liked song "through the glass" from the radio, however after listening to the whole album, the rest of the songs to me were mediocre to bad. I would suggest just getting the single and saving some bucks. At least find someone who already has it and give it a listen first, this is just my opinion of the album.
0	Weak cadance, low volume, check out the USMC you will be much happier you did
0	I gave this 2 stars not based on the music, but that if my 12 year old gets into trouble his new punishment will be having to listen to this over and over again until he begs for mercy.
0	The download I got after paying is a corrupt file. My mp3 player gives an error message half way in playing. I sent email to Amazon customer service. They replied that they allow download only once. So they cannot help me!  If you decide to buy, you better pray that nothing bad happens during the download, because you got only one chance. I don't remember exactly how big the file is. Must be more than 100MB. Here's Amazon reply in all its official glory:  "I'm sorry to hear that you encountered a problem with "Relaxing Seaside (Nature Sounds Only Version)" by Nature Sound Series.  Amazon MP3 files are only available for download at the time of purchase. We display information about the items you've purchased from the Amazon MP3 Music Downloads store in Your Media Library so you can keep track of what you've bought and discover similar items that may be available.

0	I didn't appreciate the blatant racism through out the album.
0	I didn't order this either
0	I love this song, but it doesn't play on my phone. Horrible service!
0	This is a CD-R Sound quality is very poor and the brochure of four pages has two blank pages and no info about the opera or singers. Only lists the track numbers and a track title.
0	My biggest complaint is that there are non-Christmas tracks on this CD. A Christmas CD should be Christmas related songs. Over half of  the songs here are just regular reggae tracks. More important is this is a duplicate listing. The cover of this CD is a curly haired blonde girl holding her hands out with "Irie Christmas" across the top. There is another listing of this CD with a photo of this cover for a whole lot less money. I wouldn't buy that one either.
0	The music and the voice bring back memories---of how good he used to be.  He has lost that edge that made him so extraordinary and popular.  But we all get old, alas, and it's time for him to retire.
0	I had pre-ordered this CD because I had the item on vinyl and it is really good.  However, when I found out that Hallmark label did the reissue, I cancelled the order.  Hallmark label is a cheap foreign company operating out of London. I bought a  Mary Wells and a Marvelettes CD by this outfit last year, and was really disappointed in the sound quality. It is worse than if I had made a copy directly from my LPs.  There is a lot of excessive noise and volume fluctuations.  Some reputable company should re-issue this itemm, but I am staying away from any Hallmark label products in the future.
0	Great lyrics, but the music pacing on this album version is too manic for a bittersweet/retrospective song of lost love.  I have heard two live versions and the pace was slowed significantly making a much better song.
0	Warning! This is NOT the original recording and nowhere is that simple fact mentioned. It makes me want to request my money back.
0	Well.. Where to start.. After Getting The originall and The City of prauge version this was a total let down.. I mean the originall Score Drink up me Hearties was Very Good but City of Prauge took it to another level then i heard this version and i was like completely let down.. It has a few ups and downs the instruments used were terrible.. Theres really nothing i enjoy about it at all.. I give it 1 extra star for the effort but if ur gonna re-do scores please do it right! if ur looking for a real orchestra re-mix of the pirates trilogy check out City of Prauge..
0	I thought DeRosa would stop with the whining about topics he knows nothing about, much less should reference in his so-called "comedy". He's been on some forgettable internet videos as well as some bland radio appearances, but I still thought he deserved a second chance. What a mistake.  It's like he was given the choice between being funny and needlessly worrying about the possible thoughts of his racially diverse group of friends and he chose the latter. I could only describe this abomination of a CD as grotty.
0	The song was good but his age took it's toll on the quality of the original. His original had that full range and power of his youthful voice..
0	I bought this song for the nostalgia and to give the kids a peek into the songs of the 70's. But seriously, I feel like I was taken by paying 99 cents for this song. It wasn't as funny as I remember it.
0	I did not order this!  My 3 yr old did!  No way to cancel an accidental digital order.  Ugh!  $12 wasted!  I tried to listen to it, but it is not my cup of tea at all.  Very screetchy.  If you're a newer Bjork fan, you'll probably like it, but I am not a fan.  Update: I tried listening to this album again...it still sucks.  It is now officially my digital beer coaster.
0	There are sometimes songs that are worth being remixed and sampled that they are better later on. But in the case with covering a song today, it can be as bigger or smaller than when the song had originally came out. Fall Out Boy has had a nice return to the industry a few years ago with Centuries and Uma Thurman. But when I had heard that they were going to do a remake of a classic movie song, I was honestly not impressed with what I had heard. In fact, it sounded much cheaper than when Ray Parker Jr. was accused of stealing from Huey Lewis & The News's hit I Want A New Drug back in the 80's. Fall Out Boy's version of the Ghostbusters (I'm Not Afraid) is honestly one of the cheapest remakes that sounds much worse than what I had first heard years ago. It is not only a poor remake, but definitely is one of those songs that you can easily say, "Boy, did I waste my time on this song!" The guys from Fall Out Boy did better covers before, like their rendition of Michael Jackson's Beat It several years ago. You're better off downloading the original, or the original sample from 1984. This version is definitely not worth the money!!  Song: F

0	these are NOT the original songs that we all know and love.  well, they ARE, but they are re-recorded with very poor music and sound like you opened up a large barrel and put a band down in there to play.  this should have never got released.

0	I dearly love Lisa Loeb's music, & I would love to buy these exclusive tracks (& her other Amazon exclusives). I own almost all of Lisa Loeb's cd's including imports, singles & several compilations she appears on. However, I refuse to pay for the AWFUL, LOSSY MP3 format.  Lisa, I would love to purchase this & your other Amazon exclusives, but only if they are either lossless downloads (flac, ape or shn) or on a physical cd. The MP3 format is the 2000's equivalent of an 8 track tape, & I refuse to pay for low quality.  10/16/09 edit: For other Lisa fans who prefer lossless, I have discovered that at least 4 of these 6 tracks are available on cd:  Look Me In The Eye - Japan Cake & Pie CD Sandlewood - Japan Tails CD AND USA Taffy CD Single Birds - Do You Sleep UK CD Single Eno Ambient #5 - Firecracker Japan CD (which also has a 2nd rare track, Guessing Game)  If anyone knows of a true cd source for Life Is Just A Bowl Of Cherries or the version of Dance With The Angels on this, please post in comments!
0	got for a friend to hear kids sound creepy
0	By the cover and title, names of songs, I think she's regretting her past. By the terrible over-auto-tuning and LSD-induced beats, I'm thinking she also plans on regretting her future.  This is such a waste.  What was she thinking??
0	I don't want to sound like sour apples but I'll be honest. I received this CD yesterday and listened to it before bedtime. I have 3 audiocassettes of METAMUSIC - MODEM, OUTREACH (both from 1985) & SLEEPING THROUGH THE RAIN (1990) - so I'm not new to the neighborhood. I enjoy them because I like synth "music" and the Hemi-Sync binaural beats are not a factor since I've never experienced anything out of the ordinary. The Monroe Institue explains the benefits of Hemi-Sync but as author Ronald Russell says in his book "The Journey of Robert Monroe", on page 359: "Passively listening to Hemi-Sync binaural beats may not automatically engender a focused state of consciousness."  So there you have it. To me, this CD is a poor product musically speaking and is not as enjoyable as the 3 titles mentioned above. In other words, this type of music with the Hemi-Sync tones embedded may be useful if you have a purpose for using them.  The worst part about this CD is that it starts with a thunderclap that makes you jump out of your underweat! It's not even a good, enjoyable thunderclap. Then the rain follows overloud with more so-so thunderclaps and loud crickets and, eventually, the "music" starts softly and the rain is replaced. It is nice synth "music" but not too long after it drifts off and is replaced by what sounds like a nylon string guitar. Not bad but it's out of place and unnecessary. It drifts off and the synth returns with more nature sounds. It all ends a lousy 28 minutes later! On a CD that can offer 80 minutes! The Monroe Institute offers a ton of similar CDs. I may not buy any of them.  I won't get into Robert Monroe, his OOBEs, his Institute, I'll save it for other reviews.
0	It's like going to a pizza place you really like - maybe not your favorite, but you're always willing to go there and from time to time you definitely get a craving - and discovering when you walk in that they're now plumbers. They might be perfectly fine plumbers, but that's not why you showed up.  I kept thinking about Brandi Carlile's song "Mainstream Kid" while listening to this album. They're not sell-outs because they had a solid fanbase. They just decided to give up the sound that made them famous in exchange for something so bland and generic you'd have to be really listening to tell it apart from Coldplay or any number of soundalikes out there. The band has sacrificed the thing that made them unique to fit in with everything else on the radio. I would have bought this album on release date just because there was no one else out there making the kind of music I wanted to hear. If I wanted a Mumford & Sons sound, I had to buy a Mumford & Sons album. As it is, I probably have ten albums on my playlist already that have the exact same sound and similar lyrics. It's not even really worth downloading free on Prime.  I read an interview where the band said they hated the way they looked and sounded on the first two albums, and they even hated the name Mumford & Sons. Having listened to the album and given it a solid chance, I really wish they had just changed their name for this release. I don't know what band should have released this album, but it definitely was not Mumford & Sons.  I went back and forth about whether this was one-star or two. I finally decided on two because I didn't HATE the album, but I definitely don't like it.
0	Once upon a time, there was a man who lived in the faraway land of Hawthorne, California. This man possessed the gift of music, and anything he heard, he could absorb with his powerful ears and become inspired to create grand movements of melody, harmony, and rhythm.  The man's name...is Brian Wilson.  This is his talentless leech of a cousin.  Despite the fact that Mike Love couldn't play any instruments or even develop his voice beyond a nasal sneer, Brian was loyal to his cousin, and invited him to record as a band, The Beach Boys. They went on to write many hit songs about surfing and cars, often with Mr. Love's lyrics sounding like your average laundry list. This was a very successful formula, and Mike would often remind Brian not to, as he put it, "f*** with the formula." Nevertheless, Brian started to collaborate with several different lyricists, culminating in artistic success and more accusations of "f***ing with the formula" that became outright sabotage. The rest is history. You've heard what Brian can do without Mike, but this is what "Dr. Love" did without "Cousin Brian."  It's also a steaming pile of donkey crap. I would recommend this to people who believe that The Beach Boys' recording career ended with "California Girls," people who stick around for a "Beach Boys" concert even after they've realized there are no Wilsons (because they probably don't know who the Wilsons are), and people who don't know what "Rockin' the Man in the Boat" actually means, and would like to hear a song about it sung by a guy who donated money to Tipper Gore's PMRC. The rest of you who have half a brain should buy anything by Brian and Dennis Wilson.
0	I don't hate it, I just don't own this, so don't know why I was asked to review this one!
0	shipping was fine, but the disc is not very good.  Very short program on the disc.  Overall, we were greatly disappointed in this CD
0	I don't have many two star albums in my collection. Tourist by St. Germain goes down in history, to me, as one of the single greatest albums of all time. It borders on a masterpiece and, for its style and genre, can rarely be paralleled.  After all this time, I didn't really go into this album with the highest of expectations, but I also didn't expect to be completely and utterly disappointed.  Compared to Tourist, this is barely a beginner album. Compared to BOULEVARD this is a lame attempt. The guy basically should have just quit while he is ahead. That isn't to say I wouldn't like a quality follow up to Tourist, but if this is what he is doing now I think he should either stop all together, or at least use a different moniker so that he can set a different standard for a less involved sound.  If you're a St. Germain fan, don't buy this album. It's a waste of your time and, what's worse, it was a waste of his time to produce.  Viva la Tourist!
0	AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE PURCHASED THESE TWICE...IS THIS NECESSARY WHEN I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY THESE SONGS.....I TRIED TO DOWNLOAD....THEY WENT SOMEWHERE BUT NOT ON MY IPOD.
0	This is about the farthest thing from country music I can think of. WHoa smack!
0	If you are forgoing the vinyl for MP3s, at least buy this one at iTunes. This is a general rule when purchasing any MP3 from Amazon. Although Amazon states that "Songs are encoded at 256 kbps" [http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/help/faq.html/ref=sv_dmusic_0] they actually use a variable bit rate which means sometimes it's 256 kbps, sometimes it can be, say, 195 kbps. If you care at all about audio quality, and prefer MP3s, at least purchase this from iTunes where the songs are all at a constant rate of 256 kbps. I was initially attracted to Amazon over itunes because of the lower pricing, but it appears it comes at a compromise of quality. In the case of this recording, Breeders "Fate to Fatal," all 4 songs are under 256 kbps and as low as 195 kbps.
0	can't determine if music downloaded, can't find where it downloaded or to what file....won't download from amazon music again, due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	While Beyonce' has had a lot of hits, there are a lot of songs that she has had on her own, and with Destiny's Child that have been less than a entity for your music collection. Diva is definitely one of those lackluster songs. The third single from her 3rd album I Am Sasha Fierce, really fails to ignite a heart and soul appeal to her singnature style. The song is trying to show that she can rap and be the best of both worlds, like Mary J. Blige or Lil' Kim. While it feels she is trying to bring that side out which she borrowed from her husband, Jay-Z, she misses the beat by a longshot. This song is even lower than Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It), and much worse than If I Were A Boy. I hope that the next single from I Am Sasha Fierce feels more like a tiger, than feels timid like a sad pussycat.  Song: D-
0	This music is just absolutely terrible. And by buying and it you are supporting an ass. I have nothing else to say.
0	I am extremely dissatisfied with this purchase, it does not play for some reason.
0	Jonah Hex is bad. Really bad. Please turn around now and pick up another movie.  Don't trust the low Amazon rating? Read on. I have an almost masochistic fascination with really bad films so I watched this knowing it got terrible reviews from movie-goers and reviewers alike. Sometimes a movie is so bad, you just have to watch it to experience the utter ridiculosity of the filmmaker and new-found heights of cinematic stupidity, like Uwe Boll's seminal crapfest&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/House-of-the-Dead/dp/B00466FMDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">House of the Dead</a>, ranked consistently in IMDB's 100 worst films of all time. Even in its awfulness, there's a sort of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000/dp/B00006RJCL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>-like entertainment value as an example of WTF filmmaking to poke fun at. It's so bad, it makes you laugh. Jonah Hex is so bad it makes you want to punch all those involved in bringing this atrocity to the screen. Aside from the sight of the lovely Megan Fox in a bodice, there's really no reason to watch this complete mess of a film. If you enjoyed last summer's bomb&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/G-I-Joe-The-Rise-of-Cobra/dp/B002NXSRX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</a>, however, you might like Jonah Hex.  Previous reviewers hit it right on the head when they likened JH to Wild Wild West and Van Helsing for its mix of western, sci-fi and steampunk. All 3 films had big, likable stars, were ridiculously campy and failed miserably at the box office. I'll add in another:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-League-of-Extraordinary-Gentlemen/dp/B000ICLRHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a>&nbsp;for JH's similarity in plot of bad guy building a terrifying ship-based superweapon that can level cities and supernatural/occult overtones. I like hero/anti-hero action, westerns/period films and historical fiction, with an occasional bit of camp, but with a muddled script, a snooze-inducing villain, and a really crappy hero, Jonah Hex manages to get everything wrong in its brief 72 minutes. On top of that, the decision to mix heavy metal into the film was just dumb. The consistently excellent Marco Beltrami provides part of the score and progressive metal band Mastadon provides the rest. Westerns and heavy metal do not mix, especially during shootouts, adding a decided factor of cheese to the whole thing. I like westerns, I like action. I like metal. I do not like them all at once.  Never mind some of the severe gaps in storytelling logic: Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, went on to design a secret super-weapon for the US government that it never built, but it had all the parts and plans just lying around? Never mind that a band of ex-Confederate rebels with no scientific or engineering background can build the thing in a few weeks or the unexplained source of the glowing orbs that provide the explosive power. Never mind because this movie is already so bad that logic gaps can't make it worse.  Josh Brolin, who I loved in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B0011BE3K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">No Country for Old Men</a>, is totally uninteresting in his portrayal of the title character. Maybe there wasn't much he could've done with the script. He is devoid of personality and so is his arch enemy, John Malkovich, who looks more like bum than villain and maybe even more boring than he was in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Eragon/dp/B000NA28I4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Eragon</a>. The last time I saw this much wood was at a gay pride parade. Michael Fassbender does give the film a much-needed splash of personality as the vicious and combat-adept Irish psychopath Burke, as does Aiden Quinn as President Grant, and the Smith who makes Jonah's gear. In his brief 2 or 3 minutes onscreen, Smith manages to convey more warmth and personality than Brolin does in the entire film.  What killed this movie, aside from the lack of character development and plot that's as chopped up as Hex's face, was just how lame Hex was as a hero. I'm not familiar with the comics, but if Hex is supposed to be the strong, silent type, you won't see it here. Brolin's Hex can hardly fight and gets shot really easily. He's pretty much a wimp and a bungler. I didn't expect to see the archetypal "Man With No Name" that Clint Eastwood made famous (though there is a scene ripped off from Fistful of Dollars), but I did expect a solid measure of bad-assedness, self-reliance, and the ability to avoid getting shot, either by using brains, or quick reflexes. He seems to have no knowledge of combat/assault tactics and would've died if not for the unexplained Indian medicine men who keep reviving his sorry carcass. He depends on fancy weapons more than wit, quick-thinking, or fighting abilities. The gatling gun that features so prominently on the movie poster, you see only once. For about 20 seconds. He is so poor at being a hero that he gets ambushed trying to do an ambush -- he gets jumped by Burke as he tries to sneak up the plank to their boat. At night... Lastly is some questionable CG. The crayola-colored dreamworld/flashback sequences are cheesy and poorly done as are some really fake looking explosions. Even the superweapon is lame. It shoots out cannonballs, and then a glowing Dragon Ball to detonate them.  Ugh.. watch this only if you feel life is too long. I'm hoping there's a director's cut somewhere that can redeem this movie somewhat. As it stands, 1.5 stars at most.
0	well i am glad it was free..don't waste your money on this one unless you really love the guy..i just didn't like it.
0	The answer, in short, is a resounding "No!" I have enjoyed the Floyd since their early years. Some albums were good, others a bit dark. This offering of crud from this geriatric is proof that all the years of drug-taking and hedonistic self-righteous preaching have taken a toll. It appears that Waters is going through a mid-life crisis (male menopause). When some men go through it, they buy a sports car or dress and behave like teens. Mr Waters tries to remain relevant by being foul-mouthed and by jumping on the Trump-bashing bandwagon (a sure popularity win, but by no means bold, nor courageous). It should have been titled "Is This The Drivel We Really Want To Listen To?". What a waste of good music - the instrumentals are really good, but Roger has defecated all over it with his preachy politics and stuttering tourettes-inspired tirade. David Gilmour has aged well whereas Roger Waters is just an embarrassment and in need of frail care.
0	another balcony sacrifice. they should be ashamed of themselves
0	No way to tell from the blurb whether this consisted of original recordings; it did not.  The seller graciously refunded my money.
0	__Misidentified__ by someone (not by Chandos Records, whose website has it right). This is _not_ his Te Deum in B-flat, Op. 66 (which lasts an hour, not 6 minutes, and which, I think, is as yet commercially unrecorded, though there is a BBC broadcast.) It is the Te Deum Laudamus section of his Op. 10 Service . See page 6 of the link  http://chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%209548.pdf  -- the notes to this recording (by Lewis Foreman, 1997).  Rating just- to rate and submit, but I would "like" more care.  Scores of these works are available at IMSLP and information is available elsewhere. This wasn't hard for me to find out.
0	I could not get it to go on my Ipod.
0	I also downloaded this and it's just blank  - low buzzing noise.  What a scam and rip-off.  Don't do what I did and waste a dollar (can't imagine how many people they have ripped off)!!!
0	I did not like this song, even though I usually like ballads
0	They need to remove Bob Marley name from this cd.  Not the original version.
0	I've been a fan of Natalie and the 10,000 Maniacs since the 90s.  Difficult to swallow these deconstructed, depressing versions of songs that she did earlier.  They were uplifting, melodic, and magical in their original states, but here, they seem lifeless and devoid of any inspiration.
0	this album sucks. way to butcher hunger strike. and a skid row cover? hook this band up like the human centipad. rubbish.
0	The song titles reveal a cry for help - Are You Alright?, Unsuffer Me, Everything Has Changed, Rescue, etc.  I began listening to Lucinda when I first moved to Austin, TX (mid 80's)with Happy Woman Blues & Ramblin'. She has really fallen into a glorification of her pain.
0	The owner posing this record as a long playing single to sell it,tell them it's a 45 single instead of 12"maxi single...I bought one!
0	Well, having discovered Jane Monheit with her wild recording of Send in the Clowns and heard several other great songs by her since, I'm glad tor read that I am not the only one disappointed by this album.  Truthfully, I kind of enjoy the trumpeter, but Jane babbles along as if she has had a few too many to drink.  Sure, jazz can be slinky and sultry, but I can hardly understand a word this lady sings here.  The whole album seems to be a forced, smoky backroom performance that is better left to lesser singers.  She's a great singer, but not this time.
0	When it has came down to Katy Perry, she hasn't really hit the nail on the head with her music as much as the fans wanted. That lackluster appeal is written all in her album Prism. Her song Roar from that album is absolutely a cheater in song as well, which sounds too close in ear to what Sara Bareilles did with Brave earlier this year, which honestly was a much dearer song in voice and sonnet. I really didn't find the song to be a s empowering as was the case with her influence Queen. I really found the song to not only not deliver, but I found it to be another boring pop song that had lackluster drive in the words of a diva. If you are a hard core Katy Perry fan, you'll want this song, but it isn't really worth the money and the roar.  Song: D+
0	This is a  boring presentation. There are much better resources for the study of Blues Banjo. This album really is not much for simple enjoyment, once one has abandoned any thought of studying it. The singing and the picking is simply not attractive. I'm sorry I bought this. If you don't believe me, compare this to the lessons and opportunities in Fred Sokolow's Blues Banjo, Lessons, Riffs, Songs and More. Some tracks, such as Kassie Jones, show that this player has more to offer than he gives us in most of the tracks on this album. Gratefully, when he does not sing, the very repetitive picking could be worth imitating, just to stretch one's hands. This definitely is not what I hoped to hear.
0	Janeen Brady music is fantastic, I grew up singing and dancing to her music in my moms preschool. I'm buying it for my own preschool now. I'd recommend buying directly through britekids.com. They offer the entire library for a much less price and take monthly payments too!
0	I did notice the audible problems with this 5.1 master and I have come to the conclusion,that after they "REMASTER" something they just don't listen to it.   I own more than 200 disc's of surround material and all of the bad ones have been released within the last 5 years . it's not the format thats bad it's just the record labels wrecking it.
0	clicked the wrong key hated the music garbage realy not worth listening too ok you want more word,s I realy wish the heck amazon would make thing,s easer for us guy,s who are tec chalanged to order music
0	the music sucks only got it because it was free
0	The Up soundtrack won an Oscar and two Grammies but Disney only released it in lossy formats such as MP3 or the AAC files availalable from itunes. This dismal Disney marketing strategy ignored customers who enjoy listening to music with the best available sound quality.  Recently, Intrada has released a CD of the Up soundtrack. This is a limited edition of 10,000 copies. Thank you Intrada.
0	I didn't know that this was a telenovela thing and was completely disappointed. I wanted to get a traditional mariachi music dvd with a female singer for my daughter and searched in amazon and found this dvd before anybody had written a review on it. Within few minutes of dvd, male and female singers started taking off clothes and lying in beds while singing so had to turn it off right away! To make it worse, the singing and acting were just so cheezy and unbearable. I have not even touched this dvd ever since then. Instead, I found a dvd of Linda Ronstad's "Canciones de mi Padre" which turned out to be just what I was looking for! So the lesson is, research and know what you are getting!
0	I'm really disappointed by Flyleaf's new album. I'm a huge fan of their debut and their live shows, and I've realized that they're diehard Christians longtime ago, but I didn't expect this.  Memento Mori seems to be a desperate attempt to turn Flyleaf fans into religious fanatics. So unfortunately it's definitely not suitable for non-religious people as opposed to their first album.  The vocals are as beautiful as always, the music kind of simple, not very interesting. Memento Mori seems to be all about the message of the songs. Beautiful lyrics made room for simple phrases in order to help everyone understand what this is really about: God, Jesus, martyrs. Pathetic.
0	Warning -- the two songs listed as "Little Steve" were written by him but are not the originals nor performed by him!
0	didn't notice it was only one saw CD
0	i personlly think this song sucks not really country either
0	There is no question that the cast of Glee has shown to do more in the way of cover songs, than opting to really have original material all their own. It truthfully has had its shares of highs and lows because of this method. But, now they've chosen to take in a piece of the pie that Susan Boyle had shown with Glee's rendition of I Dreamed A Dream from The Music Of Glee: Volume 3. Glee's version just doesn't feel like the way it was when Susan took to the stage for the first time on Britain's Got Talent, and just drove the shock around the world home. It feels like it has a lack of strong chemistry in the interface of the song. Glee dreamed their dream, but it doesn't feel like it is serenity.  Song: D
0	I saw Bruno Mars on the Grammy Awards and thought he was great -- real James Brown -- great horn section. I ordered his CD and there were no horns. What a disappointment. Maybe he will do a live album and include a horn section.
0	I know the song is great but I have not been able to get it to work yet from Amazon Not too happy
0	Too stylized.  Doesn't sound like what Irving Berlin intended to me.  Why can't the standards just be sung the way they are written?
0	I did not know he sang so many of the songs that I love. Awesome CD!!?
1	Let Go is a song you will listen to over and over.  Anointed. It is a reminder to give everything over to God and to stop holding on where God has said He would come in and carry the burden.  My hubby listens to this song three or four times in a row when it comes up on his playlist.
1	Great cd
1	And why not. Bonnie Raitt's voice is subtle and sexy. The message is profound. The song pleases. Truly. I listen to it over and over again and don't get tired of it. Thank you Bonnie!
1	Great song to get you moving.  I enjoy songs that make me want to get up and dance and this song absolutely does that.
1	ALTHOUGH THESE RECORDINGS ARE OLD AND NOT UP TO THE STANDARDS OF MODERN STEREO RECORDINGS, IT DOES CAPTURE THE BEAUTY OF TAUBER'S VOICE. THE SELECTION OF TRACKS IS EXCELLENT.
1	what's there not to like about it?
1	I absolutely love this album. Each song is beautifully written.
1	I downloaded this cd about a week ago and after i burned it i haven't stopped listening to it.. every song on the whole cd is worth listening to. 50 cent is the man, on Back Down he goes at ja rule the whole song,  so buy it download it burn it do whatever just get this cd its worth 10 stars
1	Great for a free promotional MP3 over an hour, and under a $1. Yard work and my normal exercise routine made easier. The mix motivates and sets a pace. Simple and short transitions, but with a casually flowing familiar "Ibiza" sound. 4 Stars due to it's mainstream feel.
1	I love this song. It makes me feel good. I really don't like Taylor Swift, but I have to admit I love this song.
1	Nirvana is an explosion of rock and all the grunge crap u could wish for. For the first time Smells like teen sprit came on i've been waiting to get a guitar.  All you nirvana haters obviously don't know good music when they hear it. The whole beauty of nirvana is the raw sound. It doesnt matter that its not complicated guitar solos Cause thats not wat matters.  I wish i would have been old enough to go a concert. Once u learn what the lirics r it all comes together "I feel stupid and contagoes here we r now entertain us" perfect.  Alot of people think that nirvana sux because kurts lyrics are about true things that he experienced. Not about other things. But isn't that wat music is about? expressing your emotions. thats wat kurt does and it tells a story of his life.  Or mabye u hate it cause of the perfectness or because of the raw tune that does not change during the solos witch actully have more than instrument so its not a freakin' solo....  some people think kurt was a bad person because of the drugs and suicide. but if u look beyond that u will see that he was a fun loving guy that loved his life(until he got on drugs)Also he never would have got on the drug seen if someone would have taught him about about the harmful effects of drugs.  His mental ishues and abusive parents screwed him up. But his music was good...  n  ni  nir  nirv  nirva  nirvan  nirvana  nirvan  nirva  nirv  nir  ni  n
1	Love Amazon's mp3 buying options, the quality and ease of use was just like having the cd.  Downloaded and synesnched with Itunes instantly. Plus my 6 year old is thrilled to have this song.
1	Worked just fine to get her ready for her audition for her school talent show.  She is 7 years old.
1	Great music
1	Fast delivery good cd
1	pretty song
1	I love it but I was looking for "What Does It Take", the song from the John Cusack movie "One Crazy Summer" and unfortunately the track titles are off a bit.  Track 7 is wrongly titled Piano Solo when it is actually What Does It Take.  In other words, Tracks 7 and 8 are flipped.  If you want Honeymoon Suite's greatest hit, buy Track 7 or maybe Amazon will fix it so it will be the free Prime cut like it was supposed to be...
1	Its a great song that helped me when I was in a place where I thought I was unloved, God never stops.
1	With or without the Eagles Don Henley is GREAT!  This just happens to be my favorite Don Henley song that has a very special meaning behind it for me.
1	Great
1	Jackson 5 always delivers!
1	I purchased their first album and it "blew me away".  This second album is equally great.  Definitely would recommend it.
1	Love this track.  I agree with the first reviewer: it doesn't seem to fit in with the other tracks on the album... wish there were more with this same raw, bluesy rock flavor.
1	Gude Toon. Welcome addition to my pop tune list. Bought thru Amazon Mp3. No problems with the download ar playing.
1	Every morning, we get the children ready for school, preschool, or playgroup.  We can't find a shoe, we can't find a jacket, we need to run back for a bottle.  But we never loose Vered's CD.  We never forget Vered's CD. Each child has his or her favorite song, and every child loves Good Morning My Love. We have Music Together, we have Disney princess, we even Bob the Builder's Mambo #5, but only Vered's Hands in my Mouth gets them all singing together, waving their hands in their air.  And shouting 'better than spaghetti.' The three year old, simply can not start her day until we play 'good morning my love', she has taught all of her classmates.  And her teachers now have a copy of the CD for their class. The six year old, heads into his first grade classroom, swinging to "Mommy don't leave me."  Its a cd, that I can attest is fun for everyone, and we really love hearing everyday.
1	Ran across this via YouTube where it was combined with scenes from the movies to make a great collage.  Song fun just on its own as well.
1	good song, easy download. might actually purchase the cd based on this song alone. thank you for the easy way to download songs.
1	Theres nothing like a perfect mp3 download and this is certainly it!  Thanks and i do look forward for more!
1	I love r. Kelly and this song was back in the days when bumping and grinding was ok and you didn't worry about stalker
1	used it for my daughters wedding. Sounded great threw the church speekers
1	I love this piece. I'm not a classical fanatic, but I do enjoy various playlists on youtube at night, when studying, and I even play it for my dogs while I'm out of the house. This is a nice, soothing piece that blends together well.
1	A beautiful song.  Adele didn't disappoint.  I liked this song the first time I heard it.  Was so glad to find it on Amazon and at a good price too.
1	Akira Senju's work for Mobile Suit Victory Gundam is no doubt one of the best and strongest aspects of an otherwise uneven and often abysmal show, similar to how Elliot Goldenthal's score for ALIEN 3 was easily the best aspect of that particular uneven and almost depressing production.  Thousand Nests is a collection of suites, much like Symphonic Suite Z Gundam, which have various pieces of music from the show arranged in a manner that creates a flow of moods and an outline of sorts for the story.  Personally, I think that the score for Victory Gundam is one of the most beautiful scores in the entire Gundam franchise, similar to how Elliot Goldenthal's score for ALIEN 3 is the most beautiful score in that franchise, but that is a comparison for another time...or another review or something.  Having listened to the three individual volumes of the score for Victory Gundam, I can recognize some of the individual tracks heard in this symphony and how that are arranged.  While it doesn't contain all of the individual tracks from the entire score, Thousand Nests does contain the most recognizable and prominent tracks, and they are arranged so that they flow into each other almost flawlessly.  Suite I contains Woods of the Fatherland and part of Act of War.  Woods of the Fatherland, by the way, is one of my favorite music tracks in the series score, and I personally find it to be one of the most beautiful tracks in the entire franchise. Suite II contains Shakti and V Gundam, both of which can be found on Volume One of the score on their own.  both tracks are named after important characters from the show.  Shakti is named after one of the main female protagonists, while V Gundam is named after, well, the titular mobile suit itself.  Shakti is a quiet yet mournful piece, while V Gundam is a rousing march.  It is my favorite theme for an individual Gundam as well, second only to Nu Gundam from Char's Counterattack. Suite III contains, I believe, Awakening Souls, either the first half of Act of War or A Spring Feast in Summer, and Opening the Gates, along with a segment of Those Who Failed To Become Echoes.  It is a very somber track, evocative of the horrors wrought by the Zanscare Empire. Suite IV contains Illusion of the Forecasting Harvest, along with part of Trembling Lives and Ordered to Advance While Wearing A Blood-Soaked Obi. Suite V contains a portion of Don't Sleep...Here Come The Messengers of Dementia, along with Silence and Fairies Existing During the Sleep. Suite VI contains Young Boy, The White Ghost, and Wind Blows...in that order.  All three of these tracks can be found on their own on Volume One, but the way they are interwoven here is just beautiful. Suite VII contains Slipping Down Sheet, along with Waves Disrupting The Surface. Suite VIII contains Opening The Gates, A Spring Feast in Summer, a portion of Spirit of Earth Leaving For Space, mixed with a small portion of the last part of Don't Sleep...Here Come The Messengers of Dementia. Suite IX, my favorite, contains Pulsation, a portion of Trembling Lives, and an interesting segue into The Afternoon After The Sleepless Night Fair, creating one of the most beautiful suites in the entire symphony.  All in All, I highly recommend this CD.
1	Love this song!
1	Steve Goodman is an All-American folk legend.  This CD is representattive of his brilliant song writing!!!
1	Great song with a nice crunchy guitar hook.  Will definitely be checking out more music from this band.  By the way,  Scott Weiland says that'll be 5 bucks for the use of the bullhorn vocal sound FX.......still very cool, though.
1	It's about time someone creates something original. I'm so sick and tired of hearing the same thing on radio. Tripsitter sound is like a trip on nostalgia. They have an original sound while using spices from the Beach Boys and the Beatles but their main ingredient is original song writing. I don't believe there's anything modern out there like it. Not only that but the songs are actually good. They're well-written and their catchy.  They don't rely on the boom-boom of over-produced tracks like most "pop" music. California Son and the first album take you back to a time when songwriters did things the classic way, you know when they simply wrote good music.
1	Absolutely love this song! Bring Me The Horizon has been one of my all-time favorite bands for a while, and they just keep getting better and better!
1	Never heard a Mavericks album I didn't like. This one is outstanding, too. Buy it now!
1	great music
1	Love this CD.  Why don't we see more of this kind of music?  I am a definite country music fan.
1	This CD is awesome!  Let The Church Rise is a passionate song about how we can change the world.  You Reign is a wonderful praise song and great for meditation as well.  You can't go wrong with this CD.
1	Had it been released at the time it was produced, things would have been different. Karen's voice. Billy Joel's band. It worked!
1	nice song
1	love it
1	Awesome!!
1	Liked this song and singer from the first time I have ever heard her,nice dance music and very nice song
1	Love that song!!!!  Robert couldn't have done it better!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Love this album and this is one of the best songs, somehow missed this song in all my downloads but glad to have it now
1	This is perfect rendition. I found this song because it was written about in a book I was reading and I wanted it. I had also heard it on the radio and was looking for the perfect rendition and this is it.
1	As I write this review "[B.M.F.A]" plays on ... again. In addition to being one the best of the best songs in this album -both lyrically and musically- this potentially controversial tune can lead you to appreciate everything that's great about Martha Wainwright's full-length debut. To begin, it shows the impressive dramatic range she can reach wit her voice, managing to be authentically vulnerable, sincerely outraged and hopeful to reach, perhaps, who the song's about -which from reading some recent reviews may be her father Loudon, whom she has dedicated this song to in concerts. Vocal talents that are also powerfully displayed in many other songs, specially in the beautiful Pop and wrenching lyrics of "Factory," the longing of "Far Away," and the honesty of "TV Show." In no way less important to what makes this music so moving are, of course the lyrics -penned by her except for "Whither I Must Wander"- which can go from raw confessions (No idea how it feels to be on your own / In your own home / With the f***ing phone / And the mother of gloom / In your bedroom / Standing over your head / With her hand in your head). Or her wondering in "Wild Flowers" that "they are like those children / who go off to school and don't come back / and I am like their mother / waiting around about to crack," yet accepting that "these wild flowers are coming up wild." Praise must be given too to the  arrangements and production -she co-produced- which are rather fitting for what Martha has to say, knowing when to remain understated or propel her voice further. All in all, this is a marvelous album. The work of a young woman with nothing to apologize for and the strong intention to make war or to make peace with us, depending on what she needs to say. Caressing or jolting us as it's needed for us to listen closely. Much is being said about her predisposition for talent, given her family's musical might -whether you think of father Loudon, her mother Anna McGarrigle, or her bro Rufus. I'm convinced that the abundant greatness in her songs is hers to claim. She's more her own voice that an extension of their genes. Her talent, the pretty and painful sides of it, is her gift and, clearly her mission to share.
1	Great song for a great movie! One of the best Bonds I've ever seen, so nice to have this epic story reborn and with such gusto!!
1	Great CD! We listen to it often and take it in the car...the musical arrangements are fantastic....the video and lighting are also well done
1	The gypsy spirit is a spirit of wanderlust. It is an exotic blaze of color as the skirts of fandango dancers dart by. It is the mystery of a dark evening lit only by a brilliant, luminous moon. But most of all, it is the shimmering sounds of the sexy, passionate, gypsy guitar. These sensual musical sounds are inspired by the multicultural influences of the nomadic gypsy spirit. As gypsies wandered through Europe they gathered bits and pieces of musical heritage - especially the ardent flavor of hot-blooded Mediterranean countries - and made them their own. The crickets sing; a fire blazes; romance is in the air. Listen as the sultry feel of the gypsy guitar and the enchantment of a late night rendezvous are brought together in "Candlelight."    The rhythmic magnetism of the Spanish guitar blends with the rhythmic allure of the transient ocean in "Home Across the Sea." You can practically see a Spanish galleon's sails fluttering in the wind. You can almost feel the bracing delight of the sea air on your skin. In an instant, the thrilling enchantment of life on the ocean is clear as the crystalline sea. The scintillating, lyric lilt of torrid gypsy dance music makes "Gypsy Caravan" an electrifying, dynamic musical journey. As the caravan rolls through, the flavor of the typsy essence permeates the night breezes.    The wayfaring gypsy is the quintessence of the free spirit in all of us. Free to go anywhere, bound by nothing, gypsies wandered the countryside and borrowed musical flavors from the places they traveled. The chose the most ardent, passionate, sensual sound to creat a brilliant musical hodgepodge. Let the music of Richard Friedman's guitar infuse you with the gypsy vitality!
1	I love this song! Nick's voice is so hot! It is always my ringtone around Valentine's Day! I do wish him and Jess were still together but I still love it!
1	Love her music very anointed singer.
1	The strange, haunting, and brilliant "Bubba Ho-Tep" is my favorite in the horror genre. It actually touches several genres and isn't that easy to classify, of course, much like the soundtrack to the film by Brian Tyler who not only composed all the music, but performed all the instrumental and vocal parts on the soundtrack as well. I truly feel that the movie is immensely more powerful thanks to this music, a statement that can be made about most films, but in this case especially. The music ranges from straight rock and roll on "One Bad Ho-Tep", to surf music on "PBBS", to scary haunting Egyptian chantings in tracks such as "Elder Hole", to fifties slow dance pop on "The Shady Rest." Of all the music on the CD, though, the best is the classic theme found in several variations throughout the soundtrack, notably on "The King's Highway", and "Bubba Ho-Tep End Title Themes." When you see this movie be sure to watch the special feature on Brian Tyler and the making of the soundtrack. This edition is an autographed edition, and costs a bit more and is scarce, but the same musical material is available without the signatures at a lower price. I am not generally a fan of soundtracks, but once you see the movie, and hear the music, I think you will understand why I make an exception here. I highly recommend this CD.
1	Very good song.  I was not familiar with Kongos until the Universal Orlando Resorts commercial featuring this song.  Really love it!
1	Phillip is very talented, but as I listened to the CD I couldn't shake his Dave Matthews influence and I started to feel like I was listening to a DMB cover group. I'd love to hear Phillip really find his own sounds.
1	Great song!!!
1	cant listen to it enough
1	When I find myself unable to sleep for any reason, I've got a solution...  1)  A sleep mask (I get mine from from "Magellan" but you can find similar neoprene (think "scuba suit") formed masks from other places, including Amazon... see here:  https://www.amazon.com/Bedtime-Bliss-BTB01-Contoured-Comfortable/dp/B00FJQFJX8/ref=zg_bs_3764231_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=WSX39XV45Z3HW3PXB1H8 )  AND...  2)  My phone, and a good quality (and COMFORTABLE) set of earphones, playing this on a continuous loop.  I could sleep through a planetary disaster with those two things, I suspect!
1	The reviews of the original stage production described the Wiz as a Wow!  The same can be said of Diana Ross' finally released "Songs From The Wiz".  Her performances are powerful, tender, passionate and artful.  Miss Ross is particularly effective on the show's ballads.  "Be A Lion" and "Is This What Feeling Gets?" are stunning.  The biggest surprise is her rendition of "The Feeling We Once Had" which is delivered with convincing and moving warmth.  She also gives spirited versions of "You Can't Win" and "Everybody Rejoice".  Diana Ross has the unique ability to sing a song (regardless of how familiar) and make it her own.  She seems at times and on the appropriate selections to channel nuances of both Michael Jackson and Lena Horne.  The project concludes with Miss Ross' interpretation of "Home".  It is, as intended, a "showstopper".  Diana Ross once again performs with the inspired authority that only a true DIVA can!  WOW!
1	I've heard this song for years and loved it.  The video was fantastic with the guy dressing as a woman and stealing in that convenience store.  The song itself is just too fun with its unapologetic view of stealing and the fun that it makes it seem.  Great sound and love the barking dogs.
1	Cool jams and hot riffs take you on a trip through 8 tunes that will keep  your head bobbing and your fingers tapping all day long.  Their influences  are close enough to the surface to let you know where they're coming from,  yet the music remains original enough to let you know this is a band like  no other.  Music lovers of all genres will enjoy this first CD from the  College Station, TX quartet.  Get it now, and you'll be able to say,  "I knew them when..." because this band is definitely going  places.
1	Pop music is loaded with auto-tune and "singers" who wouldn't know real singing if it smacked them in the face.  In an industry filled with Justin Biebers and Taylor Swifts, it's such a relief to hear a real artist.  Emeli Sande sings with a real passion on this CD.  When my daughter heard her sing, she was in shock that a singer could sound that good without auto-tune.  The sad truth is that up until the 90's, there were many great singers.  They didn't all look like models, but they had real talent, creativity, and a vision.  Now, people seem to be satisfied with pretty faces and cookie-cutter songs.  When I heard Emeli sing on You Tube, I bought her CD immediately.  Not every song is my taste, but he voice is fantastic. If her music catches on, maybe we will see  more real singers and we can finally kick Justin and Taylor to the curb. P.S.  I also like that Emeli is classy.  She doesn't dress like a prostitute.  She doesn't have to--her voice does all of the talking for her.
1	Outstanding effort. It's so rare to have world class musicians that can play instruments and carry a tune vocally. They're one of the few truly great acts to see live so do it while you still can!
1	Layla is a great song...  Can't go wrong.  The sound quality is good too.  I would recommend this for sure.
1	TOP and GREAT !
1	Great collection! Another Winner for Uncle Charlie Wilson!! A Must Have!
1	Cat Stevens (now Yusef Islam) is one of the best Folk singer/songwriters of his generation.  Though he now goes by Yusef  Islam and frankly looks like a member of a terror cell, his music still touches you.  Teaser and Firecat, the album from which Peace Train,  Moonshadow and Morning Has Broken come is still one of the all time greatest .
1	I can't stop listening to it. It is so good.
1	Can't stop singing it!
1	I love Maroon 5. They never disappoint.
1	It took a couple listens, but this has become probably my favorite album from Daughter, and from 2016 so far!
1	Another rock song that is a must in every collection!
1	I just keep thinking about all the money I saved, buying this album. After I enjoy the music. The best deal of the day for me, and it happens too be a FRIDAY..
1	This album completely lives up to my high expectations after their long hiatus! If anything I'm just disappointed it's not longer. The tracks are diverse and show the musicians' individual growth, which has wonderfully made them a stronger trio in spite of the time apart. Thank you Nickel Creek for this album!
1	Great CD!
1	nice and very calm song. Relaxes my mind when I listen. Little expensive but worth having in my music collection
1	This long yoga nidra session is very relaxing. Robin Carnes has a very soothing voice that guides you smoothly into deep relaxation.
1	The remastered quality of the music is fantastic. Paul McCartney sure takes care of his fans. He is a living legend.
1	Put it on my KindleFire so I can have it at my fingertips where ever I am.  Wonderful songs and piano playing
1	This song makes me cry every time, I love it.
1	Great album. This is one of a classical favorite.
1	Excellantlly produced. Takes me to the cross and the great sacrifice Jesus made just for me, and His continual GRACE that has endured throughout my lifetime.
1	i always loved the bad boys!!!
1	The album as a whole continues to grow on me
1	I am a 3pointer but the flow and teaching are good. It's a blessing to see God move in and grow Christian rap the way He has. Shai stay faithful and keep it coming. Thank you for allowing God to use you.
1	love this song
1	First heard this song on an episode of NCIS and had to track it down. Lovely melody and sound, and beautiful lyrics.
1	Great buy, would deal with them again!
1	What guitar player didn't listen to this and imagine themselves standing in the spotlight, being the envy of everyone watching. You had to be exceptional anyway to work with Edgar Winter who convinced Ronnie to do this tune. It's one of those songs that guaranteed you got the girl if you could pull it off live.
1	I fel into the world of Big Vizion by way of one of my favorite reggae groups, Jah Works. I don't know what it is about Big Vizion that makes me like him so much, but I do. I am not what you consider a "hip-hop" fan...I like songs here and there, but for the most part, I am a total white boy who is addicted to guitar. That said, I think Big Bizion's knowledge of other genres of music other than hip-hop(most notably funk and reggae) makes this a classic album for anybody who thinks their music taste leans towards diversity and genre-blending. If you go in thinking Big Vizion is going to sound like your typical "cookie cutter" rapper you will be sorely disappointed. If you like your artists to be diverse and take chances then Big Vizion is for you, and check him out.
1	Don't be so quick to discount this band because they are known for questionable themes, lots of yelling and fuzz on the old guitar.  While vocals sometimes betray their possessor, the harmonies are flawless and compelling.  Good chords form a basis for excellent composition.  In many of the bands I was in we NEVER had this much sophistocation, they're definitely doing more than the 1,5,4 or a perhaps a 1,6,2,4,5.  No regrets buying this for my 12 year old.
1	Keith Harkin is the best!!!!  By himself or with Celtic Thunder.  I love his own music, but when he sings old standards he really makes them his own.
1	Beautiful music!
1	awesome music!
1	This is a really nice work in combination with Nicki Minaj. Alicia has an incredible voice and it shows! You have to download it!
1	Reminds me of a love song. But one created for me and my first love: Jesus..Oh lord how I love being with you :)!
1	I wanted the edited version of this song, and it was hard to tell if this one was when I bought it. In case anyone else is wondering like I was, it is edited like the one played on the radio.
1	This is the music of my college years in Holland, MI. Erik is an amazing musician and songwriter as well as a hell of a nice guy. I still love this album, more than 20 years later.
1	Oh boy. Why this is not available on cd beyond me! Esoteric eccentric pure punk from the 80s. Up up baby Judy up up!
1	I'm not a DB fan by any means, i am more into late country. However this song is better than anything else they have put in the radio.  Very sincere and heart felt... lot better than hearing about drinking beer and riding in trucks.
1	Fun tune from the 80's ... who could forget it in Vacation!
1	I love this remake of the Jackson 5 hit
1	Great CD. Great songs with meaning. Will uplift you! Especially like "Worn." It says so much about life today, and gives encouragement.
1	Adele is great, she thinks out her words and put every one of them into the right way. Her songs are beautiful.  I love her a lot.  Continued luck to Adele.
1	Jack White's guitar playing is unbelievable! He always seems to amaze me!  The White Stripes were phenomenal. I wish they never broke up.  :(
1	Get this before dear Amy is gone, whether from the business or from the earth. She is a shooting star for sure.  Whatever ineffable quality all the greats had, who died young and left legends, she has it. Oh, does she have it. What a voice. What a talent. Nothing has impressed me so much in years. What shocks most, however, is how a slightly trashy, working-class girl, seemingly drunk and strung out at all times, could pen these tremendous lyrics. Her inteviews do not suggest at all her level of poeticism and wisdom. In this respect, she reminds one of John Lennon or Tupac Shakur, who could give daft interviews, nearly making fools of themselves, and then go home and write lyrics of staggering brilliance. I fear that Amy may soon join John and Pac above, if she keeps up her drunken ways.  A note about the production: nearly all the tracks on this album were mixed for car stereos and cheap box systems, featuring flabby, inflated bass and splashy, ear-piercing treble. I believe the producers were trying to reproduce an early sixties, Phil Spector sort of sound (mono, wall of sound), but they should have listened harder and on something other than worn-out turntables. This period sound does not have to be so low-fi and so artificially bass-heavy.
1	Classic.
1	My daughter loves the show, James and all the songs. She was so happy to get this cd, she sings to it all the time. I know she would recommend this to any big time rush fan.
1	I bought the whole soundtrack but this is absolutely my favorite song on the album. It is also the song that was featured in the preview for the movie. Love.
1	I love it
1	This is a great song.  now I have it on my phone.  Must have for any ND fan. Go Irish!
1	great song with good message in it
1	My dad had this Les Mangelepa album on LP when I was a little kid in the 80's. I remember listening to these songs and I cannot describe the feeling I get out of hearing this again. Just amazing! Thank you Amazon for making this available. I never thought I could find and buy this music on amazon by simply clicking.
1	Damn good album, buy it now.
1	Love the show, love the group, really like the album.  A bit too commercial, but it *is* a Nick show.
1	Not much to say except Wayne totally kills it in this song.  Definitely in his prime in this one and I'd highly recommend it.
1	It was this song that Johnny Crawford sang on one of the Rifleman episodes that I realized he had a great voice!  Since then, I am trying to keep up with his band on the Internet and have downloaded several of his songs and I love every one of them.
1	Great EP
1	Love this 80's classic
1	Great album!
1	Good movie
1	I haven't heard it for years, but it still makes the same impression as it did in those days.  Now I have to figure out how to download the album into my prime music library.
1	Great track !
1	Awesome song.
1	Probably my favorite Tenth Avenue North CD. They're my favorite Christian band so it's hard to choose just one CD! I have them all. Always feel encouraged after listening.
1	Based upon a haunting flute, a rhythm guitar, and staccato bass hits from a synth of sorts, we have a funky dance tune - and a very haunting song full of lyrical imagery.  At the New Moon Born Review, I had made a comparison between Jana and Sting. Jana also has a very similar lyrical style with Tony Banks of Genesis (circa 1980's). The difference is Jana expresses her feelings through lyrical imagery whereas Tony Banks expressed I don't know what.  For this reason, I also wonder if "Out the Window" is an intro to "From A TightRope" as a form of rock musical imagery (out the window onto a tightrope). If so, I wish there was a better flow between the songs.  From A TightRope seems to capture a gloom and doom feeling about the world wherein the "tightrope" is the straight line you have to walk. But that line is "wavering, suspended in mid-air," so you're constantly in danger of falling into that gloom and doom world. That's my interpretation. Someone try to do better.  "Never Fall" at New Moon Born Seems to be the healing antithesis of "From A TightRope." The laid back, relaxed Reggae Rhythm tells me I'm right. Thanks, Jana. You have flooded my mind with your intense lyrical and musical imagery!
1	i wish they did not make us do reviews on songs , everyone is different . and who know who else would like it !
1	love this song
1	I heard this for the first time the day my Dad died and it has always been a comfort for me. LOVE IT! I know when he met Jesus he probably felt the way this song expressed.
1	Just started listening to these discs. All I can say to those who rated this low, and say his voice is gone, etc. is that you are not hearing what is on these discs. It's not how his voice sounds, it's how it makes you feel. By all means, if you don't like what you're hearing, don't listen. But I would say that any Stephen Stills fan who can let this music/voice in, will be rewarded with some of the best music from an old soul you will ever hear. It's simply as good as it gets. Reminds me of why we have ears in the first place!
1	Always loved this song
1	Whooooooooo!!! I've been missing out. Just stumbled upon this song tonight and can't stop listening to it. You can buy the music video from their website crossmovement.com.
1	great song from a great new artist, can't wait to see her live
1	Tom Waits, has to be the slickest, hippest song writer that has ever walked the earth. Between the lyrics and the melodies he gives the downtrodden, the wildly insane and the prostitute their own genre of music. His music is a marvelous, colourful mixture of madness, evil and lunacy. His ballads are haunting and beautiful.  My own personal favourites are the morosely haunting  "Diamonds & Gold" and the painful melodey from the song "Hang Down Your Head".....  He makes the downtrodden, the weak and the profoundly unhappy seem beautiful and melodious. He brings a vision to the music and a cerebral voice to the lost.....  I think that he is the most underated musician in America.  He is just beautiful.man with a wonderful craft.....his music is like Alexander McQueen's (2003) Shipwreck "Oyster" dress...torn, tattered, haunting, melodious and surprising lilting and beautiful.  I am thankful for both Tom Waits and the fashion visionary that was once Alexander McQueen...
1	Great.
1	I'd heard the live performance of New Shoes and it blew me away. Of course, I Googled the song and his name and this 19 year old guy from Scotland popped up. Needless to say my jaw dropped. Listening to the live version of new shoes anyone would guess that he's a 60 year old Delta blues man.  Of course I ran out and bought the cd. However, on cd his voice is much smoother but great never the less. There are some great songs on this cd. Listening to them it really makes us remember that he is only 19 as his slow songs are so sweet without bitter and his upbeat songs are fun.  This guy is a true musician.
1	Music was my first love. I tried to learn to play this song from The Judy Collins Songbook when I wanted to drift away from whatever beat everybody's different drum was supposed to impose an institutional time and space on life as we know it. That makes this a great song for me.
1	Great download
1	Love this cd.
1	I love this CD. Has more music than other CDs that feature music from Downton Abbey. Has soothing music but also has more upbeat music. I find this music very soothing, esp when I want to go to sleep to music. Highly recommend, esp for those that loved watching Downton Abbey.
1	I am Titanium, hence, I love this song.
1	Everything Bonnie does is exceptional
1	I use to have the record and during all the moves it was lost.  Brings back lots of good memories. Amazing how many people have never heard of them, but once you hear their music they love it.  If you are over 65 you may remember the good times also. highly recommended for us older folks . Remember when times were simpler.
1	cool
1	I can't praise David Werner's self-titled third album enough. His eponymous album from 1979 is nothing short of a Power Pop masterpiece. "Power Pop" to me defines smart, catchy, guitar-driven melodies best enjoyed on a summer drive or a day at the beach. When I think of Power Pop bands, Cheap Trick, Big Star, The Raspberries, early Nick Lowe, and The Knack. David Werner, with the three albums he released (Whizz Kid, Imagination Quota, and David Werner) fits comfortably alongside them.  There's really not a bad song on the album. From start to finish, every song is laced with catchy melodies, harmonies, and diverse instrumentation. "Melanie Cries" is a prime example. One of the few mellow songs on the album, starting with a hypnotic bass line, guitar, keyboards, and lush vocals reminiscent of The Association and to a lesser degree, the Beach Boys. The rest of the album is straight ahead rock, reminiscent of Graham Parker, Southside Johnny, with little bits of Marc Bolan and David Bowie sprinkled into the mix (especially on his first two albums).  I don't see a track listing here on Amazon, so for the record, here it is:  Can't Imagine  (3:38) What's Right  (3:42) What Do You Need To Love  (4:01) Melanie Cries  (4:50) Eye To Eye  (4:52) Hold On Tight  (4:13) Every New Romance  (5:35) Too Late To Try  (2:39) High Class Blues  (4:07) She Sent Me Away  (4:31)  Why this album never made it, I don't know. Why it's not available as a legal download in this day and age is a mystery as well. (I did see that&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/What-s-Right/dp/B004TBX0SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">What's Right</a>&nbsp;is available as part of a collection.)  I will say, however, this album has aged better than much of the music that came from the same timeframe, and preferable to what's out on the scene today. It's definately a classic that deserves to see the light of day again as an official release.
1	Who does not love and appreciate Santana.
1	great
1	What good taste Amazon customers have!  I was amazed at the number of "5 star" reviews for this record. Let me add mine to the list. By far, this was the finest album of the late-90's. Over the months since its  release, I have purchased about 2 dozen copies of Mezzanine, bestowing this  gift of genius on friends and family alike - for any gift-giving occasion I  can think of! Rarely does a CD hold the power to fundamentally alter my  mood. And although this record can be "dark" and contemplative,  the mood I usally end up in after listening to Mezzanine is a good one.  Listening to music this daring and innovative can't help but brighten  anyone's spirits! The only experience better than listening to Mezzanine at  home was having the privelidge of seeing Massive Attack perform the record  live and in person. A MUST see... A MUST buy...  A MUST have.
1	my wifes
1	Its OK - decent quality recordings of standard classical selections but nothing special. I really have only listened to a few of the pieces. As I have gotten old, music no longer excites me the way it used to..
1	nice beat loops, reminiscent of 80's beat loops.
1	it takes me back when i was a teenager hanging out with my girlfriend,I love the oldies but goodies thanks
1	That's what happens everytime I hear this song. Anaysha sings with such conviction that the words make me focus and reflect on my life and walk in Christ.
1	What's not to like about Willie Nelson? Each time he releases another album, his creativity gets better. Well worth having.
1	The counting part fits the typical suicide ritual cycle feeling of weekly body counts to keep track of how much we were sacrificing for freedom. I was impressed by parents being called on to be the first ones on their block to have their boy come home in a box. If anybody thinks laws apply to everybody, that goes double for music like this.
1	It is the act ual so ng fr om the gam e. Ma kes an am az ing ring tone.
1	You said it all Beautiful thats just what my girl is Beautiful, Terrific Album, whoever does not know of Teena Marie just listen to once of her songs and you will be addicted to her music. The Best. Very missed.
1	im pretty sure the best pirate song i ever heard. although based on an alternate realiity, this is probably how the real life of a pirate went
1	I have enjoyed these tracks over and over. The best things in life are free, thank you and Merry Christmas!
1	Its a great song to THANK the Lord! It is on my Ipad most of the times now. I totally love it
1	Any Queen/Freddie Mercury fan (RIP Freddie), cannot NOT have this in their Queen Collection. It's just un thinkable..lol!! Awesome, As usual, song.
1	love vit
1	Good jam
1	Love the CD altogether, but I needed this one song for my Sting collection. Chris Botti is definitely my favorite jazz musician.
1	this is a Beatiful HEBREW Lullaby sung with a family gifted with the voice to sing. Shalom it will Bless you greatly, plus the music is nice too.
1	This was a gift for my wife, and just to see her face light up when she heard it it was delight enough for me to love it, then i got to hear it and loved it
1	This song is wonderful. It makes you feel good when you listen to it. Very humbling emotion when you sing along.
1	Love this song
1	Classic Christian song. A must have for the old CCM collector
1	Bought this song because it is so true.
1	One of my favorites by J.T. !
1	A++
1	I was not familiar with who Dallyn Vail Bayles was and just ran across this recording. I am so glad I did! What a voice and really gives feeling to his song.
1	This is a fun, fast paced song that helps me get myself into a good mood whenever I'm feeling down.
1	sing alongable....is that a word?
1	I had a "Celtic Christmas Sampler" (at least that's what I think it was) CD a long time ago, and I loved this one song on there. Unfortunately, I lost the CD and was sad every Christmas time when I realized that I would never be able to listen to the song (whose name escaped me at the time) again. Purely by chance, I stumbled onto the song on literally the day before Christmas, and I remembered again why I loved this piece so much. It's heart-rendingly gorgeous and truly amazing.
1	I picked up this CD at one of those listening posts a few years ago and I have never tired of it.  It is awesome and so well done.  Every track is excellent.  It is a beautiful combination of native american music and piano that is captivating and never tiring.  I only wish that Paul La Roche had made other CDs.  Maybe someday.  This is a must have.
1	Can't stop singing it...
1	Brought back memories of my teen age years.
1	I only downloaded one song from this album.  It is a powerful song about prison, a condemned man, the warden and a guitar.  What's not to like about that?
1	The actual core Album tracks are great Freddie King. The voice and guitar playing are tremendous.  The Bonus tracks on this are variable but the acoustic playing on "That's all right" made my day.  Buy this if  you could only buy one Freddie King album.  IMHO
1	This was the hottest song in the eighties.  I just love it.  It was great then and even greater now in my opinion.  I wish that the artist from the seventies, eighties and nineties could make a come back and bring back all the good tunes.
1	Beautiful song
1	Hey, Hey, Stevie Ray! Express yourself! Thats all I need to say about this. what else needs to be said?
1	Well All Around Album!
1	great song
1	I have always enjoyed his music
1	Can't  beat classic John Prine.
1	Great song very catchy
1	Heard this song on a mix cd and I been loving it every since,ms Tiara has a beautiful voice cant wait to hear remix with Rude gyrl RiRi
1	This song is soooo true for me.  And what a blessing to listen to.  I can't sit still when it is playing.
1	I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this CD set.  I had purchased the shorter Rivendell album some time ago and was mainly impressed by Christopher Lee's work on a few selections and by a couple of other tracks which he didn't participate.  I had been interested in this set for a while before purchasing it, mainly out of concern for how well the quality could be maintained over 4 CDs.  I should have ordered this sooner as this is a terrific collection of music from beginning to end.  While it would be difficult to picture this music as part of a movie, these compositions are perfect for the books.  The hobbit-centered songs are appropriately upbeat and rustic while other pieces range from sad to terrifying.  There is a sense of unity to the set even though each track can stand on its own.  This is highly recommended for Tolkien fans, though those familiar with the books are more likely to be deeply interested in a complete rendition of the songs which the good professor wrote in this particular tale.
1	Love it. Can't wait for the whole album to drop!
1	I like this song.
1	Very soothing to the soul
1	Mark Knopfler's guitar work lifts this great song about a poor band in a little nightclub with the grand-sounding name.
1	Packs a polka wallop!
1	There is so much that I do like about Sam Smith as a singer. He really has had some excellent songs over the past several years, from the definitive Stay With Me, to Not The Only One. He really has been knocking it out of the ballpark in regards to his songs and heart. But nevertheless, he has a whole lot more to continue to delivering in the way he has had some excellent songs. His latest song, Like I Can, the fourth single from his Grammy-winning album In The Lonely Hour, is a song that works very nicely for him, and delivers very well in the pop style that maybe someone like Phil Collins had developed over the years of his brilliance with songwriting. It is a good song, while I honestly do wish that the song could've been a bit longer to match the mood he set within the song. Still, it is a great treat for those whom have loved Sam's songs before. I sincerely recommend Like I Can to download.  Song: B
1	This song is amazing and very sweet.  Using it as part of a highschool graduation slideshow.  I researched for awhile before deciding!
1	his older music is definitely more countrified, but it's catchy and fun
1	This version of Scarlet Begonias>Fire On The Mountain is probably my most favorite version of all of 1990 and, in fact, most of the rest of the 1990's. Almost 20 solid minutes of what made the Grateful Dead so incredible to see live. After over 500 GD shows and dozens and dozens of versions of these two songs this version is in my top 10 of all time (although I was NOT actually at this concert.)  Unfortunately this entire show was not quite as good and is notable for the first version of the complete Hey Jude since 1969...It was also the last because Brent really botched up the lyrics and as was his moody habit...never attempted it again...
1	This band has been on my top 20 since I first heard of them many many years ago.  I enjoy thier songs and musical aptitude.
1	Excellent.
1	best song
1	Great music.
1	Thanks
1	My wife's favorite song
1	Very good
1	They sing so beautiful, they have the cutest smiles and they enjoy singing for everyone. I would buy more. they're just great!
1	Awesome cd love pixies!
1	As kids my sisters and brothers and I laughed so much at this album, Now,  years later it still made us laugh out loud. This is true comedy ..no F words, No vulgarity..no need for that if you are talented comedians, and Tom and Dick Smothers are TALENTED comedians. And pretty good singers., too. Mason Williams wrote a number of the songs for them..
1	We're enjoying the CD!!  This is more laid back than the first Paul Baloche Christmas album,but very enjoyable.  Especially, if you're trying to help your worship team think through how to create Christmas worship songs incorporating your regular worship tunes.  Also, these are not complicated arrangements so they are accesible to most church musicians.
1	This is one of the best singers of the 80 and I still think he is a wonderful singer glad he still does
1	Beautiful song!  Love it!
1	This song is a must for anyone who grew up in the 80's during the birth of Cable and Mtv.  "I want my Mtv!"
1	This album is filled with so many terrific songs.
1	Top quality work. Some of their best.!!
1	Love this CD
1	I'm constantly hearing incredible songs from Bob Dylan I've somehow never heard before. This was one of them. I wish I knew how one person could write so many good songs.
1	I love it!
1	This was a replacement for a CD that got lent one time too many!  The original Weddings album, with the original lineup. Classic songs, but with 20 years of history behind him as pretty much the sole songwriter, the non-Mick Thomas numbers here stand out like the proverbial dog's balls.  If you're a WPA fan you'll be needing this.  (This was a mint condition original CD release. The reissued version is identical, with no extra tracks. Mick was not consulted on the reissue, and was somewhat peeved when it appeared, saying that, had anyone bothered to ask, he could have supplied heaps of great bonus material)
1	Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone) by Chris Tomlinson is truly amazing. Version of song as it was written, but left this line out for many years.
1	If I had a theme-song, "You're So Vain" would have been it. As a matter of fact, it was. I used to call discotheques before I would arrive and make my entrance while the song was playing.
1	Great album! They have such wonderful voices... I wish I could sing like that.
1	I love Elvis's voice for gospel music and the 2 CD's did not disappoint.
1	Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good.
1	Excellent album and value
1	It is music I like what is with this required number of words non sense - if I did not like it I wouldn't have bought it
1	Great live instrumentation and vocals! The music and talent of this album is awesome, my favorite is "news for you"!
1	If you love Taylor Swift, you're going to love Red. If you weren't already a fan, this isn't a song that's going to make you change your mind.
1	I loved this version. The song was written by Herbie Hancock.  There was a movie by the same name about a bigoted white guy (Is that okay for me to say?) It was written by Herman Raucher (song: the Summer of 42.)  One morning he woke up to find himself black. It was funny but I felt a little uncomfortable sometimes. Godfrey Cambridge was the main character, Jeff Gerber.
1	great deal sounds great would buy again good buy mvto mvto mvto mvto mvto mvto mvto mvto mvto mvto mvto mvto
1	Okay I was shocked when I first played the song....I thought it was going to be a woman based on the cover art. But I can't say I'm disappointed with the song at all. In fact I love love love this song. Its perfect, sweet and beautifully done. I can't wait to listen to more of his music. His voice is awesome. So I strongly suggest downloading this song, especially while its free.
1	This sing just lifts my spirit whenever I hear it.  It's a classic that just makes yoou hopeful and faithful.
1	I'm definitely a 90's baby, so the whole vibe of this song "appeals" to me. lol. Smooth jazz r&b and jazz such as this are always a win in my book!
1	pretty good. I went to HS with Phil and he is bad ass. This is a good cd for busting out ur girl or yanking ur doodle.
1	love  her music.
1	Great disc for quiet Christmas celebrations!!  Great arrangements in the Baroque style.
1	Kids love it!
1	The melodies on this CD are beautiful, enchanting and captivating. Just close your eyes and let the music create peace.
1	Wonderful album for kids and adults, my husband and I enjoy this as much as our kids.  Love the music, lyrics, concept and accompanying DVD. I've recommended it and given it to many.
1	I heard this song on the radio and loved it. It really makes you think if Jesus was never born we would not have Christmas. Jesus is the reason for the season and this song reminds us all of that.
1	as with most of his music Wings is beautiful and relaxing them - I have several of his albums and enjoy them all
1	Pretty good! I like that it has elements of acoustic folk and hard hitting rock. I heard the one song on the radio. The album cover caught my eye ;)
1	great song, love the lirics with a lot of meaning for me.  Will be playing this at my wedding reception
