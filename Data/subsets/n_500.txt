0	The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.
0	After a couple of days, song refused to play. Had to download from another server.
0	When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.
0	I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.  Brandon you should recall this album and act as if it never happened.  I hope the next Killers album sounds NOTHING like this or I will be disappointed.
0	One song for $9.99?  I guess it's my fault that I didn't read the product description, but I was under the impression, for that price, that I was getting a full length cd.
0	Not such a great CD.  Only one selection meets my expectations.
0	I love this song, but the Amazon music app won't play it or save it to my phone.
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your privates chopped off. thats all i have to say, no 50 cent, it isn't my birthday, and we're not gonna party like its my birthday, especially not to your crappy music. have a nice day
0	Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.  I'm kinda disappointed, as the guests did not shine particularly bright either, so i'll give it a 2, maybe a 2.5 No knock on the message, thats great. But I didn't feel that this album was that good overall.
0	Wow geez one good song on this. It's a good song, the best song, but just that one song.
0	I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash. I am not a dyed in the wool Trump fan or anything else but is there ANYTHING positive Roger can say here? I listened to the whole album and found the tracks I liked were the ones that had the same notes as 'Mother' 'Pigs (Three Different Ones)' and 'Have A Cigar' the rest of it was the same as Amused to Death, another album that I found so unnecessarily bleak, I got rid of it. Then I bought it again thinking maybe I was too harsh on it. I never listen to it. This is music to depress yourself to. Who needs that? If I want to be depressed I'll watch the news. I don't need to hear it in my music. Life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race. I much prefer to think of Roger Waters' shining moment to be 'The Tide Is Turning' a truly optimistic song.
0	not to much into the hard rock sound.
0	The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.  Hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range.
0	I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.
0	Not only is she a horrible singer.  She supports cop killers.  She is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video.  Please do not support her!
0	The song is great.  But, this copy has a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song, making it impossible for me to listen to.
0	Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
0	Must have been real drunk when I accidentally purchased this.  Would never listen to it (and I tried).
0	This is a very good song Really pits me mind of New York: Big Sophisticated City Image.
0	It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena. Bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing-along choruses. "Vice Grip", the first single, also follows in this vein. Then we have tracks like "Crushed", which first bites off Heaven Shall Burn, then sounds like they're attempting to be some 3rd rate Rage Against the Machine knockoff. "Writings on the Wall" is a complete joke, with Winston McCall doing a bad attempt at Corey Taylor's angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from Queen's "We Will Rock You", complete with dubbed in violins. Whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity, I actually like the track "Dedicated", as it feels like the least of a departure from their old sound, and "The Sound of Violence" is pretty cool as well.  It's not a complete loss of an album, but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound. I would only recommend this for PD completionists and masochists.
0	censored version, but it had the EXPLICIT label
0	No Rocky Top?!?  Why bother?  That's like warm beer & cold pizza, close but not quite.
0	I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
0	RIP Teleka. This man took your life. I am sorry that people think he some kind of God. But your God will bring you justice someday!
0	Just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around The Starting Line came. they sound exactly like NFG. which isn't good either. and there lyrics are so boring and lame. if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyrics and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
0	I love Ne-Yo but this Album wasn't what I expected
0	GARDIAN - VOYAGER & FUSION (2001 - Millenium Eight Records)    1) Instrumental Intro    2) Voyager    3) Across The Universe    4) Run To The Light (Early version of One Of A Kind)    5) In A World Without Love (Early version of World Without  Love)    6) I Am Here (Tony sings and plays guitar on this track)    7) Prisoners Zone    8) Look To The Future    9) Hyperdrive (Early version of the re-recorded bonus track for First Watch)  10) When The Time Is Right  11) Marching On (Early version of the re-recorded bonus track for First Watch)  12) Spiritual Warfare  13) Miracle Of The Galaxy (Early version of Miracle)  14) Living For The Promise (Early version of Livin' For The Promise)  15) Eclipse (Not on First Watch)  16) Rock In Victory (Early version of Rock In Victory)  17) Step To The Light (Very early version of One Of A Kind)  18) Armored Defense  19) Your Love Looks to the Future  * = Fusion - Rock In Victory (EP) (1984) (Six song EP - but not sure if it is all here?) (I believe only the last three songs are from RIV.)  ? = Gardian - Voyager (1987) (How many tracks on this? Don't know what tracks are from this, and where or what the other tracks Tony Palacios plays on are from (maybe a demoed First Watch tape or something?)  * = From the California Metal (Comp.) (1987)  ? = Demo versions of songs that later ended up on First Watch stuff. Not sure which were on Voyager?  - James Isham was the lead guitarist on Rock In Victory, Tony Palacios was the lead guitarist on all other tracks.   To the best of my ability I only assume Tony is playing on all the flashy George Lynch type guitar stuff. Couldn't find the track listings for Rock In Victory or Voyager. It sounds like Tony's playing on everything except the last 3 tracks (17-19).  - They did say that many of the same songs appear on both Rock In Victory & Voyager . so I believe only half of Rock In Victory is on here?  - So overall this sounds like s* t - BUT some good shredding guitar solos are "hidden" in the mix. Would have been nice if Millenium Eight Records had spent a few bucks "cleaning" this up . Tony shreds!
0	This wasn't what I thought it would be. A lot of the songs I've never heard before.
0	Would like it a lot more if it indeed had all 176 pieces. Mine only downloaded 100.
0	I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea. Ever since 'Untouchables', there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of Korn albums, and for those of you who think I'm dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of Head, both 'Untouchables' and 'Take a Look in the Mirror' featured Head as the lead guitar. 'Untouchables' was a good album, not great. 'Mirror' was still decent, and I'll admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both 'See You on the Other Side' and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album. However, a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album.  I think its safe to say the the "Korn sound" was lost after 'Issues', and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album. When you listen to their early work, the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from "Daddy" on their debut album to "Somebody Someone" off of 'Issues.' With the release of 'Untouchables', the Korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the 1950s. With each track, it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a 'catchy' chorus. This is not to say the albums released since 2000 have been bad, they just aren't worthy of a 5-star rating.  This new release sounds closer to "Mirror" than the last two, but it lacks the creativity that really separated Korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio waves. Does Jon Davis sound angrier on this album than the last two? Yes. Does he growl more? Sure. Are the lyrics memorable. No. Does the music stand out? Not really. I sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because I've been starved for new material, but lately I've been taking the time to really listen before I judge, and I ask myself if I'll feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road. In 6 months, listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and they'll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the CD or turned it on via an MP3 player. They'll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isn't that great.  I don't want to rip the band because they're still one of my favorites, but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression. Either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul. The album is not terrible, but it's unremarkable and candidly, it's also forgettable. My $.02
0	The song is fine, but i absolutely HATE the fact that they talk in the intro, like we are interested in hearing them make a half-hearted attempt at being funny.
0	Music was too high I couldn't use the soundtrack. I tried with my sopranos and they couldn't sing to the soundtrack.
0	Nancy Sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault!  She should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon.
0	actually, it didn't. the first tune was nice, but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasn't restful at all. If anything the cricket noise would keep one awake,and I just found it too irritating.
0	The background is not a Background! You can listen the kids singing
0	I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.)  I have already given the CD away.  I guess if you're a fan of Eminem copycats or ICP, this is the CD for you, but I don't need to listen to poseur white kids rap about "bitches," drugs, and double-D's.
0	I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive. I don't know the timing of this production but 'Big Edie'(Mum) does not seem to take part at all. The appeal of Little Edie had always been her expression, body language, and refreshing vocals; this production did not stimulate at all, and was frankly a little humdrum.
0	i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.this album is slowwwwwed down. tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always been a staple of his music. not everything has to be 300 miles per hour of awesomeness, but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkillers all day before recording either. the dj was completely uninspired. i am used to tech's background mix to be a strong point of this artist. usually a complex mixture of big brass, synthesizers, different time signatures, other genres of music thrown in, and some of the coolest and oddest samplings around, this album rarely showcases anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music. the lyrics are amazing as usual, you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album( the only reason i am giving this a 2 instead of a 1)dont get me wrong there are good tracks on this cd.most of the ANGER part of the cd is pretty good, then slows down horrifically for the last two parts.there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of  album.the song's beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n9ne cds. sounds like tech was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system. not the reason i buy tech n9ne. if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd's that seem to make up most of the market nowadays. like alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his tune to keep up with current times. he now has produced an accessible album for the status quo. i am sure it will sell well.  i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n9ne album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again.
0	Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!
0	IMO, this sounds like something I could've done with a toy saxophone.  Awful.  Listen to the previews.  If you can get passed the samples and think its sounds great, then go for it.
0	Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
0	This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done. I should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement, but I knew this would be the case before buying the album; I expected DA's artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile - and it would have, had I not already had all the songs. The interpretive narration has no artistry and little of what I call "spiritual vision". I really felt like only giving this one star, but DA's songs are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two stars I settled for, were they not better found in their original context (Shotgun Angel).
0	Only perso I know who enjoys this is my cousin , but he is deaf
0	Boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different songs , it's a little different but it's okay
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous albums. Monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangements.
0	Nothing of great interest.  Mostly a vanity project. Quite disappointing, really.
0	for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?) and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out, and bring me down so much that when I was driving so that I'd have to turn it off.  Yes, Mumford's voice is gorgeous, but not enough to save the album. Hey, fame and fortune is tough, but they made it through "27."  I will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited.
0	I was thinking it was the whole song and it was not.
0	Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.
0	I really like the song as I hear it on the radio or see it in the video.  I didn't like the rap in the middle, didn't seem to fit the song.
0	Very disappointed in this CD. It is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many songs, too annoying to listen too.
0	Didn't like this version as much as the original but I still used this for a 50th Class Reunion Power Point presentation.
0	I think it's so good message is great I just love it.i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but This gets all the stars .
0	The song was fine but it downloaded as zip file. I only wanted it to load to my other Amazon music file/windows media of my PC. Now I cannot load the song onto my android phone. I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more Amazon services and absolutely do not make me happy as a customer. Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.
0	Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But. . .I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.
0	I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!
0	Great song, but the download version is only 128kbps. Why is no higher quality version available?
0	To repetative with bells and not much other substance. Does not mesh well with the other instruments. Needs a lot of work.
0	Ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information.  Was not like the picture.  Returned 1st one and ordered a second which was identical to the first.  Also was returned.
0	Think I deserve my money back. This song was labeled as clean, yet upon playing the entire song, there are several profane words.  Wasted my money because I can't listen to it.
0	I really didn't like the music. I expected it to be Christmas themed and exuberant like the other TSO albums I have. The few instrumentals were pretty good, but the other selections were boring.
0	I guess I just expected a lot more from Rob Zombie. this album wasn't anything great. I hope the new movie will blow my socks off!
0	Sorry all you dudes who will flip over this but Using God's name that way over and over is childish and ignorant ! Like the uneducated idiots that can't make a sentence without a foul word in it. Seriously guys its unintelligent !
0	I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves. They'd do anything for "Kurdt" and are easily-lead. Just look at the how they say "listening to it makes me like it". If you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day, would you enjoy THAT? Same concept with these songs. People like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment. Just because you've heard something before isn't necessarily grounds for you to like it.
0	yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more. at least the wu keeps it real. built for cuban links 2 was great. reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music?
0	It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!
0	This should be a lot better. however it isn't. don't waste your money. sorry Brian
0	It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.
0	Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.
0	If it where possible, I would leave zero stars! One of the worst albums I have ever purchased.
0	Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
0	I went through days of singing this over and over.
0	I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's . wish I would have listened to it first . Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to . maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start . oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and I just hope his next CD is much better.
0	you can tell this is not an original, buy the dubbing and sound quality .  I have and original jim Stafford album from the 70s and this is not the same  ouality of sound . sucks this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from England,
0	Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
0	package was sent back originally because it was too damaged.  I had to re-order the product and when I received it the case was severely damaged any ]way.
0	Richie sounded good when I heard him on Howard, but the CD sounds overproduced and too electronic. Very disappointed and wouldn't recommend.
0	I love the original video recording, but this version adds way to much instrument background music.  Makes it difficult to hear the words at many points in the song.
0	Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
0	I reely thank this is just badily, I won't lake it becaz it is joust a bunch of dude singan about in clubbing and other stuff that blackies. I do not lake to here aboot this crape, he iz onely a musicer becaz he got shoot 9 tames. This CD doesn't like to. I don't. I thank this cd isn't soundful bat mast CDs now days a. arent. not.

Not to reccomend it is to buy me. Please do nat buy or reckomend it. Dont. Do not. No Love! Dont'!
0	This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.
0	Something my pocket purchased and played
0	Great music.  The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk.  It was very difficult to play my copy.  Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in.  This CD does not work in most of them.
0	It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend
0	Problem isn't the music. but they apparently sent us a blank.  Four different CD players and not a one can read it.  Holding it up to a strong backlight I don't see "tracks."
0	This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.
0	Love the song. Hate the download process through Amazon. I do not want your player Amazon. You made the normal download link to small, like fine print. took me too long to figure out. made me grouchy.
0	I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out .99 (big deal) but still have no song.
0	This is not the full song, it's a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration. I actually want my money back. Do not buy!
0	Purchased this and it never did show up in my account.
0	Disappointed. Nothing like their first tracks.
0	Something tells me that Nirvana could have acheived as much musicality if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical instruments.  Everybody thinks it was Korn, but it was really Nirvana who were the true founders of this "nu metal" teenage angst garbage.  You can blame Nirvana for all those annoying "mallcore" bands like Korn, Nickelback, and Linkin Park who have dominated the rock charts since the 1990s.  Almost everything bad about today's music started with Nirvana- monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, walls of distorted guitar noise, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is.  Do you Nirvana fans really believe all the hype about Nirvana "killing off hair metal" and "saving rock n roll"?  Nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things.  Nirvana were not about music.  They were about conformity and nothing more.  Just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable, immature, whiney suburban teenagers from their money.  They were the Backstreet Boys with guitars, basically.  The Linkin Park of '88-'94.  I blame Nirvana for everything bad that's happened to music in the last decade.
0	Disappointed. Poor subject matter, poor quality.
0	My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.
0	Ordered and paid for 3 song.  Only one song down loaded.  Amazon site said all 3 were down loaded.  My e-mail to them for help was never answered.  Customer service sucks!
0	I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idols, boring!
0	The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
0	Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.  To be honest I couldn't even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper. As a contrast I just bought Brandi Carlisle's Bear Creek which delivered all of this (all original) and which caught me fully first time through.  You can't go wrong with Brandi Carlisle.  Crystal Bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection.
0	SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two. That is because these songs are all over the place.  They just don't stay with any sound very long and WHY does every song also have to have long slow starts. The only positive I can think of is that this is a NEW album and that gives me hope that they'll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them. I do NOT agree with those saying this is IOWA 2.0.  This is the worst album they've ever put out in my opinion and I hope they look for a new drummer. Skip this chapter.
0	This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes. The problem here, aside the cheesiness that I personally perceived, is that the three African songs (1, 2, & 4 singed in African dialect and in French) are totally uneventful, bland, uninspiring, linear, unvaried, monotonous and TOTALLY POINTLESS!. There is NOTHING happening!. Laba Sosseh is often too busy chit-chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising, and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid-back "Tropical beach" feel with a little Electric-guitar and some trap-drums in the background which get on my nerves!.  The 1st song doesn't even offer a single chorus or a single musician's solo!. It features Laba Sosseh telling us in the middle of "a sexual fantasy" that Ngombelle is a traditional African style of dance that other countries in Africa also love to dance to, and encourages them to dance it even further!.  Song. 2 features a chorus as LONG, as ANNOYING and as INSIPID as: "in coc, in coc, in coc de ba saaah, de ba saaah, de ba saaah" ALL THE WAY THROUGH TILL THE END!. Other than that, we get Laba Sosseh inviting the people of Martinique, Curacao, Ivory Coast and Sngal to come and dance to the Coconut (whatever that means!) and to come and drink fresh Coconut juice with him on the beach! He even makes the impression he's on the phone speaking to the people of Niamey in Niger to invite them for a fresh Coconut juice too!.  (While Latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth, this is REALLY as BAD as it gets.)  For song. 4, I have nothing else to say other than a Trumpet solo by Alfredo Armenteros "Chocolate" towards the end which isn't helped by the background musicality, but which STILL comes out pretty well coming from him.  The reason why I decided to review this recording (now that it has been available under MP3 Downloads since the 5th of August 2008) is to tell you to download the GREAT 3. Maracaibo Oriental, the NICE 6. Pelta (written by Miguel Matamros) and maybe Song. 5 Anichayi which ain't gonna change your world, but which is decent enough not to be skipped (or bought for just $0.89 on MP3 Downloads.)  Even though this label was mainly run by African associates (as Pianist Alfredo Valds Jr. explained on his FASCINATING interview: "The Son of Buena Vista" in descarga's Journal Archives section [.]) I STILL think that they SHOULD have come up with a MUCH BETTER African music project that showcases the music PROPERLY, or with a classic Cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician's SPECIALITY! I would say each to their own thing!.  Therefore, the point is not to discredit African music BY ANY MEANS because it's NOT what I want to do and I DO NOT have the competences/knowledge to do it! I just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are APPALLING examples of what African music should be!  Finally, there would have been one more Laba Sosseh recording on SAR in 1982, and while I haven't heard it properly I can still tell that it's a better album than this one! There's definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isn't one track that gets near Maracaibo Oriental, overall the album does show better with a BIG hit: Diamoul Maw, 2 ROCK-SOLID Cuban tunes which also happen to be songs. 3 and 6, and apparently another hit being song. 5 Aminata. I wouldn't DARE risking recommend it to you all, but check it out anyway&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Laba-Sosseh/dp/B001ESGX6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Laba Sosseh</a>.  Song. 3 Maracaibo Oriental is literally a BRILLIANT Montno-Descrga tune! It features a BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED Piano Montno pattern by Alfredo Valds Jr. that works TO PERFECTION with this AMAZING tune TILL THE END!. There's also a SUPERB introductory Trumpet solo by Cuban GREAT Alfredo Armenteros "Chocolate", OUTSTANDING choruses by Roberto Torres and Adalberto Santiago, AMAZING 2-Trumpets/1-Trombone horn arrangements, a POWERFUL and SOLID Trombone solo by Leopoldo Pineda and some more Trumpet playing towards the end by "Chocolate" accompanying the final horn arrangements!.  EVERYTHING works TO PERFECTION on this tune and EVERYONE is REALLY "at home" and "in their own thing" here!.  [*Descrga in Latin music terms means Jam-Session.]  Song. 6 Pelta (most probably written by Miguel for his Conjnto Matamros) is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk. Otherwise, the tune is VERY PLEASANT, fairly laid back with a set of SOLID horn arrangements, a Tres-guitar solo in the middle by Victor Tras "El Chino" and some FINE Trumpet playing by "Chocolate" towards the end. The FINE chorus keeps singing throughout the tune "pelta!" [meaning jerk in Spanish slang].  Basically, a SIMPLE and GREAT tune!.  For Song. 5 (which is a decent enough Son-Montno tune), I'll let you lot take the punt.  Sound Quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine, BUT NOT BETTER than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake AGES AGO, and which I HAPPILY transferred onto a Cd through a friend JUST for those 2 songs!. My friend didn't disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long, lacked melody and were unexciting too.
0	not many good songs. a mediocre effort from a big talent
0	The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
0	Very disapointing, sounds like it is playing to slow.  Obvisouly a recording problem.
0	Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.
0	I downloaded this track by accident. This is the live version of the song. I wanted the original studio version.
0	the worst try-hard band i've ever heard - how did these turds get an album out? oh YEAH - RICH PARENTS. ugh, lovely. it sucks, don't waste your money.
0	Was hoping for a little more shred like Alien Love Secrets, or even Fire Garden. But gospel and blues type singing? . kind of a turn off. I don't think i'll blindly buy another Vai album. And that hurts to say.
0	I just don't get the hype about 50 Cent. I listened to this, and I think he is a, excuse the pun, two-bit talent.
0	There was NO CD INSIDE ONLY A PERFECTLY WRAPPED CASE! I AM LIVID!
0	just don't like it, I took it just to check it out and I found out I  don't like it.
0	I downloaded it thinking that I could use it and hear it.  It was lost in my harddrive somewhere and now I just wasted a $1.00
0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music sucks and i have none
0	Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect."
0	Three year old order this by mistake while talking to Alexa
0	I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.
0	Has anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt 1? Mr. Big Pic sounds like he is crying at the end of every line he spits. he is so emotional. it must be from the bottom of his heart
0	Would not download. Error in file name.
0	Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
0	Didn't like this version of his.  I thought I was getting the studio version with the girl back-up singers. Oh well.
0	I was under the impression it had "Amazing Grace" with a Pan Flutist  that I was looking for.  I was very disappointed that it was not!
0	When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me."
0	I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case. I will never buy anything from Kristen Overduff-Abud again!
0	What a rip off of Katy Perry. Wow! How no one has noticed is unbelievable!
0	Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!
0	Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.  I would never in a million years be able to identify this as classic Mumford & Sons - other than the fact that the lyrics are better than most bands have.  I own a few CDs that I would be absolutely heartbroken if I lost or broke, this is not going to be one of them.  It's the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but I wouldn't play it driving at night because - dare I say - it is kind of boring and yawn inducing.  I am not going to purchase new - I will wait for used and cheaper.  Not that I think Amazon is asking too much - I just don't think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollars.  Sorry Mumford & Sons, the album is OK but not what we really liked you for.
0	This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing. I will be looking into the group and if this was meant as a promo, not a bad idea. Agaion, AMAZON, a little warning next time before you just dump something on them.  You NEED to make your uploading process easier. This is getting to be too much work for too little. I may stick to iTunes
0	Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more
0	I'm giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give 5 star so this album can be on 10. You're husband should be in jail for stealing 30,000
0	That is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased.  I will find something better.  Not worth it.
0	I don't understand how this album won awards. I would ask for my money back if I could.
0	I thought I was buying the original recording from the 70's, but I bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame. Amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music. Who on earth wants to listen to fake Skynyrd?
0	Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful! Or provide info that more clearly says, recent  re- recording!
0	7 seconds of what, the hunger games intro?  Do not get this download.  You will regret it.  Need I say more.
0	I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.
0	I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store. They should not be allowed to put it up as the only album and then be like "haha it's a censored version" when they don't offer the real version at all. Now I'm stuck with a censored song that feels out of place on my iPod and I wasted a dollar. I feel intentionally misled.
0	Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!
0	I thought this was David Rosenberg i.e. Passenger.  It is NOT and wasn't worth keeping. I tossed it in the trash.  WHat a waste of $
0	I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.
0	Come on the new me is now and I not living in the past. The word of God renews my spirit daily!
0	I never ordered this. I hope it was free.
0	I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS" !  Don't be fooled!
0	What a lazy production from Pink Floyd as it's supposed last album. Very disappointed.
0	Really misleading. it's more of a 10 minute show than a full length one. Lots of behind the scenes talk but that's about it.
0	please get it off my kindle I want it off my kindle I can not stress this enough those of us with ocd are freaking out with all the clutter we can not get rid of.
0	Sorry@ The Head and the Heart but I just don't get it. I would love to buy every one of your albums but this just it's worth the money.
0	Pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blues bar to hear her live but on a CD with generic musicians - not so much . so decent voice but weak backing musicians on a CD. Forgettable.
0	The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.
0	not my kind of music, downloaded them for a funeral
0	very old school, but was looking for the song for a frend
0	I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup. I don't think I should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is 1/10 of the original data in mp3 format. I would gladly pay an extra $5 dollars or whatever for wav handling, I don't think this is too much to ask. Amazon or Itunes can't seem to comprehend this.
0	I would recommend finding a different version to download.  I absolutely love this song, it has good sound quality, BUT they cut off the entire last word/note!  It drives me crazy and really ruins the track.
0	It sounded good on the clips. After I bought it though and listened to it all the way through I just wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be.
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement.  Always disappointing.  Be forewarned.  It was revealed in very small print.
0	Art Garfunkel? His version was much better, more relaxed, and much smoother. I get the feeling this one was a little out of Mr. Groban's range.
0	From[.], dated August 17, 2008:  The compilation album "A closer end", that recently started appearing on the P2P networks as well as on Ebay and in certain record stores, is NOT an official Dark tranquillity album but a bootleg. It's very convincingly made, with a Century media logo, fake barcode and extensive booklet, but it's nevertheless a bootleg.  It's usually a better strategy to be silent about these things, but as a lot of people keep mailing us asking whether "A closer end" is a genuine album or not, and since the CD has started to appear on online discographies, presented as a legitimate release, we feel the need to set the record straight.
0	From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.  Nothing at all to sink your teeth into.  Was this a contractual obligation album?  Resting on their laurels?  It will sell because of who we are!  Guys, please don't end your musical career as a band with this one!
0	I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't. It's a solo album by BOC's drummer, Albert Bouchard, and seems to be an attempt at a "rock opera". Despite the efforts of musicians such as Joe Satriani and Robbie Krieger, the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another. The rather pointless re-do of "Astronomy" seems to indicate that there wasn't enough material to work with. And if you're going to call this a BOC album, you've gotta have Buck Dharma, who gets short shrift here. The word is that the record company insisted that IMAGINOS be released as a Blue Oyster Cult album, apparently realizing that this material wasn't going to be too saleable on its own. The album is not a total disaster (I kind of like the Baron Frankenstein number), but I'm very glad that I didn't pay $100.00 for it on eBay! I would have been much happier with a reissue of BOC's CLUB NINJA, and hope to see that happen sometime soon. (PS 07/27/08: CLUB NINJA is coming soon!)
0	The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.
0	I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
0	CD case arrived cracked in many places. Have yet to open the case because it is a gift, but hopefully it is ok.
0	quality of recording is not perfect?*%

0	i downloaded this song because it was free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest, and immediately went and bought the album.  i was disappointed, only enjoyed a few songs.  the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping.  don't waste your time and money
0	This is terrible. Anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever. Its so overplayed & way overrated.
0	Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience. It is highly recommended that one doesn't expose themselves to this music voluntarily though. To do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one's world view in small, and the world at large. Anyone who likes this doesn't like music, but I wouldn't know, I don't like music either-I like MOGWAI-Good boys from Glasgow Scotland that know how to rock. For "If it dunnae rock 'tis piss"
0	Ok CD.  A few good songs but not worth the buy.  Obviously there is better bands out there but if you want "rock" music you can listen to with your pop friends, this will work
0	Product sucked got it and it skips very badly to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it was just as bad and warped very bad.
0	can't determine if music downloaded, can't find where it downloaded or to what file. won't download from amazon music again, due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	Susan has such a wonderful voice I could not wait to receive this CD.  What a waste of money.  Could these songs be sung any slower?  Very disapointed. L
0	I was very excited to purchase this CD only to get it home and find out how awful it was! Maybe I will grow to like it better if I can stomach to listen to it again. I have been a huge fan of Josh Groban's for years! I feel ripped off and so disappointed!
0	Bought by mistake.  Not among Kelly's best (check out Ne-Yo's song of the same name).
0	terrible terrible terrible terribleit wasn't the original artists it was a big scam it was a remake by some artist I never heard of
0	I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
0	Its a live version and the song doesn't start until around a minute in. Not good to work out to.
0	i like the cd or better said, Prince's music. my problem is the packaging is crap. i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out. the cd snapped like a potato chip. seriously. product quality means everything, not just the music.
0	Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(
0	Did not download as expected, emailed amazon, no answer!
0	Terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer Leslie Rasmussen blames a rape victim
0	Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.  end note: At least he still looks good though. I hope his next single is more original and heartfelt, and less clich and boring. This one sounds like he was so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic.
0	I love him, not as much as he does, but I have enjoyed all his music to this point. You can find songs like this on any album in the genre, nothing was added to the music world from this album.
0	Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
0	CD wasn't what i thought it was. Wasn't the seller's fault.
0	. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.
0	If I was having myself a bowel movement at a b-bq joint in Anytown, USA and this came on mid movement, i'd committ Hari Kari. it's that terrible. this makes Shania Twain sound like Mozart.
0	I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection. I don't know why Iron Maiden decided to release their albums on picture disc since Brave New World they don't sound as good as normal black or colored vinyl. Too much surface noise and ticks and pops. Please, if someone involved in this is reading this review I beg you stop releasing Iron Maiden albums on picture disc and get better sound engineers to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl.
0	The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Only In America: Atlantic Soul Classics</a>).  This marvelous collection includes the ORIGINAL recordings of great Drifters songs, as well as many other Atlantic performers such as Ben E. King, Don Covay, Sam & Dave and Otis Redding.  It ain't cheap, but the real thing seldom is.
0	Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.
0	I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
0	Like the other reviews of this 'gift' ,  the question is why. Why was this even recorded and released, that's just for starters.
0	If yo listen to the lyrics, terrible!  nice, pop melody though which is probably why it's so popular.
0	As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.
0	I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
0	Did not like the song at all. I remove it from my download. very disappointed in the way it is song and the music.
0	I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.
0	Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.
0	I have trouble keeping this CD on.  The singing is dreadful. Her voice is horrible.  It sounds like she is calling the devil.  My kids leave when it is on.  I can not recommend this CD, it's just not good.
0	I paid for this song so I could attach it to some pictures of my daughter. it wouldn't play the whole thing. I definitely felt ripped off
0	I accidentally bought it. I hate it. I think you have to have a military background to enjoy it. It's certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor.
0	The version of the song is not my favorite. Unfortunately, I think this is the only version released. I even tried to find the song on the soundtracks of the National Lampoon Vacation movies but wasn't able.
0	I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.
0	I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
0	I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.  How could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once. The first time is enough torture, seriously!  The lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese has really put one over on the music industry and the public was sold a bill of rotting goods! It's like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyrics with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something  quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up.  I like Ne-yo but his singing leaves a lot to be desired. This song sucks badly! I think the other reviewers must be victims of and over saturation of no talent acts in this modern day music business because there is no way in h_ll this crap could be called music. Many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isn't it!
0	His vocals are too modern country. The songs are depressing and mundane. They are all too similar. It just goes on for too long.
0	I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
0	I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.
0	I can't rate this!  It did not open for me. I am unable to open or hear this song. How can I make it open in MP3 form?  HELP
0	Love the song but this version is barely audible. Hello, it's ROCK, where's the volume.
0	Not even enough here to rate! It cuts out and off before you can distinguish anything on it. Don't like it.
0	I did not like it because I was looking for LP not single. Anyways, I sent it back and I was quickly processed for money return. It was needing more information on the add.
0	If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
1	Beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through.
1	My students ad I love this song and the video that made us go and buy it. It's upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone!
1	Fabulous music, love the violin and the piano in the background. The music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me. One of the best CD's ever!
1	With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry. Lifehouse has not let down with "Stanley Climbfall".  I strongly recommend it.
1	Lady Gaga - cheers to you darling, this song is FABULOUS! I HIGHLY recommend you buy it. I did and I will never regret it. This is a song you can listen to over and over again. Wonderful! :)
1	I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.
1	A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.
1	Fantastic voice that jives well with the retro sound. Like a dark, smokey Pink Martini. I don't have five more words.
1	Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.
1	I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning. I would definitely recommend this album. Get the whole thing. It rules. And, BTW, I am becoming a very big Tron fan, thanks to this awesome CD! And I watched the first Tron, and I really really enjoyed that one. I think everyone needs to watch that one if they've seen, or are going to see, the second one, because it really helps to understand it all. Thank you all you Tron people!
1	Dark, but great song. And its easy to play on an acoustic guitar. liked it, good value for the price and convienient to download. I love amazon.
1	Even Switchfoot's "B-Sides" are amazing! Any fan would love this EP
1	This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.
1	Heard the song on the radio the other day had to download the song. Brought back memories when I was younger.
1	-Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar
1	This is great sound and Pink is good in everything that she sings. If you love this like I do get all of her music.
1	This is my favorite version of Valerie : it has personality, class, great performing style. oh, it is beautiful.  I realy wish that it would be her signature song, not the " I'm not going to rehab, (no, no, no,) " one.
1	This Soundtrack is one of my favorite albums ever. The movie is great, and so is the Soundtrack. Kevin Spacey does a great job all around!
1	You can't help but tear up when listening to this song. It's an amazing song amd Lea made it even better!
1	I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.
1	Thank you so much, it's fantastic, I truly appreciate it, very very peaceful! It's amazing the way it makes you feel!
1	OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!
1	More Jimi Hendrix awesomeness! Do I really need to say anything? If your a Jimi fan, buy it and listen!
1	And lyrics that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyrics of Belfast, Bernie Taupin sure can paint a picture wit words.  Can't wait for the album.
1	Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
1	This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.  Fassbaender's singing style (if you want to call it "singing") includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato.  This bizarre, exaggerated vibrato causes Fassbaender's "singing" to be grossly distorted, to be a perversion, and to be an insult to the Mahlerian tradition.  When Fassbaender's voice has a prominent role in any recording, it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed, irritated, and angry.  In some kinds of music, such as I PUT A SPELL ON YOU as recorded by SCREAMING JAY HAWKINS, or in grindcore music, such as EXHUME TO CONSUME as recorded by the grindcore band CARCASS, the distorted voice is the point of the recording, and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience.  But Fassbaender fails to realize that Mahler's music is not grindcore music.  Also, Fassbaender fails to realize that Mahler's music is not some type of "novelty song" as is the case with I PUT A SPELL ON YOU.  For this reason, I recommend only Das Klagende Lied, but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this 2-disc set.  The compositions on the disc are all by Gustav Mahler, and they consist of Das Klagende Lied, Kindertotenlieder, Des Knaben Wunderhorn, Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen (all four songs of Songs of a Wayfarer are here), and Ruckert Leider (all five songs are here). Only three of the thirteen of the songs of Des Knaben Wunderhorn are on this compilation.  This review provides a side-by-side comparison of Des Knaben Wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of Simon Rattle. The Rattle recording is slightly better, for reasons disclosed below. This review also provides a side-by-side comparison of one of the songs from Das Knaben Wunderhorn (the song about the fish) with the recording by Thomas Qusthoff and the Beliner Philharmoniker under the baton of Claudio Abbado. The Abbado recording is slightly better, for the reasons listed below.  SECOND-BY-SECOND ACCOUNT OF WALDMARCHEN. This provides a description of the opening moments of DAS KLAGENDE LIED, one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire. WALDMARCHEN begins with muffled kettle drums. At the 6 second point, the French horns provide a short riff. Then, at 18 seconds, the flutes join in. The French horns resume at 23 seconds, and at 24 seconds, the reeds and strings join the fray. At 33 seconds, the French horns join in again, and here they play a real tune, not just a riff. At 50 seconds, the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch, and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch. At one minute and 37 seconds comes a momentary crescendo. It is a big crescendo, but there is not any crash of cymbals. These timings are for the Rattle recording. This and other parts of DAS KLAGENDE LIED are essentially the same for the Chailly recording and for the Rattle recording, with the nit-picky exceptions that I list below. The Chailly recording of Waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second, but the Rattle recording starts with music, not with any hum.  COMPARING WALDMARCHEN RECORDINGS UNDER THE BATON OF CHAILLY AND RATTLE. The Chailly timing is 28 minutes and 8 seconds, while the Rattle timing is 28 minutes and 31 seconds. In the Chailly recording, the tenor (Werner Hollweg) makes his entrance at 5 min, 36 sec, singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire. Mr. Hollweg's voice is slightly tinny. In the Rattle recording, the tenor (Robert Tear) makes his entrance at 5 min, 23 seconds. Robert Tear's voice is somewhat creamy sounding, somewhat like that of Thomas Quasthoff. Thus, I have a very slight preference for the Rattle recording. For reasons unknown to me, the Chailly recording has a tenor (Werner Hollweg) and a bass (Andreas Schmidt), while in contrast, the Rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone. The tenor is Robert Tear and the baritone is Sean Rea.  The next movement in Das Klagende Lied is DER SPEILMANN. There is no discernable difference to my ears, in the opening minutes of the Chailly and Rattle recordings.  HOCHZEITSSTUCK. The Chailly recording clocks at 18:32, while the Rattle recording is 18:57. The opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums, a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses, and blaring brass. This third movement of Das Klagende Lied is distinguished by the presence of an off-stage band, which is much quieter than the on-stage orchestra. The off-stage band can be heard, for example, in the interval of 2:16 to 3:12. When the off-stage band is playing, the only other source of music is vocal soloists, at least for this interval of time. This movement also features a chorus  PREFERENCES. For the following reasons, I have a slight preference for the Rattle recording of Das Klagende Lied. The Rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume, and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic. In contrast, the Chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy. Also I have a slight preference for Robert Tear's voice, over the tinny voice of Hollweg.  The following compares DAS KNABEN WUNDERHORN from the Chailly recording with that by Thomas Quasthoff (baritone) and Anne Sofie von Otter (mezzosoprano), as conducted by Abbado on the Deutche Grammophon label. On the Chailly recording, there are only three songs, as I mentioned above, and these are sung by Brigitte Fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato. In the Abbado recording, some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female. My favorite of all of the songs from DAS KNABEN WUNDERHORN is the song about the fish, and I like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in Mahler's Symphony No. 2. Anyway, this compares the fish song (DES ANTONIUS VON PADUA FISHPREDIGHT from the Chailly and Abbado recordings. Notable features of the Abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at 20-30 seconds and 60-65 seconds, and the five second donkey-like braying from clarinets that occurs at 60 seconds and again at 105 seconds. The piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding Chinese gong. I prefer the Abbado recording over the Chailly recording for many reasons. First of all, the Chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo. Also, in the Chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured, because Brigitte Fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes, and because Brigitte Fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato. The clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the Chailly recording. Also, the very end of the piece in the Chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon, and to my ears, the mysterious sounding Chinese gong does not occur at the end of the Chailly recording. To reiterate these points, what I like and prefer about the Abbado recording is the crisper sound, and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes, donkey braying, and mysterious Chinese gong.  CONCLUSION. The Chailly recording provides a great selection of Mahler's pieces that are not numbered symphonies. A careful side-by-side comparison of any of the pieces on the Chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording. I did my own side-by-side comparisons, and discovered that I had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of Simon Rattle and Claudio Abbado. Das Klagende Lied is my very favorite of Mahler's compositions, and it has been my favorite since the year 1972. It was composed when Mahler was only twenty years old.
1	Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!
1	I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.
1	Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!
1	My kid loves this song! It is so much fun to listen to and sing along with. Bonus, I don't get tired of hearing it.
1	Awesome CD. Listen all the way through.
1	The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.
1	This song was just as I remembered it from my teen years.  I really enjoyed listening to it. more than once.
1	From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties. Check the song out, and you might find you like it if you're into post-hardcore, modern rock, or you're just looking for a song to turn up the heat. Who knew a Lil' Wayne song could turn into something pretty decent?  Oh, by the way, I don't think the music video will be coming to an MTV near you anytime soon. ;)
1	There is just something about Brett Eldredge's tone. I just love to listen to him sing
1	I didn't like it at first. After listening to it a few times, I got it. It's beautiful. Lanny is a musical genius.
1	Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone. Natalie has had a lot of great songs that she recorded when she came back after personal vices and bankruptcy in the 80's, that nearly derailed her career and her life. In the 90's, she made peace with the passing of her beloved father, Nat King Cole, and went into Jazz music, after years of R&B. But she had some great songs for everyone alone. A Smile Like Yours is one of those songs that is worth listening to from beginning to end. She flexed her sweet, and beautiful voice in the movie track, with the same title name from 1997. It is a lovely song, and I think of this song from Natalie, as one of her best in her lifetime. It ranks just as high as songs like Miss You Like Crazy and Everlasting Love. I miss Natalie so much, but I am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice, with a deep heart.  Natalie Cole:  1950-2015  Song: B+
1	This is a favorite tune. Thanks for the quick delivery to my Kindle. I have enjoyed the tune many times and am still enjoying playing it.
1	Prince was ahead of his time on this one. My grandchildren like it and the older ones understand it too.
1	Louie Prima and Keely Smith, the kings and queen of the 50's 'Vegas lounge circuit. Included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in "Just One Of Those Things".
1	best cd i bought in a year. I play it constantly when I do art and it is so soothing.
1	THIS IS A GOOD SONG DON'T WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL SURE THE ALBUM IS GOOD
1	Purchased for my 7-year-old niece's MP3 player this past Christmas.  Clear download, nice song, decent price, no problems completing transaction.
1	This is by far the best Cd MJ has produced
1	This is a very good sounding MP3 download and you will be happy with the sound and quality of this download
1	Wonderful old song - not covered enough at all.
1	I bought this CD some years ago and I was most interested in a recording of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony played on period instruments. Undoubtedly, Sir Roger Norrington's interpretation of this work is very good and I think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra, The London Classical Players, are a highlight of this recording.  The music is played with precision, a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically.  What really impressed me with this performance was Norrington's winning and joyful interpretation of the 5th Symphony, which I knew only superficially before I bought this recording. Norrington sometimes works miracles with lesser known or less popular works - his interpretations of Beethoven's 2nd and 8th symphonies are, in some ways, his best in his Beethoven symphonic cycle.  I listened to the 5th yesterday, when I was feeling very low, and it put me in a much better frame of mind. We all need music like this sometimes. I've needed it a lot lately.  Sir Roger Norrington's recordings of the symphonies of Schubert and Schumann with The London Classical Players are all splendid and worth having. I find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composers played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they really aren't getting close to this music or even "getting it". Modern orchestras make this music sound so ponderous, heavy and stodgy.  A recording for people who like fresh, crisp Summer salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, washed down with chilled chardonnay, and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat, stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table!
1	it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim. The music complements the song as well.
1	very good centering music to maintain balance.
1	Excellent sound quality and music selections of the great Sousa! A must buy for any march lover!
1	I like this song there is not a lot I can say other than I like it and so do my friends
1	INCREDIBLE MUSICAL TALENT AND SO INSPIRATIONAL!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
1	I purchased this song because it was one of the songs my father requested be played at his funeral. And Rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion.
1	Exactly what I was hoping for! Heard the title song, You+Me, and love that sound. Lucky for me all the songs sound just as good. Listen to it everyday.
1	Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.
1	This band is so good!  There last album was good.  This one is even better!
1	This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.
1	Wonderful music, as always by Josh Groban.
1	A mellow, infectious, romantic love song, Not only for the female species, but most definitely for guys who are truly in love.
1	Great Voice!  This is a wonderful album to listen to.  Well worth the $5
1	I have never been a huge Death Cab fan, but I love this new song.  Its modern, clean, and just a great song.  If this is any indication of what to expect from their new album, I think its going to be great.
1	There were a couple of top 40 songs from this album, but the entire collection is solid and has a unique sound.
1	Love this song!  Can picture the scene as it plays out.  A favorite every time I hear it!  Thank you!
1	Awesome song and it's a timeless classic. I dare you through this on at the gym for the beach body pump
1	I thought their first album was amazing and this may even be better. The lyrics, vocals, instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time I listen.
1	I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone. Storyline: a girl ends up going to her only living relative after her parents were killed in an accident. The relative is an older aunt, an anthropologist, living in the outback. She shares a story with her niece. So the story within the story is the creation of the earth: "When the earth was ready to be born [ancient Ancestors] stretched and yawned. and began to roam the planet. As they did, they sang, and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence." When they were done, there was a lone melody who wondered what she was and she's told to harmonize "with earth, sun and moon and stars" to find out what she really is. The story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody, and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of Australia.
1	I love Bronn Journey harp music.  Thanks.
1	My 14 months old baby loves this song. Quality is great. I wanted exactly same sinsong, singed by same singer etc. and I think this is it!
1	Beautifully written and sung. A song to listen to over and over. Sound quality is good especially with headphones, oh yeahhhh.
1	This is one of my wife's favorite Tanya Tucker songs. I just had to get it for her.
1	Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.
1	a very simple and bit plain country Album that anyone would enjoy.
1	You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.  Because there are no extremes of dynamics, I think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car, where extreme softs and louds are problematic.  (Modern equipment can do "compression", which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars, so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration.)  Bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies, but it holds up beautifully.  I recommend it, and the entire set.
1	I friend recommended this music to me and I fell in love. I love the honest, open worship. IF you enjoy Bethel type worship, then you will love Worshipmob. I can't wait for another CD by them.
1	Great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in your favorite crusier. Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the music.
1	Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!
1	I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

1	Heard this song on the radio a few times and loved it. When I finally found out the name, I bought. It's cute and catchy, preview it and see (hear) for yourself =)
1	I'm touched by the depth of Plumb's songs.  It really resonates with the pain I'm current healing from.  Thank you, Plumb.
1	Always a classic song.  Great quality, too.
1	THIS IS A GREAT SOUNDING SET WHICH IS VERY RELAXING TO LISTEN TO.  I RECOMEND IT HIGHLY ALTHOUGH I DO NOT  RECOMEND THE SECOND SET "100 MORE PIANO MASTERPIECES".
1	Great Album - Can't wait to hear more from this group!
1	I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.g. "I must find some kind persona grata, to give me data, personally").  For that reason, I think I prefer Rosemary Clooney's recording of the song.
1	My wedding song thirty-two years ago
1	This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry. It's a song written from the perspective of Jesus to his friend Lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of Jesus over death.  A few other highlight for me include "Shame," "Right Wrong Girl," and "Dare I Say." Truthfully, I enjoy all the songs on this record and I'm thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like Peter Furler is still putting out quality music. It's a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on Christian radio.
1	The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls !
1	One of the most beautiful songs ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singers.
1	Another big Streisand Winner Album. great collaboration duos.
1	Average White Band was and is music to Iisten to.  1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to.
1	Great song.  I had no idea she was Rob Shneider's daughter!
1	I love how they incorporated holiday bells into this soon-to-be Christmas classic!  Well done, P-Unit!
1	He is a young george straight. Nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music. I hope he has a great career.
1	. but not the people that sold it to me. It was meant to be saved as an investment but when I got it it was scratched in the front. Very disappointed. :(
1	This is an absolute classic. It brings me back to the day when michael was but a wee child prodigy and that make sme happy
1	I lost this song from my mp3 album. I noticed it was missing and this was not acceptable to me. This was my first downloaded song from Amazon a few years ago.
1	This is one of the greatest tunes of the year, if not - ever. However, I ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it, but it dosent, so now I get to buy another copy of this cd.
1	Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas  Sister Hazel Love this song.  Made Christmas a wonderful time for all of us.
1	I bought  this CD when it it first came out and still  listen to it every week. Deftones  is one of my favorite  bands.
1	Have 3 of their CDs and love all three. Love how they bring some old songs back to new life God is Great!
1	Great song, long length. Thought provoking. Brings back good memories from the 90s. You'll ask yourself. where was I when I heard that?
1	Love the work wish the CD had more Tracks!
1	Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.  You round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before. such is the power of Attunement.  This CD demands careful listening and will ultimately prove to be Demby's masterpiece of spontaneous composition (spontaneous combustion?. it does smoke at times. the fire from the earth's inner core) A stunning CD that deserves the widest possible exposure!
1	This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.  Kris L. CocKayne
1	Dr. Octagon paramedic fetus of the East with priests, I'm from the Church of the Operating Room. With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse. Holding up office lights standing at huge heights. Back and forth, left wing, swing to North, East and South with blood pouring down your mouth. I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope, listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP! Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap. Look at the land. Blue Flowers! Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers! Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue Flowers! Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow. Would you care to listen to me more? Thank you! Holding bags on down right from the hospital, it's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf.

1	This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.
1	Hope to hear more of him publicly! Has a great voice and knows how to sing those country songs! Keep up the good work
1	Some of my favorite music from back in the 80s . brings back so many wonderful memories! The CD arrived in perfect condition!
1	This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.
1	The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track. People - BUY THIS ALBUM. Let's put cher at Number 1 again where she belongs!
1	The stars say it all, don't know what else I could put other than I love it.
1	Grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled times it's no suprise. But she finally catches on that there is God who is flow of enduring love. The theme song deputies this in a haunting way.
1	You can "B. Sure" that this tune is still great! Get it now! It will bring back old memories, and sound all new at the same time.
1	One of my favorite Dylan albums. A masterpiece!
1	This is a great song with a great message.  Yolanda Adams is one of the best gospel/inspirational singers ever.  King Kong ain't got nothing one her!  (Lol)
1	Sounds like old school Veruca Salt.  Recommended.
1	Louisville represent. Love supporting artists from my home state. Laid back soul. You gotta listen to this.
1	Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.
1	At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.  So if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a CD of your chosing that expresses your love for her.
1	that voice,this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe. love is grand, so appreciate it. because everything fades away.
1	I do suggest on getting it if you're into sleepy time music. that's what I consider this. along with the Postal Service, music to fall asleep to.
1	Jackie's voice has really matured. As other reviewers have said and I agree with, "this is hauntingly beautiful". This being the first single from her new album, I really can't wait to hear the other songs from the album.
1	I like listening to Demi Lavato's music.  She is pretty good.  I bought it for my Kindle Fire HD.  You should like it too.
1	This is a good track from my teen years.  It always makes me happy when I rediscover a song from my childhood.  I have not heard any of their other music, but this is a good track to get ;)
1	Has a lot of memories was popular when I met my husband of 52 years. What more could I say except I am looking forward to summer.
1	Awesome value! This is a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is perfect for having on in the background of a Christmas party. For $.99 there's no better value.
1	Love the song it's so uplifting and I play it three or four times a day just to get moving!
1	Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.  (Thanks, Pooh for the great word, smackerl, you silly ole bear).  Yet, although I am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular-bands-of-yore-oh-so-great in FireFlight's unique sound - I must state these 'ingredients' are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh - and dare I say anointed? Check out the band's website - [.]. They have their videos available for your viewing pleasure.  There's a genuine story being told in each song - I assure you.
1	I love the song  White Christmas.  Michael and Shania make a very good duet couple.  Very good Christmas song for anyone.
1	Love this song. Start my day out with it.
1	I saw Ruben win on American Idol, loves his singing.
1	I love this song! Nick's voice is so hot! It is always my ringtone around Valentine's Day! I do wish him and Jess were still together but I still love it!
1	I LOVE this album! A very anointed project!
1	Jojo's voice is truly gifted! She has comeback with great force and can't wait for further music from her in the future! This tringle is great!
1	This is "Our Song" for my boyfriend and me. means a lot!
1	This song is awesome. I'm not a huge fan of Three Days Grace, but this is by far my favorite.
1	Love this song, reminiscent of Grover Washington Jr. Great style and warmth.
1	was looking for this song for a long time and didn't want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didn't want.
1	This is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. Really takes me back to that time, really good song.
1	This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.
1	love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff! love it! Good good stuff! :)
1	I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.
1	There's just something about him that takes me away. he's got this voice that is so unique that talks to your soul.
1	This is Terry Fator.  What more can you ask for?  A must have for the real die hard Terry Fator fan.
1	What's there NOT to like with Billy Currington. I excercise to Must of Done SOmething Right. easy slow so start with stretching then upper body movements. I have arthritis. so this is great for me.
1	I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.  Tac has stated:  ". it's a snapshot of our generation right now.  The way a lot of us feel in a time of war, technology, pain and love.  It's easy to feel dissociated and NUMB to all the chaos we call life today."  I have felt this way, but I haven't articulated it, even to myself.  ABiCA's lyrics reflect this state of affairs, and musically they draw on various influences. The main ones I notice are Linkin Park, Hollywood Undead and of course, Eminem.  The lyrics cover the whole range of problems - political, personal and social. The title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album: "If everything that mattered to me is now gone. Now take a closer look and tell me what you see."  Track 2, "Tell Us Why", continues with the directly political: "We are underground. Before you say goodbye, you've got to tell us why."  Things get more personal in "Turn Me On", which seems to be about people questioning one's route to self-satisfaction.  In "My Song" and "The Things You Think I Say", the anguish is over failed relationships.  "The Pursuit" has the lines "Just let me in. If I get the chance to play, I think you'll want me to stay."  "Beautiful" has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times:  "You're beautiful, so {CENSORED} beautiful. I'd be a little more complete if I just had you."  "Just Another", "Never That Far Away" and "Nothing Here" are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense, demanding and hypocritical.  As for musical influences, there are elements other than the ones I mentioned above which are noticeable. Three of the tracks open with melodic, solemn piano, which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious.  "I Can Be Real" and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of, say, Nine-Inch Nails.  "Gave 'Em A Reason" opens with dance music elements, then includes some excellent guitar work, both grungy and psychedelic - a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic, spiritual, up, and grunge is depressing, scary, down.  Several tracks have a synth-string background that gives them a more mainstream sound.  "Just Another" includes military-style drumming and Army-march lingo.  Release from numbness comes in the final track "What You See", with an ironic twist.  They sing, "Open up your eyes. Nothing more to hide. now the time has come/And all this goes away, and I'm not {CENSORED} NUMB. Look around, NOTHING EVER HEALS THE PAIN." The irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them.  It could almost be an 80's pop-rock track, and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting.  Hmmmm.  The album is full of explicit language (which I had to censor in this review), so if you are one of those people who can't take that, by all means stay away.  But if you are OK with free expression, you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while.
1	For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.  From the up tempo "Girls Ride Horses Too" to the memory laced  "Until I Met You", these two songs are just a few of the hard to find gems on any CD of any type.  I was absolutely estatic to find the Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet song "You can't Stop Love" in this collection.  This is a song that I have searched for on CD for 3 years. This CD also has rarities from "The Girls Next Door (Slow Boat to China), "Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt (Baby's got a new baby)", and two Becky Hobbs selections (Jones on the Jukebox, They always look better when they're leavin').  If you are searching for these obscure recordings on CD, this offering will not disappoint you.
1	I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.
1	Very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome.
1	This is so sweet.  Frank Fotusky music is as relaxing as a front porch on a Saturday afternoon, but listening carefully, and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for Saturday night.  Frank plays and sings Piedmont Style blues in the style of Gary Davis, Blind Boy Fuller and John Jackson.  This guitar-as -piano style, in which he keeps an active bass while picking melody notes, is a rich sound, one at which Frank is very much in control.  From the first note of Red River to the last chord of Great Change, Frank breathes his own soul into his covers and presents original tunes like Mumbletypeg and Franklyn Mint.  The tone he coaxes out of his Gibson jumbo is exquisite.  Highly recommended.
1	Classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation. Check JDilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion.
1	Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.
1	Timeless lyrics and music for anyone who has Loved and Lost. basically, all of us just about.
1	I love this song! I also like This Girl is On Fire! I love her! I look forward to her next album!
1	This is great and interesting music. This is music that is both creative as well as being entertaining. I look forward to listening to future music contributions.
1	used this for my uncle's funeral and the download did the job it was used for.  Not much to say about a music mp3
1	An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.] . add them and tell them "alex from nc" sent you!
1	I love her music, it's great to listen to. She is one of the great singers in the world right now. I love playing her songs.
1	Great songs better than season one that also deserve a full CD release like season 1
1	Billy Joel is not one of my favorite musicians but his music on this album was a steal at the sale price I got on it.
1	This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!
1	Classic Al stuff. In his usual humorous style. Early in Al's albums every song is great.
1	Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.
1	love this song. Nate is a great praise and worship singer.
1	WELL IT'S WRECKX-N-EFFECT. WHAT MORE NEED'S TO BE SAID. MR TEDDY RILEY DID IT YET AGAIN. WITH THIS GROUP MADE UP OF HIS BROTHER & COUSIN HE KILLED THE 90'S
1	I love this song! Download was smooth and simple.  Burn to disc was fine.  Will download more music from Amazon.
1	Loving the new sound the boys are bringing to this new album so far! Cannot wait to hear the rest of their album. The boys are awesome and so talented!
1	I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.  Hope this helps
1	I think that 50 cents newest cd get rich or die tryin is great. He is the hottest thing on the street right now.  Everyone is bumppin 50.  Get rich or die tryin got alot of cameos and it sounds great its better than Ja Rule! haha
1	Classic Redman.  Glad to see him back
1	This piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of "The Great Mass". This portion is so moving, I can  listen to it over and over.
1	Billy Currington's album is great. It is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Billy is going to become one of the top artists in the next few years. Every one should buy this album!
1	Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".
1	Great song! Band has a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good as well! Recommend to people who like heavy metal, just not cookie monster metal!
1	When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle." Though the track sounds a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial (and maybe it got used that way at some point), it's actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it's sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music.  I hear there actually was a dance called "The Shuffle" that accompanied this song, but I don't have any knowledge of how the steps go. If you do, perhaps you'll clue us in!
1	this was a well received gift. Can't go wrong with John Lennon anything.
