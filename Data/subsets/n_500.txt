1	They must have found these old recordings outtakes someone made with a $35 casette recorder and decided to make some money. The sound quality is horrible and the singing is off key. It sounds like someone recorded it over the phone. There isn't one redeeming thing about this CD. Complete waste of money.
1	I got this for a friend so I didn't listen to it and not my kind of music.
1	I don't -hate- Lady Gaga, but this song is just awful. I heard it in Las Vegas while looking at the CSI gift shop, and my reaction was wanting to puke. "light me up, put me on top, let's falalalalalalalala"?! What are you 13 years old.  Cherry cherry bomb bomb.
1	Chordiac Arrest was a great experience in person. They were hilarious, and sang well. Unfortunately, little of this recording captures that live experience. There are funny bits that do come across, but others are hard to hear because the audio levels are inconsistent. And at times the audience is laughing uproariously at the action onstage while the listener doesn't have a clue what's going on. You're better off getting the DVD or checking them out on YouTube
1	Wow.  I thought the other reviewers were just being picky, so I gave a listen.  This is some seriously bad music.  Free isn't good enough - you'd have to pay me to download this.  You'd have to pay me a lot.  How about some good free samples?
1	Can't play on american DVD players very DISSAPOINTED.  Sent it back.  When we AMERICANS can play mrs brown let us know.  Thanks
1	Yikes, who knew the celts were such big fans of synthesizers! This Christmas enjoy all the soul-less expression of elevator music without the elevator. Oh, and remember, it's free so you have to like it.
1	Just receive the import two ago and though the song is great I was hoping to listen to more remixes of Stamp your feet than just one.  Usually an cd  single has at least 5 remixes of a song on it.  I have the album caryons  and have the album version already why put it on again  with a remix that is a few seconds longer than the orgional?  This cd signle is a rip off!!
1	nirvana's music is depressing and drab.  i like the to enjoy some depression in the form of radiohead, for example.  but this cd is really crap, i just don't get the hype.  i assume the media glommed onto it, said it was something new and different, and thus the hype began, shaping american music pop culture for a few years.  it is funny to me that every time you read a review of this album it speaks of shaping the music of the 90's (in america), thus elevating it to must-have status.  first of all, a trend is a trend.  soundgarden and pearl jam were much better than nirvana.  but if i had to rank pop trends, grunge ranks extremely low on my list.  nirvana and its ilk could never have happened and we would be quite happy.  shaping a few years of music does not make a record great; influential, yes; great, no.  this is not a great album, and it sparked a rather bland and uncreative period for pop music.  glad it's gone.  now let me hear some led zeppelin or black sabbath (the real grunge, in my opinion), and i'll be much happier.
1	not as good as his other cd
1	Noise is not music. She can't sick a lick and no musical training to speak of. This cd sounds like a train wreck ...only not so lyrical.
1	I gave this song one star because the previous time it was 5 plus 1 now 6 STARS! SIA is great! Her voice one of a kind!
1	I received a free MP3 download from Amazon as a reward for previous purchases. Love this song...love Corrine. Thanks! However, I can't listen to it unless I subscribe to the Cloud. No thanks! I forgot for a moment that there's no such thing as a free lunch.
1	I bought this album for my sweet, devout christian grandmother. The moment this album began to play my sweet grandmother went into a fit of rage. She ran to the kitchen ands started throwing all of the China dishes out the window. One by one they flew out of her 2nd story apartment window. Sadly, the gravy boat hit a passer-by right square I'm the noggin and gave him a concussion. I ran downstairs to help, but it was too late.  The moral of this story. Save lives, don't buy this album. I think there is a subliminal message playing behind the music that is turning the elderly into crazed lunatics.
1	Their last CD was amazing with such great songs like Starless, Cold, Dead Skin, etc. This one sounds like the least common denominator of rock. Absolute drivel. I can barely believe that this is the same band. The difference is night and day between this album and the last one.  THere wasn't even one song thatI think is even worth buying. Glad I listened to this online instead of just buying it based on past history.  Even the supposed single is terrible. What a shame.
1	My 2 Star rating is for the ITEM and not for the MUSIC.  The music rates 10+ Stars.  Billie Holiday literally made hundreds of recordings in her career, between 1935 and 1959.  To call this item "The COMPLETE Billie Holiday" is misleading to her newer and more casual fans, who might come across this and think she only made 35 tracks in her life.  Amazon, please change this before you confuse a lot of people.  You could call this "The Best of Billie Holiday" but that would be a very subjective selection, as Ms. Holiday's style changed quite a bit from label to label and even from album to album, and such a list would depend on what period or style of her music most interests you.  These selections are entirely from her OKEH and VOCALION (Columbia) Sessions.  While these are arguably her finest recordings, there are those fans who prefer her Verve, Commodore, and yes, even the Decca sides.  These labels, among others, are not represented here.  What's next?  The COMPLETE Verdi, consisting of three Opera Arias?
1	I used it as a ring tone, the song doesn't start playing til its almost to late to answer phone. The song itself is great!!!
1	I bought the vinyl and had to return it because it kept skipping on the 2nd track on side B. The replacement vinyl I got skipped in the same spot... THEN someone accidentally got me the vinyl for my birthday, and sure enough it skipped in the same spot. Count your blessings if you bought a clean copy of this vinyl because I struck out with this one.
1	Always listen before you buy.  This is not the original version.  It is a speeded up, badly arranged, and badly sung cover.  Don't even bother trying to find the original at Amazon.  Go to ITunes.  They have it, along with this turkey.  Listen before you buy.
1	Only CD I own that has to be removed from CD player in my truck and reinserted every time you restart the engine in order to play without skipping.
1	Need to say Stevie Wonder is wonderful however there is talking at the end of the product.  It just randomly bleeds over the music.  Someone needs to review this version and correct it.
1	Let me preface this review by saying two things: one, I don't typically post reviews, but felt compelled to do so after listening to this album; two, I only became a fan of Mumford last year after catching their Live at Red Rocks show on an Apple TV channel.  Like some people, I initially didn't appreciate their folky sound, so my fandom consisted of singing along to "The Cave" when it came on the radio.  I was surprised at how good they were live, though, and how much emotion and depth they conveyed in their songs in the Red Rocks show.  Since I was a relatively new fan, I was looking forward to another album.  When I heard that their sound was changing, I was skeptical but still willing to give it a chance.  I've listened to the new album a few times now, and it's not just the replacing of their signature banjo/strings/horns with electric guitar/synthesizer/drum tracks that I don't like.  In their previous work, the emotions conveyed in their songs was palpable: passion, rage, despair, exaltation, regret...I don't feel that depth in the new album.  It isn't a terrible album.  Some of the songs are catchy, but they're not memorable, they don't move you, you don't feel that struggle of forbidden love and religious faith, of darkness and light.  I understand as an artist you want to evolve and experiment, but I think this is a devolution.  There's nothing unique about this sound or their new lyrics.  It feels like the soul of the band is missing.  If this is the road that Mumford & Sons is going to continue down, then I'm not going to follow.
1	Love this CD of Fifth Dimension songs!-only problem is three of the songs are messed up!! they stop & won't play-avoid this screwed up CD!! you are wasting your money!!-this is a shame because after McCoo & Davis Jr. left The Fifth Dimension had some interesting music & this is the only?? CD with that music on it!!
1	Sentiments of an Atheist, troubled soul, needs Jesus!!!
1	this album is complete trash save your $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ money worst album this year the music totally sucks he's way overrated
1	Dylan on automatic pilot
1	Sections of this are terrific, but some is just bizarre.i
1	This album is not available as a purchased digital download, which I found out to my chagrin after trying to buy it and download it twice (per Amazon rep recommendation).  Buyer beware.
1	i just knew i was going to like this because I like the 1st single with Andre 300 and I love the last cd. All i can say is WOW, so disappointed!
1	There is just no accounting for (lack of) taste.  I've read the reviews of this CD --- "brilliant" "soul singer"???????? What the hell kind of soul singer is that??  He just sounds like an old drunk or junkie who is slurring his speech before he nods off. Easily the most pretentious and annoying act I've heard (or seen) since David Gray.
1	I don't even know what this is.  I didn't order anything that looks like this.  I did not receive anything that looks like this,  and a far as I know, I never paid for anything that looks like this.  Maybe you can let me know what it is and I May give it a better rating.
1	ONE OF THE CDS WAS SCRATCHED???
1	I have this on vinyl and it ranks right up there as one of my favorite disco albums. Both "I Found Love" and "Accidental Lover" are typical of the genre of music called Eurodisco music coming outI in 1977. Other than Alec Costandino's Greatest Hits cd which is on Unidisc Records (Canada) and includes songs from both Love And Kisses albums as well as Alec's "Romeo And Juliet" which there has never been a legit release of any of his works. This Russian cd of Love And Kisses first album is a bootleg.
1	Horrible lyrics, stupid beats, and a sell-out Corporate band.  Listening to this song is torture.  The first time I heard it, laughed at how bad it was.  Mark my words, this song is going to go down as one of the worst of this decade.
1	Dylan is a fantastic songwriter and sings his own songs with a certain style.  I am a huge Dylan fan. But this collection reveals the emperor to have no clothes.  Listen to the samples for yourself.  Just because you can do as you please, doesn't mean you should.
1	The MP3 file I downloaded (Nov 2011) was noisy, especially at the beginning. It sounds as if the recording was off a dirty vinyl LP. While Amazon did refund my money, others should be aware of the issue. As for the song itself, it is a nostalgic favorite of mine.
1	I did not like it because I was looking for LP not single. Anyways, I sent it back and I was quickly processed for money return. It was needing more information on the add.
1	I expected this to be in a karaoke cd-NOT a download
1	This is the first album without Mick Taylor, and it shows. To use the title of one of their tunes from the Goats album, Black and Blue continued the mid-70s trend of the Rolling Stones "Coming Down Again" from the glorious heights of their '68-'72 Classic peaks. B&B is simply an uneven, if not amateurish performance, by a group touted as World's Greatest ROCK & ROLL Band.  This album has much more of a NON-rock & roll style. "Hot Stuff" is funky; reggae is evident with "Cherry Oh Baby"; and "Melody" is a little jazzy. Tellingly, only one song from B&B managed to (barely) crack the US Top Ten, and wasn't even a Rock and Roll number (Fool to Cry).  No, this can arguably be considered a low point in the Stones' output from the '70s, especially considering that Ron Wood was still testing out his wings here as a new band member. The album DID manage to score some notable PR for the infamous Hollywood billboard in which a Jagger-bound young model was shown to say  "I'm BLACK AND BLUE from the Rolling Stones -- and I love it!"  The resulting firestorm from feminist groups probably added to sales of the album, despite the mediocrity of the tracks. The lads from London thus continued their notorious streak of controversy for being "Bad Boys."  One last thing....  Just wanted to make some corrections on reviewer Jarchow's comment "Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording"  Technically incorrect.  -- The incomparable English pianist Nicky Hopkins played on numerous Stones' recordings, and on one or more Beatles recordings (e.g., "Revolution" from the White Album).  -- Guitar great Eric Clapton played lead ax on The Beatles "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," and recorded with Keith Richards and John Lennon on the tune "Yer Blues" for the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.  More technically correct, but still historically interesting, are the following:  -- One of the Stones played on a Beatles recording. Appropriately, this was Rolling Stones founder and talented multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who played alto saxophone on the B side of the Beatles' last single "Let it Be." The recording is a comedy-lounge tune called "You Know My Name (look up the number)." Jones was part of the recording sessions with the Beatles in early April 1967 for this composition.  -- One of the Beatles played on a Stones recording. That honor goes to none other than John Lennon, who jammed with Keith Richards (and Clapton, as mentioned above) on the Beatles tune "Yer Blues" for the Stones' 1968 Circus.  -- Head Stones Jagger and Richards joined the Beatles in recording their 1967 release "All You Need is Love."  -- Lead Beatles Lennon and McCartney joined the Stones in recording their 1967 release "Sing This All Together."
1	Oh please. Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up. Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana, yet I despise both. They both sold out. Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it. There's no punk sensibility to it at all.
1	I selected  this rating because I wanted to be fair. The music is off don't sound like the original beat. These are good song but the beat to these songs are off. No; I would not recommend this to my friend.
1	Not that Good
1	Of course the music is great, I love mac demarco, but the vinyl it's self constantly skips around and is very chopy, making it virtually impossible to understand some songs. Really disappointing.
1	I LOVE this album but to my disappointment it came already scratched and doesn't play a single song smoothly. Very very upset that I wasted my money
1	I have only listened to the samples of the songs in Amazon, but I'm sure it is right what another customer said. The CD loses its charm after 5 or 6 songs. Also, why would they add a version of Cielito Lindo on this CD? It is a Traditional Mexican song, not an Italian song. I like the album cover though.
1	Do not download this album. The sound is terrible. The CD sounds horrible as well. Wait for the the re-masters
1	A great slow song.  I loved this slow song when I was a teen in high school.  I think it came out immediately after "If I Ever..."  I thought the tall one was sooooooo fiiiiiiine!!!  Not too long after, I became a freshman in college.  Music has always been a great companion of mine.  Their unison's are great.  Harmonies A+.  Their tenor and baritone voices are great in this song.  It's a classic.  They remind me of the guys from "The Platters," I think that's my grandparents generation.
1	Love Josh Groban, but this is my least favorite album. I was disappointed with the song choices - of all broadway songs to pick, why these?
1	Overrated song
1	This is a wonderful rendition of an excerpt from "Eternal Father" by Claude T. Smith I really should have noticed the run time of just over 2 minutes if you just want a great French Horn quartet version followed by a solemn band arrangement of the hymn, this is your recording. If you want " Eternal Father" by Claude T. Smith, keep looking
1	It's not moral to sell CDs that infect computers.
1	This song isn't very good.  My daughter probably did this.
1	As much as I've always loved Iggy & The Stooges - I have to honestly give this CD a two-star rating. As far as what I could tell, this poor quality live Stooges CD was the only title that the French label Starfighter had ever put out. 'Live 1971 & Early Live Rarities' is dubbed as an unofficial release, just the same. First six songs here - "I Got A Right", "You Don't Call My Name", "See Me Dancing", "That's What I Like" + two more are from a very poor quality fan (obviously) recorded tape. Gig took place at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis sometime in May, 1971. However, all is not lost. The last four songs on this [for completists only] piece are actually okay - at least for demos and rarities. I sort of liked "TV Eye" and the aptly-titled "Ron's Jam". On the back cover, this CD notes "Due to unavailability of certain master recordings, surface noise may be evident on certain tracks". Yeah! You think?
1	Wasn't able to access after purchase
1	I bought this album during a time when I was relatively new to metal (I wasn't allowed to listen to secular or hard music as a kid) after hearing the cut "Ungrateful" on G-ROCK and loving it to death. What I ended up with when I got home from the store was what I knew even then to be a shoddily-produced album filled with what were obviously prototypical ideas. If you like blandish garage metal (that sounds like it was recorded in said garage) with blunt and goofy lyrics about being a sinner and... well that's the lyrical gist of the entire album, then you will probably enjoy "Indecision". I didn't, and still don't, so to me this was one of the bigger disappointments of my early music purchasing career. During a period when I was also coming across Christian bands like P.O.D., Project 86, and Five Iron Frenzy, this album found itself way at the bottom of the pile, under even Jars of Clay. Quite frankly, all of these reviews gushing heaps of praise for this sonically accursed thing strike me as probably all having been posted by two or three people using different accounts, because any other explanation just seems completely out of sync with any semblance of possibility.  HOWEVER...  If you surf the Interwebs, you will find cuts from a self-titled Gryp album that must have been released some time after "Indecision". On it are redone versions of tracks from this album that are a DRASTIC improvement over what is on display here, so evidently Gryp did find time to become a decent band, pretty damn good even. Information being scant, pack some luck in a duffel and look for that disc instead. Because despite the probable and unseemly circlejerk going on here, "Indecision" is not the Gryp you're looking for.
1	For those of you that love Bob Dylan's voice on this recording I have a suggestion- Ella Fitzgerald-Frank Sinatra-Joe Williams-Sarah Vaughan-Billie Holiday- Ernie Andrews--Nancy Wilson-Diana Krall-Blossom Dearie- Billy Eckstine-Tony Bennett-Nat King Cole  etc etc etc. When Ira Gershwin heard Ella Fitzgerald sing the Gershwin Songbook he said that's the voice I was hoping for to sing our songs-beautiful! When you listen to Bob on Freewheelin-Another Side-The Times They Are Changin" That is fantastic fantastic folk music! Bob Dylan a great Folk-Folk Rock-Americana Singer!
1	I never even heard this after selecting it as the first thing I was required to do was download more unwanted software.  I can listen to MP3 just fine with my existing programs so i shouldn't have to load someone's malware to listen to this.
1	this is a corny remix.  the 30 second clip avoids the awkward parts of this remix.  i would not recommend this version.
1	Disgusting.
1	This is truly one of the worst attacks on Classical music ever perpetrated by the philistines of this world.  This is not good music, not a good interpretation and not respectful to the composer or his music.  If you love Soul and Hip-Hop, that's fine. If you like Handel, I respect your good taste. This evil and tasteless recording should never have been made. The whole thing sucks.
1	A couple of good tunes you can download. The rest isn't worth having the CD.
1	Huge waste of money!!!!!!! I paid over $10.00 for 1 song that is six minutes long. Did not realize when I bought this album that it was only the one song. Will be contacting customer service!!!
1	I buy this record on my smart phone.  The download never came through and I never got the song. Can't get my money back, either.
1	I think I out grew babyface, hes a good singer but the songs just don't hit me like they once did.
1	More that half of this cd was the guy talking about sci-fi and horror movies and stupid s***. I bought it because the excerpt I heard was awesome sci-fi music. It's still on there but only about 1/4 to 1/3 at the end.
1	got very boring boring boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ugh ugh ugh so boring never again would I recommend it,it is just so slowwwwwwwwwwwww
1	this **** isn't even worthy of a review.. they inspired some of the worst bands in rock and roll history...kurt cobain was just no talent heroin user, . NO stars but i have to give it one for inpiring someone, thats all nirvana did. There are so may GREAT bands to represent the 1990's check out Oasis-(Whats the story?) Morning Glory and RADIOHEAD- Ok Computer...Nirvana had NO TALENT.. they were just in the right place in the right time
1	<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ride-the-Lightning-Vinyl/dp/B001543L92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ride the Lightning [Vinyl</a>] Metallica Ride the lightning is a fantastic album, by far one of Metallica's best, but buyers beware DO NOT buy the 2008 warner bros. vinyl LP Reissue. sound quality is flat and is INFERIOR to the cd version.
1	Ok
1	Very Disappointing .... Seth MacFarlane has a wonderful voice.  But his song choice on this album is very very poor, all sad and all very very slow.  What a wasted CD.  I listened through each track once "hoping" to find one decent song and did not.  I will never listen to it again, so I threw it into the trash.
1	I love her but this is not her finest work. Try her cd w Chet Atkins -- simpatico Better songs
1	I accidentally ordered this song and it is not very good.. bad lyrics and vocals
1	Love this song, however I purchased it & wasn't able to download to my MP3 player.  Wasted a couple of $$
1	Talk about a 60's lo-fi throwback.  I guess if you just can't compete in today's music world, why not try to make it as some sort of a roots revival type of group.  But the problem here is that it just doesn't compare well to anything that it seeks to emulate.  The production is very lo-fi, to the point of being painful to listen to.  The mix of musical styles (old Stones, early Beatles, The Kinks, along with other more obscure bands) doesn't quite blend well.  Quite simply, there isn't anything noteworthy about this song...the melody is flat, the vocals are annoying, and the musicianship is sub par.  Not really even worth a free listen, in my opinion.
1	not a good pair to sing duets together and some bad choices of songs (all covers,check the titles). Don't buy unless you aren't going to listen anyway.  I like both singers' music; it must have been fun for them to put it together but I didn't find it worth my time to listen to it very often or three times.
1	Horrible Recording........  Do Not Buy this CD.....  Terrible Sound.......  No Exception... Just Horrible....
1	Hurrible, I hate salsa, too boring, so it was a pleasure rating this product.  I am also glad this artist who likes like to somoke big blunt habaneros is gone for ever from the music scene.  I am just so glad that the 1990 decade is over and I don't have to deal with salseros no longer... Yahoo...  Today, they all are where they belong, collecting dust in the basement.  A pu tu ero loko, coje pa tu basement... loving it...
1	Thought it would have Disney voices. It wasn't what I was hoping for. It is a generic, elementary version. Ok for young ones.
1	such a waste. foreigner never had a chance after Agent P. Success and internal strife pulled the teeth out of these hard rockers. A healthy Lou G and a humbled Mick J should make one last old school hard rock album... even an EP to make up for this travesty and go out with a bang....
1	There's the King of Rock, King of Pop and now, after the release of Volume 5, we have the King of Karaoke.  I'm convinced there are two distinct families of R.S. fans. One appreciates Rod the artist and the other is delirious for his alto ego, Rod the snoozing crooner. This CD in particular, with its odd song selection, puts me in mind of David Johansen's (New York Dolls) late 80's alter ego Buster Poindexter.  B.P. was played with a wink and a smile and achieved a modem of brief success as the convivial lounge act. No one at the time dreamed anyone, including Rod, could maintain this novelty act for a total of five CDs over a ten year period (and still counting). One has to ponder whether Rod's mentor was really Mitch Miller rather the Uncle Clive.  I can't wait for Rod's preordained promotional visit to the TV show, the View. He'll chat up Barbara Walters about his love and affection for American standards and she can reminisce about her dates, in glamorous Holly wood, with Irving Berlin and being there when Irving wrote, "There's No Business Like Show Business". I can hear her now urging, begging Rod to add that tune to volume 6. Sorry, I digress.  Can you possibly imagine Lennon, Morrison, Hendrix, pumping out this musical bilge had they lived into the September years? This CD doesn't warrant a serious review. All one has to do is read the reviews offered for volumes 1- 4. Nothing has changed but song titles. All five volumes might as well have been recorded with the original CD in 2001. In fact, maybe all the tunes were recorded during this period.  I have a rule of thumb; beware of movies, books or CDs with titles that end with numbers 3 or greater  Let's face it.  This career direction is perfectly logical, when you take your counsel from the accountants rather then listening to your creative muse. Remember, He's now spent the majority of his life nestled in Beverly Hills, obsessing over polo ponies and such. Crooning Tin Pan Alley nuggets makes perfect sense. What else does he know at this stage? The lad is a long, long way from his roots in Gasoline Alley.  Just think, he turned down a recent Faces European reunion tour with his mates to market and promote this dreadful project.  It's truly sad when the business model trumps the artist.  Fortunately, other artists from Rod's generation are still out there creating, playing and performing relevant music.  I invite you to listen to recent CD releases , Ronnie Wood's " I Feel like Playing ",  Joe Cocker's "Hard Knocks "  Elton Johns' "The Union" , Neil Young's" Le Noize " and Robert Plant's" Band of Joy ".  These legends are following their muse and creating original work.  They're willing to take commercial risks to gain the creative rewards. As an artist, not a business person, that's what it's all about. Art / music, when it's real, is about excitement not safe.  As for Rod, I'd suggest exploring his back catalogue. The Great American Songbook series is nothing more then the "Long Goodbye ".
1	this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.
1	It didn't meet my expectations
1	This CD is billed as cruising music; however it would be better described as a blues CD. Sarah performs the entire album with a six string and a very bluesy voice. Overall the songs are about boats and people but very little content to get you motivated. I would recommend you listen to it before you spend money on it..
1	Not what I expeted , but ok .
1	it's only 4 songs
1	I clicked on a song that I wanted and ended up with this one.. I don't care for it at all.
1	How annoying is this song? He says shake about 50x and it gets so damn repetitive.  2 stars.
1	I HATE THAT I CAN'T GET TO PURCHASE THIS CD/VINYL/DIGITAL RECORDING ANYWHERE IN THE US!!!  ARRrrrrrgh! Why isn't this wonderful album released in digital format? Real fans will be forced to resort to criminal activity to get what they want....
1	Some really great songs- obviously talented rapper and lyricist. Haven't listened to it recently- but may go back.
1	Just a repeat of instrumentals from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Live-in-Gdask/dp/B001BKG9RQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Live in Gdask</a>, no new ideas, this is not new Floyd. The final song, "louder than words" does have lyrics, but spoil alert... it ends with "all we need to do is keep talking." Does this make it a missing song from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pulse/dp/B000002B35/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pulse</a>? No, just Gilmour digitizing his voice, again. Also, it shows to be two discs with two sides. Each side is less than 15 minutes and the entire album 18 songs ends just short of an hour.
1	I've been with Chevelle since the beginning, since Point #1.  I was at the shows where they actually played songs from Point #1.  I am a HUGE Chevelle fan.  I think they're probably the best modern rock band out there.  Extremely creative, heavy, with impressive song writing.  This album was absolutely a massive let-down for me.  Did they go heavier?  Yes.  Is there more screaming than any other Chevelle album?  You bet.  These are not bad things.  In fact, a new direction is cool.  Good to evolve and stay fresh.  But there's almost no substance.  And much of the album has the same sound.  There are few stand-out songs.  It's like Pete decided to go heavier and then put little to no effort in backing up the heavy with the usual Pete rock genius.  The album opens up strong, like most Chevelle albums.  Door to Door Cannibals is easily one of the best songs on the album.  I dig it for sure, although it's weaker than most Chevelle openers.  Enemies - one of the worst Chevelle songs ever.  This song is simply awful.  Even the recording quality is terrible.  It's just... awful. Joyride - pretty good, although one of their weakest radio songs.  I still dig it.  One of the album's stand-outs for sure.  Still, it pales in comparison to An Island and Hunter Eats Hunter off Gargola. Rivers - a weird mix.  Starts out with a weird vibe, like a serenade at a cheap Italian restaurant.  Then it goes heavier... then back to cheap Italian restaurant vibe.  The heavier parts are simply okay.  A weird mix and very mediocre song. Last Days - weak.  Just ... weak.  Same recycled sound from most of the album but with zero substance.  Filler. Young Wicked - this song had potential and was ruined by having kids chanting at a few parts.  Stupid.  Why?  Why, Pete, why?? Warhol's Showbiz - same tune.  Recycled.  No substance.  Boring. Punchline - slower but dark, like the vibe from Twinge off Gargola.  I like it.  I dig Pete going darker with his slow songs.  This is good. Got Burned - more filler.  Repetitive.  Not good.  Simply not good. Shot from a Cannon - maybe my favorite song off the album.  At just over 8 minutes, this is a stand-out and a new accomplishment for Pete and the band.  Pretty epic.  Solid.  Love this song.  Love the wandering path it takes.  Heavy and slow, but not boring.  Really, really like this one.  So... strong opener and strong closer, but the middle is mostly weak and repetitive.  By Chevelle standards, this album is awful.  By most bands' standards, this is a very okay album.  But I judge Chevelle against a higher standard.  Hats Off to the Bull was a masterpiece.  La Gargola was decent (for Chevelle).  This is much worse... easily Chevelle's weakest album.  I predict a lot of the excited positive reviewers change their mind after several listens.  I think it'll start to run together and people will easily burn out on this album.  I had in hand the day it came out, like my other Chevelle albums, but I may hesitate and sample their next album more before buying.  I hope they can get back on the upswing after this lackluster effort.
1	Worst CD ....dull, the songs all sounded alike,
1	Sorry, but I thought she had more talent than this. I guess she used to. I am not interested in spending money on her anymore.
1	Preface: I'm not slamming your music choice, your taste, or your judgment if you really liked this album.  That out of the way, this album is kinda meh for me. Having listened to Mastodon for a long time now I just don't feel it. I hear a lot of repetition, with nothing that really stands out in either the lyrics or the instrumentals. There is some good material here (The Motherload) and there (Feast Your Eyes' intro), but I found the majority mostly forgettable. It just doesn't match the creativity I hope to find in a Mastodon album. I have tried and tried and tried to re listen with hopes of catching some new perspective, but ever since release day it just hasn't happened. I've settled with the fact that the album's just not for me.  For what it's worth, this is coming from someone who's liked everything prior - Lifesblood through The Hunter.
1	I thought this would be fun with kids voices, but not everyone is singing at the same tempo and it is just distracting.
1	This is pop music for girls who think they're too cool to listen to pop music. Uninteresting, irritating, and wimpy radio ready pop music with no heart and soul. Essentially a few white guys doing some rap, reggae, and bland pop music. In one ear and out the other at best. At worst this truly becomes grating on the ears after awhile. This is only a step above Miley Cyrus and Justin Beiber. Yes it's that bad.
1	I was excited when I got this. Cause I dig Doyles catchy but heavy guitar sound. Nope,Not one catchy song on this! I was like crap! No one said this in any of the reviews. So now Im saying it. Im fine with the metal sound. But I expected a couple of kick ass catchy tunes. Also I think the singer tries just a bit to hard on being scary tough. When u open up the booklet and see the photo of him. I swear he looks like hes going for  the lates 80's/90's Danzig look. Anyways I  gave away  my copy. I might would have kept it cause I still like Doyles sound. But the singer just kinda got on my nerves.
1	I saw Van Halen six times during the Roth era starting in '79; they changed my life.  There was no equal to them back then in a live setting when the intensity of those first albums was matched equally by their concert performances.  I again saw them on the ADKOT tour in '12, and wish my memories of the original band had remained untainted by that last show.  Eddie and Alex sounded great.  Michael Anthony was sorely missed.  And Dave; well, Dave was left as an embarrassing caricature of his former glory.  This album pretty much chronicles what I saw in 2012.  To those who insist Van Halen was always sloppy live; search out the '82 Largo show on youtube to see them at their peak.  Did they improvise then?  Stray from the records?  Yes, but they did so with chops and ability, and a singer whose charismatic showmanship was backed by a unique and strong voice.  To those fans considering buying this album as a definitive statement of the live spectacle that is (or was) a Van Halen show, move on.  That voice, energy and conviction is gone, replaced instead with weird, Homer Simpson's dad vocals plowing through the hits in a final money grab.  At least do yourself a favor and listen to the sound samples first.  They are a good indicator as to how bad this sad effort really is.
1	This is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said. The only place that has the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of 80s CD. It sounds a little thin to me but its the right version at least.
1	Very disappointing for a Don Henley project. Don without Mr. Glenn Frey your finished. We all miss him I get it. So if you put your dramatized ego to the side long enough to allow the stench in the room to pass it's way outside Mr. Joe Walsh would join you for a smash hit project...maybe.
1	This was Sidewalk Prophets, Not Sandi Patty.
1	If you really want a recording of Hedwig and The Angry Inch buy the original OFF-Broadway cast recording with John Cameron Mitchell and Miram Shor in the lead roles.  Harris and Hall pale in comparison and the new arrangement of Sugar Daddy is just wrong.
1	I guess i was looking for the long version of the song. Seemed like most of the song i remembered was missing.
1	It was ordered for son, personally, I don't consider it music, and find it hard to rate it as such.
1	The one star is the rating that this crap I mean rap deserves. Cant belove they could make something so bad.
1	did not like this one.
1	I used to like this song, but now I think it's garbage, just like the "garbage man" who wrote it.
1	It is honestly very sad that whenever someone is talented, that they have thrown their voice away. Unfortunately, Rihanna has been one of those singers who has been so severely overexposed that the quality of her own work has diminished greatly, that her work has not been worth listening too. Her latest set of songs with Kanye West and Paul McCartney on Four Fiver Seconds has been less than striking from the heart. She really has not found better for her own voice, from start to finish. Bitch Better Have My Money, or BBHMM has been one of her worst songs she has came out in a long while. I definitely found this song that not only be just annoying, it definitely ranked much lower from her work from before. I definitely think Rihanna really has let her own voice go. It is definitely a song that not only that I do not recommend you download, it shows that whatever Rihanna has came out with is just not even worth it. Just go to someone else.  Song: F+
1	It was explicit and I wanted clean.
1	To say DLR's voice is bad would be an Understatement.  Did anyone in the VH camp stop and listen to this?  This is an embarrassment to their legacy.  Mike's High vocals are strongly missing here.  Wolf is a great guy but let him make his own legacy.  EVH is hurting his son's future, let him fly and grow away from VH!
1	To coin a phrase, it sound like a bad  holiday Inn band .
1	I spent $1.29 on one track.  I'm glad that's all I spent.  I came here because of the drummer's stupid advocacy for a lenient sentence for her rapey friend, but I decided to listen to her band.  I've seen videos of them on YouTube as well.  These ladies are mediocre at best.  Probably good for county fairs in the Midwest, but they  don't seem to have much potential, really.  The idea that these chicks are "grunge" is as plausible as the idea people attend Stanford University for its "party school reputation".
1	I will not be buying the CD "The Wild West".  The sample of the overture to "The Magnificent Seven" is not in the same style as the original Elmer Bernstein score.  This is the version I want.
1	I love this song however it only plays the first 15 sec of the 5 minute song. I would like another copy of this song or exchange/refund but there isn't a place on Amazon website to complain about the quality of a song purchased from them. Ugh.
1	Not my favorite.
1	Could have a $1.29 sale if on itunes or sold All Summer Long as a single...with the entire album as the only option they got nada!
1	what you are offering is not the Columbus Stocade Blues by Danny Davis it's I'll Fly Away. Wrong song under song title!!!!!
1	Horribly hacked versions of classic Bowie. shortened to make more room on the cd. Great track list, too bad
1	Except for Hell on Heels, I was very disappointed in the song selections for this album.  I wish I had just downloaded the one track on iTunes instead of purchasing the entire album.  Also, I was expecting a lot of harmony and it just wasn't there.
1	Crazy music
1	It is ok just not the same with out Sammy Hagger
1	I agree with Phil. I have EVERYTHING Jack johnsons ever made. This is by far the worst. Wheres the laid back soul soothing tunes Jack? The band, drums, etc is just not you. Before all you defenders jump on the Jack band wagon and say "hes an artist expanding his talents" or something along those lines, I say I listen to Jack because jack at his best has no peers. this album is far from being peerless. This album seemed, rushed, boring, and way too poppy for Jack. This is a dissappointment for sure, good thing I got it on sale because the CD might just become a drink coaster. Guess I'll have to keep sitting, waiting, and wishing that Jack gets back to his roots and puts out a JACK JOHNSON style CD soon.
1	Cannot download \; total waster
1	To me, there is really only one GREAT song on here.....not my favorite otherwise.
1	Although I had bought this long before I am writing this review, I will tell you now not to buy this as the stereo strings actually do ruin the quality of the recordings, not improve on them.  I prefer that you buy other releases that use mono sources such as the greatest hits compilations and boxed sets instead of this even though the price is right.  I sold my copy to my local used CD store shortly after I heard the CD a few times and even the store manager who is a Hank fan hates this package as much as I do and predicted that it would stay in the store forever but it got sold anyway.  This rates a 1 star but if you buy it and keep it, it is a curiousity piece only.
1	Boring
1	Downloads ask for last disk.  Unworkable.
1	Give us all a break. I can't listen to even the Amazon samples with a straight face. If anyone else sang like this he'd be laffed out of town. Forget his delivery or interpretations -- that's up to him -- but he's off key ALL the time. The recording engineer must have been choking down the giggles. I'd cut Dylan a break if these were The Shower Tapes, but this is a CD. Poor, poor judgment and a real revelation about Dylan and his record company. Note to Apple: If you cut a U2 type deal with Dylan to download this to all iPhone users, dump the stock first and build a moat around HQ.
1	This song is not his best recording of I`m not trying to forget. Also the send of the song was cut off.
1	WARNING: This isn't the original "But Then I got High" song by Afroman.  This is a remix version he did, which isn't as good.
1	The other reviewers are way off this is one of the worst Horn Rock albums ever. Former Blood, Sweat & Tears member Jerry Weiss is in this band. This album is very lackluster the songs are not very well written nothing on here stands out at all. Play On Player is a funny song but not in a good way. As a Horn Rock Expect i can tell you there are tons of albums better than this. Try  Rastus, Gas Mask, The Keef Hartley Band, Cold Blood, Little John, Sunship anything but this.
1	This is a kickin' beat, but this mix is not a longer version, it just starts over again when the song is done then cuts off half way through the repeat. Maybe the MP3 that Amazon has is messed up. Until it's fixed, this mix is NOT recommended.
1	I think it's a shame that they have their friends writing reviews suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echoes of eternity. This is by far the worst cd I've gotten in a long time, and the first that made me write a review. The singer may be the worst I've ever heard. Even my cat's cd sounds better. I am very bitter about the $15 I gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music.
1	Some types of megamix albums using uncredited vocalists are pretty good - Jive Bunny and the Master Mixers forged a career out of doing just that - whereas there's times when the results are pretty terrible.  This is one such album.  The line-up of songs used is quite impressive, but when you learn for yourself these are not the original artists, you soon discover what a mediocre album this actually is.  Fans of 60s music will probably dislike "Sixties Mix Volume 1", but kids - or those first showing signs of being interested in such music - will probably find this fascinating.  Even so, do yourselves a favour and check out those 60s compilation albums that use the *original* artists.  This is one example where the original versions are better. Jon.
1	The titles says it all....... Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Boring.... Too many effects...and still boring..... Loved the prior albums.  This one was well....boring....and annoying.
1	If you can find this recording on cd I recommend that you avoid it at all costs. I paid a premium for a copy and found it to have the worst fidelity any cd I have ever heard.(Mercury poisoning?)As for content:I played it(my cassette version) for the teenagers on a road trip and they laughed their asses off. I later learned that they were all on mushrooms at the time;but I still think it is Funny.
1	Seriously Amazon??? You can say goodbye to my business with this crap!!
1	It did not download.  It didn't download.  It did not download.  It didn't download.  It did not download.  I love their version of the song when I can hear it.
1	As an avid Pink Floyd lover, I expected another great album! This was NOT it and didn't even sound like what you expect from Pink Floyd. Was so disappointed I threw it in the trash!
1	Taylor Swift's attitude has really made me stop buying her music. Sorry, not sorry.
1	If you want to hear two guys in a sound studio making up annoying screams and moans, then this CD is for you.  They didn't record an actual howling wolf and crow for sound effects, they did it themselves an it sounds fakey. I did listen to some of the previews but the screams get repetitive with the entire track.  I was looking for some creepy sound effects to play as I passed out candy for Halloween.  Luckily I bought several other Halloween CDs in case some were duds.
1	So she's blasting us soldiers (goes along with the President) for our "shedding blood in the name of liberty"? Dang her, she's like Dixie Chicks! I don't suppose she blasted Geo. Washington for shedding blood in the name of liberty?
1	My favorite song on this CD is :The Lord is the Maker of them all. It is just great. If you like Guy Penrod, check it out.
1	This did not download onto my cloud player app on my computer nor did it download in my music folder nor did it download in my mp3player?????  I would like a refund please.
1	Have seen or purchased 4 products from them. Production values are poor. Music is surprisingly bad. Workout routines are repetitive beyond belief. This is coming from someone who has done a good bit of Kettleworx. If you Google reviews of that series you will find many complaints about production values and repetitiveness. Workout Muse make Kettleworx seem cutting edge and brilliant.
1	If you're like me you buy soundtracks because you liked what you heard while watching the movie.  If you appreciated the music during the first forty minutes or so of Seabiscuit then buy the CD; you won't be disappointed.  The soundtrack contains pretty much everything up until that point.  Opening credits, Howards bike shop, Frankies demise, the backwoods racetracks where Red Pollard gets his start and pretty much every scene at Agua Caliente, including the all female band at the Molino Rojo brothel.  It's when the major characters come together that the soundtrack starts to fall apart.  The stirring piece from Red and Seabiscuits first win together is nowhere to be found.  Track 10 may be titled Reds First Win but it should be called Reds Second Loss since it's the music from their defeat to Rosemont in the Hundred Grander, a piece so out of context with the rest of the themes it was only used that once in the film.  The anxiety ridden complement to the match race is missing.  Track 14-The Derby (what Derby?) starts out like the match race but there is no slow build up of tension and no release into Seabiscuits main theme as in the movie; instead it goes into that horrid Hundred Grander theme again after a brief pseudo match race intro.  The lovely little guitar bit played while Red and the Biscuit are trotting around the tree during their healing days is another notable omission.  You'd think Track 20-A Nice Ride would be the emotional final race at Santa Anita but it's not.  It's actually the end credits sans "If I Had A Million Dollars", unfortunately.  Overall, this CD is not a good representation of what on film is an excellent soundtrack.
1	Ghost of Graceland is the latest release from Swedish rockers Treat. Unfortunately, this album is a cliche of a cliche of a cliche. Its melodic hard rock, which isn't offensive on its own. However this sounds like melodic rock with some metal touches that seems made for a Disney Channel or ABC Family TV movie. The lyrics are insipid and cliched beyond belief. The overall sound and style is unbelievably corny and might make any adult with sound mind physically ill. There are some ironically enjoyable songs on this release, but this album is straightup CHEESE, and not in a good way. This is what happens when Twisted Sister meets the Jonas Brothers. Someone please kill me.
1	Steve decides too late that he needs an answer to Maiden member's solo projects and Bruce Dickinson's Skunkworks album, and so he goes from the Maiden "prog" to 90s alternative. The path to this is simple. Get "inspiration" from any numerous average bands pretending to be fresh floating around today, get an average typical sounding singer of today to sing the same post grunge meets Disney/r&b melodies. Write the average songs. Then spend many years polishing the average songs to try and play it as if it hasn't been done before. For the finishing touch, sprinkle a few of your trademarks on the top and put your household name on it.  On an interesting note, there's only two songs over 6 minutes, truly a feat, not easily accomplished, for Mr. Harris! The final song The Lesson is a well written song.  It's nice to see Harris do things out of the normal Maiden mold, but apparently he has no good ideas either inside or outside of Maiden. Given that reality, maybe the next bright step might be to write a biography.
1	This is basically an album of 1:45 long instrumental songs.  Whereas Division Bell was probably the best Pink Floyd album ever, this album seems to be just junk that was rightfully not included on Division Bell.  Only one song on this album has lyrics, the rest is just instrumental.  So if you are looking for an album to follow up Division Bell, this album will greatly disappoint. Download the song Louder than Words, it's actually pretty good, and save your money.
1	It's an interesting listen, but just doesn't do anything without having the show to back it up. Skip it and buy the episode on dvd or blu-ray.
1	There are two different versions of this CD and both are bootlegs. All the material contained is available legitimately so don't support the bootleggers by buying this!
1	Love the music - do not like Amazon music anymore.  Will not download to my phone music player.  Only to Amazon music, which I do not use on my device.  Says that it is downloaded, but unable to locate it on my device expect in Amazon music app.  :(
1	This is NOT the original group, but a re-record by some group of studio musicians.  Nowhere near as good or talented as the Original Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds.  If you are a fan of the original you will be very disappointed.
1	It would be nice if the description told you that the download version of the disc doesn't include the CD+G version needed for the karaoke machine to display the lyrics. Now I just have a bunch of instrumental versions of songs with no lyrics.
1	I DID NOT GET THE SONG TO DOWNLOAD
1	So much potential but it fell short. It sounds flat in my opinion. Maybe November Rain set the bar too high.
1	I've been looking for the correct version of "Who Knows Where The Time Goes" so that I can have it on a CD.  Every version I've come across is one that I've never heard before.  This track sounds like they took the first half (the original version) and sloppily spliced in a different track that sounds horrible and completely unlike the original --different time, twangy, country-western-like.  I know for a fact that this is NOT the original track that's on the Colors Of The Day album, because I HAVE the album.  So, I paid for a download that was not as advertised. I read in some other place on the internet that the original version of "Who Knows Where The Time Goes" was only on a 45 record Side B that had "Both Sides Now" on Side A. That is incorrect.
1	I adore Shirley Horn and this rip-off of her music is an insult to both her and her fans. It should be illegal to steal someone's music and do a "remix" like this.
1	Not what I expected
1	This is really a misleading title.  My husband is convinced its made by some amateur who has no clue about music.  Just because you play a tune using a piano, doesn't mean it is MOZART!  It really amazes me that someone has the nerve to put this together and sell it as Mozart.  It has "Oh Donny Boy" and "Itzy bitzy spider" and such songs along with some classical music.  How is that Mozart?!?!?  Its really awful!
1	Hate hate hate hate it she is worst singer ever she makes my ears bleed. People should not buy anything this no talent hack puts out.
1	I'm glad it was a free download. This was definitely not a traditional version.  I would not have ordered this.
1	i expected better
1	This has to be the worst holiday song ever made.  I can't believe anyone would actually pay for this.  I would not even download it for free.
1	Cover was cracked when I got it
1	Not dreadfully slow, but this is pretty mellow.  The only upbeat / catchy tune is "Failure" which unforfunately just sounds like something World Party would have done 15 years ago.
1	Inspiring!!!! This song made me cry. It reminded me that God does loves ? we demand especially when I a heart broken. I.can't help but sing along.
1	The production value of this disc left me cold.  Great songs, but did the producers skimp on the budget or what?  Get a drummer with some real chops to liven this up.
1	This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66!!!!! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.
1	one star for having the guts to record a song that is that bad. I could do better by farting in a microphone and enhancing it with the same software.
1	not what I was looking for
1	Does not even sound like the song I know he wrote! It sounds like they tried to jazz it up.
1	My CD player in my car ejects this CD everytime I try to play it,
1	This is the worst download I have. It was not uploaded properly. It sounds like it has skipped.
1	I bought this song as my band wanted to cover it. I am not a fan of his music. It is an ok rock song but very trite.
1	Did not order this
1	OK song. I think I remember really liking it as a teenager lol
1	As it turns out someone is upset that they are saying Led Zepplin stole this and morphed it into Stairway to Heaven.  Guess I'm tone deaf because I sure don't hear it.  I have heard Stairway so many stinking times on the Radio my skin crawls,  the skin didn't crawl with Taurus.
1	Not a bad group, but the material on this release imho looks like it was thrown together. I was a bit disappointed.
1	Do not purchase this version.  It is not even close to the original and is remixed poorly.  What a shame.  Glad I got my money back.
1	Great for if you are getting a massage but couldn't fall asleep to it.
1	Never like her first single and never like this song at all ! Quit hogging all the airplay and let the other artists shine for once. Please stop making music. Purchase my albums instead , you'll thank me later.
1	Definitely not one of the Main Ingredient's best albums. If you really love them, I'd say go ahead, but I recommend you get Tasteful Soul, Euphrates River, and Bitter Sweet before this one
1	I'd give it 0 stars if I could.  If you want some good rap, listen to Beastie Boys, Krs one, run dmc, nwa, dr dre, 2pac, or even eminem is better than this (at least he can write some good lyrics).
1	crap
1	Cause we were not happy with this item-we were suppose to get 100 songs and we only received about 30 songs---
1	Not what I thought or wanted
1	I found one's I liked much better. I just couldn't get into this one. Too new age for me. Try JC apps.
1	Brubeck and smith recorded three albums in this series the best of the three was the Riddle but alas its out of print now. I wish it was in a CD format so eveyone could enjoy the work.
1	nothing special of course. just like her other songs it sucks as usual. Isn't your 15 mins up by now?
1	oh my what were Manowar thinking? This is a complete let down. I've been a fan of thier music for a long time, and this is thier worst album ever. They need to do another concept album, a follow up to gods of war.
1	...because you have almost the exact same song in "With Or Without You".  All Linkin Park did is change the words and move a couple of chords around, making it just different enough to avoid plaigarism lawsuits.  Even the lead guitar part is an almost pitch-perfect ape of the Edge's.  2 stars, only because they picked an excellent song to rip off.
1	Same s***
1	Disliking Mumford and Sons is not something new.  Unfortunately, with the uninspired change in direction on Wilder Mind, a record so drenched in rock clichs, and without any sense of purpose, M&S make loathing the group almost as easy as not caring at all.
1	Highly indulgent release of ambient industrial instrumentals prove that not everyone should be completely free from label restraints. Reznor completely plays into the fanbase with this one, rarely constructing a track out of 36 that rises above mere NIN production exercise.
1	Doyle Lawson is one of my all time favorite bluegrass artists. I hae seen him in concert on numerous occasions. I own many Doyle Lawson cd's and thought this one would be just as good as all my other previous purchases, but I must say there are really only a couple of songs I really enjoy. Doyle Lawson himself doesn't even sing the lead in any of the songs. Not his typical style at all. More country than good old fashion bluegrass. If you like traditional bluegrass you won't like this, but if you favor more modern bluegrass country then this is right up your alley. I personally wished I would have just saved the money and maybe downloaded the 2 songs I did like.
1	Download the song How Blue can you get and skip the rest of the songs. This is coming from a Jeff Healey Fan. The title is fitting. Ugh...
1	This CD is awful! It barely even sounds like Aretha's voice, ugh! Do not waste your hard-earned money on 5hiw!
1	WOW, I threw this into my 8 track and took the T-Tops off my Camaro.  Frederic you did it again you sly dog.  Absolutely no girls yet again, just a toothless hooker.
1	I bought this album at a sale at Carrefour Penang. I have heard the great reviews of this album. Yes, Winehouse is soulful, but can she reduce all the swearing in this album? The girl is angry like Alanis angry or Imbruglia angry but please tone down the swearing! I can't even play it loudly on the stereo and it is really offensive.  And the version from Universal Malaysia - does not have any Advisory label!
1	Using a deceased soul legend's name for your teeny bopper song is distasteful at best. I highly doubt Gaye's estate agreed to this...I mean if they took issue with Thicke and Pharrell's (rather liberal) sample of his song/melodies on Blurred Lines, I'm pretty sure they would not be ok with these two nobodies exploiting Gaye's name for commercial gain.
1	Not the version you want, download the WB single from their self-titled album. ToP is bomb, this cut though is weak sauce. Real version is avail. on this site. (Just get the whole album....It's f-ing Tower of Power).
1	These sisters are boring, infantile folksters! They could be stars and go far, if they just didn't have to sound so melancholy! Thanx!
1	way too ecpensive why $39.99 it should be $4.99 i will report this
1	I love this song but I am disgusted that the end is cut off. I like the WHOLE song.
1	Sorry@ The Head and the Heart but I just don't get it. I would love to buy every one of your albums but this just it's worth the money.
1	This was one of the worst albums I have heard in recent memory. Matt clearly shows he is a little rusty, as he has spent 6 of the last 7 months in the hospital recovering from massive genital and anal warts. We all hope Matt starts making better decisions soon so he can recovering from this horrible album and disease.
1	Decent beat but that's about it. Initially I liked the song, but I hardly ever listen to this song compared to others purchased. It doesn't stand out much from other tracks or mainstream artists.
1	talentless garbage. EDITOR'S NOTE: every five-star review is as fraudulent as the man behind this tripe.
1	It is honestly so sad when a artist has became so overexposed, that they haven't been able to shine the way the used to when they were younger. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those artists that has been so severely overplayed, and overexposed like a robot that is too much, that she has just been not worth listening to anymore. The only talent she had was when she was a part of Destiny's Child. But on her own, she has oversaturated the market where it has been too much about her, and no one else. When she was starting to get out on her own, she had one or two songs, but that was it. Her collaborations with her husband though, not even exciting. Her song Deja Vu from her 2005 album B' Day, has not been impressive, trying to recapture the chemistry she one had with him on Crazy In Love, and sadly she does not impress at all. I really did not enjoy the song, and sadly it is not worth listening to, especially when it has been overplayed so many times. If you are really new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back and listen to when she did have talent as a part of Destiny's Child.  Song: D+
1	Terrible!! Absolutely awful! Waste of money!
1	Can someone explain to me why this crap gets played every day on the hour on radio stations? Especially rock stations that shouldn't be playing this anyway, it's not rock. Just another example of record companies paying stations to flog their music. It should be banned. What an irritating song.
1	Tried four times to get customer support no one ever did respond!  Then I returned it, maybe I could have liked it!
1	Offensive and inappropriate
1	This is not The Platters but a bogus group. Tee music is not nearly as good as the original Platters with the songs arranged and produced by Buck Ram for Mercury Records. All The Platters are dead except for Herb Reed who sang bass and is now 82.
1	No doubt he is one of the worlds finest tenors but this just doesn't "feel" right. The tempo and timing may be perfect for opera but not for what is on this particular CD. Sorry...
1	Sounds gross.
1	The album itself is absolutely incredible, however the packaging, and record itself was not. I bought the vinyl, and the first time I listened to it, it skipped, and eventually stopped during 'She's American,' I requested a return and replacement for it, and the second copy came the exact same way. It skipped and stopped during the exact same song as well.
1	Sounds like Train ripped off the Police on Cadillac Cadillac, wasn't interested after that.  Do young ears realize how unoriginal much of this Alternative  music is, pretty much copied.
1	They suck!  Nothing but noise.  Save your money. Heard good things, thought I'd give them a try, my mistake!  Money wasted...
1	Not what i expected the Da Yoopers version is far better
1	It's the clean version - didn't specify clean - wasting my time
1	I liked it the first time, when it was called Brave by Sara Bareilles. How can anyone say it's not a direct copy?
1	I thought this song would just go away and stop hogging all the airplay. This is not a dream its a nightmare. Completely bland and annoying. She must be stopped !
1	I'm confused as to how to listen to this track. Where do I go???? My review has nothing to do about Rihanna, she's great and I LOVE this song...that's why I bought it!! I was just disappointed when I went to listen to the song and I had no idea where to go. Why can't it just download straight to iTunes? It would have been so much easier!!!
1	arrived damaged.  Poor quality
1	what !
1	I don't purchase music at all, but I needed this song for a class project.  When I tried to insert it into a PowerPoint presentation, it wouldn't load.  Apparently, Amazon does not allow the music to be digitally altered.
1	I'm a huge fan of BB's earlier works. There's not a song on Saturate or WANA that I don't love. When I read criticism/reviews that this new album sounded too much like their previous work I actually thought that was a good thing and got very excited.  To my disappointment though, it wasn't really the familiar sound I remembered from BB's prior works. Most songs seemed to lack energy, guitars were very weak and Ben's voice sounds drowned out. It appears to be a post production issue but takes away from even the quality songs on the album. Aside from a few standouts like Breaking the Silence and Ashes of Eden, there wasn't much else that genuinely moved me emotionally.  That said, Ashes of Eden is probably one of BB's best works... ever.  I'm am curious to know though why there are so many 5 star reviews when this album is leagues below their first 3. I'm hard pressed to believe any 5 star reviewer would claim that this album is as good or better than those amazing original albums, so why rate this so high? Don't get me wrong, I'll love BB forever. I just hoped for something a little more reminiscent of their passion and energy.
1	I would want to buy this album. I had it as a "long Play" when i was a kid, hundreds years ago. But this cd does not inform about songs enclosed in it.
1	Having enjoyed "Ex's and Oh's" on the radio, I was excited to order the CD when it came out.  The first thing that hits you is the sound. It's loud. EVERYTHING is loud. I don't think I've ever heard a record or CD with less dynamic range. I thought record companies had stopped doing this!  Which is a shame, as Elle King seems to be The Real Thing. But if she has any leverage (and sense) she'll find a way to release a version of this material that doesn't grind the listener's ears to a nub.  I can only share first impressions as I've been unable to get through this disc more than two or three times: well-crafted songs, indelible voice, great retro Spectoresque Walls of Sound, clever wordplay, humor, and excellent musicianship. In short, a lot to potentially enjoy.  On the downside, the lyrical theme of "Ex's and Oh's" -- tearing through lovers and leaving them wanting more -- reappears on so many other songs it begins to sound like a broken record. Think Mick Jagger's lyrics for the Stones' Aftermath album, only brought into the 21st century with the boot on the other foot.  So get famous fast, Elle -- and snag a production team that does your talent justice.
1	not too thrilled
1	There were a few good songs.
1	Not what I expected
1	All her songs sound like one run on sentence with loud music drowning her out. Looks better then she sounds!
1	Alas this was not the original recording. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be.
1	Think of the back of any Audio CD - Silver, right? Apparently, this Tron Package throws functionality out the window with a "cool" black CD. While I'm sure I would have no problem playing this in a Sony Playstation, I had all sorts of problems with just about every other optical disc player in my household - my HK changer, Alpine head unit in my car, the internal drives in my macbook or my wife's Dell.... nothing played this disc. I finally dug up an old external Plextor from my basement and it read the disc and I ripped it into the computer.  I came "this close" to just hitting the torrent sites. What would have happened had I not been able to read the disc? Would Amazon (or any retailer I may have purchased it from) return my money? Nope, just another black disc - that's policy. I've gone through this issue before with Copy Protected "CDs" that wouldn't play and it is not productive. The shops have a rule against returning opened discs, so you are stuck with it.  I don't know why I purchase music anymore. It would have been easier to download illegitimately.  The music? Pure Daft Punk. Once you get to it.
1	Not bad for a free download will aid for rough nights when you have trouble sleeping best turned down low with a nice glass of a mellow red wine and a hot babe next to ya. good luck gee I thought that was silver wolf howling at the moon  on the cover
1	This song is not the original version. All of the production has been removed, and it sounds like they're in a can.
1	2 stars didn't have the dre sound. I really wasn't feeling it
1	A whore in her own right, she had an okay voice, just bought the song because it was from my era!
1	I can't believe that they put the video version of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Let-It-Go/dp/B000VZMROQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Let It Go</a>&nbsp;onto&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Just-Like-You/dp/B000VDDCHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Just Like You</a>. They totally butchered Lil Kim's verse on the track. Go with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Let-It-Go-Extended/dp/B000VZMRQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Let It Go Extended</a>&nbsp;instead. Even if you purchase the entire&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Just-Like-You/dp/B000WAYV5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Just Like You</a>&nbsp;MP3 album, I still think paying an extra $0.89 USD for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Let-It-Go-Extended/dp/B000VZMRQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Let It Go Extended</a>&nbsp;is worth it to get the complete song.
1	I really didn't like any of the tracks. Dylan's singing is clearer than usual.the band is tight and the material is excellant. All the songs have the same kind of arrangements and tempos so they sound too much a like. A good idea badly executed. If you love these songs or Bob Dylan you already bought this. Every one says it's great but I'll probably never listen to it.
1	I didn't even buy it
1	The first 10 minutes are great, sounds like Animals. But, then it goes on and on! Boring. What is the point of theBluray?
1	Only the first two minutes plays the actual song, then it starts a different song.  Not what I wanted, .........Amazon issued a >99 credit the first time it happened and told me to wait 48 hours, so the problem could be fixed.  Ordered again - problem not fixed!!!!!!
1	I like about 1/3 of the songs on this cd
1	If I could give this zero stars or "minus 5 stars" I would. This album is crap, garbage, unlistenable (and I've listend to it twice and for the last time). Valentine must think he is the new Phil Spector only Valentine's production is a "wall of noise" not a "wall of sound." What's with all of the gratuitous and excessive slaps, stomps, drum programming, catter-walling background vocals - even the keyboard and guitar parts are used for "percussive" effect rather than melody. Grace has a powerful and wonderful voice but it is wasted here and often seems mixed too far in the background. The songwriting is terrible. The overproduction makes almost very song sound the same. Some reviewers think this has a disco feel. I hated disco - but this is even worse. Some compare it to Britney Spears - this album makes Britney Spears and the Spice Girls sound talented. Grace - lose Valentine ASAP and get your head straight again. This ranks among the worst five albums in my over 2000 album collection and one of the worst I have ever listened to in the last 50 years!
1	couple songs on album are good, rest suck. very disappointed.  the hit on the radio is really funky and a couple other songs are funky, but then some are super cheesy.
1	I'm sorry, but I don't see the appeal in this album.  At all.  I think Dead Man's Party, Dark At The End Of The Tunnel, and So-Lo are examples of much better albums, but then again I prefer their more 80's pop-oriented side.  Honestly, I can't find a single song here that I like and that's a pretty sad thing.  It's a good thing they changed their name on this album, because this is the pits.  I do give props for Elfman's songwriting skills, but the music itself just isn't enjoyable at all to listen to.
0	This song brings back so many memories of listening to my uncle play this song over and over.
0	Follow the Drinking Gourd  I liked this recording as it is in the folk style, which suits the song. It gives the students a better feel for the song. It is not commercialized.
0	The title says it all!
0	I  absolutey  love this, as I do  everything  by this group.  I hope they can still carry on somehow after anne rabson's passing last year.  I've seen them live and they sure do put on a show.
0	Love all of his work.
0	This is not the version I remember from the radio.  The different arrangement is obvious from the start.  Still, the vocals are great and the lyrics are strong.
0	Great song!! Very good Price!! Easy to buy! Love the song! Easy to download! Good singer! Great selection of songs!
0	I got this for my Christmas Mix For People Who Don't Like Christmas. I am not one of "those people" but this way I get to listen to Christmas music without too much whining from my friends and family who are.  This whole album is lots of fun!
0	Lila Downs continues to reinvent herself and never disappoints. This is one of her best. I cannot stop listening to this cd.
0	good cd for the collection
0	It is from Taylow Swift, so of course it's awesome.  I particularly liked the songs, "Red" and "I Knew You Were Trouble." my 12 year old daughter and obvious Taylor Swift fan says.
0	Absolutely love this song!
0	Music for the entire family. My husband saw them perform on the Grammy's and liked them, so it was a must-have birthday gift.
0	This original version of "When You Wish Upon A Star" is beautiful and my favorite.  It brings back some inspiring moments when I viewed Pinocchio as a 6 year old with my mother.  It was such an inspiration, I wanted to stay in the movie theater and see it again.  You could do that many years ago and we did.  The song has stayed a favorite with me all my life.  I can understand why it received the academy award for best song of 1940.  There have been many new versions of it.  As hard as they keep trying to change the melody "jazz it up" "rock it up" hip hop it up" you name it, they can't improve on the original version.  Some things are best left the way they were.  Tommy
0	great
0	Had found a Williams-Sonoma Christmas CD at the swap meet and fell in love with the compilation of songs and found that I could order many more on Amazon.  And am an extremely happy camper.  Oui, oui, this is a wonderful CD with excellent artists and songs.
0	love it
0	Just a great song-Love when Amazon gives credits for slower shipping and I can get songs for free.
0	Brilliant! I have not seen the show (hope to, some day) but the music alone is phenomenonal!
0	Great tune from Satch!  This is how music is supposed to be in the real world.....not this autotuned computerized crap they try to pass off as music these days.
0	Good simply to motivate you! A Kundalini teacher played this during class and I was happy to have found it here!
0	Good song-good song-fill in the fill in the blanks-its a good song what else can I say. Buy one for your girlfriend when you're about to break up.
0	Great performance
0	plays great
0	Love this song
0	Still the best rendition of the Star Spangled Banner!  www.k-mille.net
0	Love this music. It can change you -- in the most positive ways! Thank you!
0	I am surprised to be the first to review this CD.  Nonetheless, after wearing out two original LPs, I was happy to discover the first of the three Rounder Records was out on CD and bought it immediately.  As I usnderstand, and you can see from the photo, this record was made "live" with two microphones, recorded outside after a summer of touring in the early 1970s by the Highwoods String Band.  I was a member of bands on the East Coast that emulated the Highwoods foot-enthralling-stomping style, but there is no substitute for the real thing, and this is it!!! Anyone who was as a Highwoods concert couldn't forget it.  I have corresponded with one of the active memebers, Walt Koken, to see if a DVD of portions of Highwoods concerts could be put together, but so far, without success.  A "Highwoods Live" album has been produced, on CD, which is excellent.  However, seeing Walt Koken and Bob Potts wind up their fiddles for another old train tune is something not to be believed, unless you have seen it.  I strongly recommend this album, especially to new generations of musicians who are not familiar with the exciting styling of 1920s-30s old-time fiddle band music brought back to life in the 1970s by the Highwoods String Band.
0	Birthday Present for my Grandson.  He was thrilled!
0	Best version of one of my favorite songs that I've ever heard.  Watch it with video on YouTube to take in the whole scenario, visually stunning as well as a joy to listen to.
0	Music is a personal preference and therefore ratings don't see too appropriate.  But, I do like the song.
0	Very powerful vocals, reminds me of The Temptations Dennis Edwards. Very catchy lyrics & smooth rhythms.
0	Excellent product
0	I love this song and I played it on my way to work.
0	This is certainly another great artist singing from her soul. The availability of this music on Amazon is one of the features I so enjoy. It was fast and easy and I was enjoying some very soul moving music.
0	Fun track, wish I didn't get the censored version
0	It's funny how people discrespect one of the best and most influential Rock albums of the 20th century. This album was truly unique upen its release and you can hear how many bands tried to copy its style and sound.  The album kicks of with the classic "Smells like a teen Spirit" every rock fan in the world knows this song, it doesn't matter how old you are, you've heard this song before. "In bloom" "Come as you are" "Lithuim" "Drain you" are all timeless rock classics. But all the songs are great, if you're a rock fan this album is a necessity.
0	I recently bought the movie on a 3 dvd/ set.  So I decided to get the album to add to my My Sonny & Cher/Cher music collection.  The songs are pretty OK. Typical 60's stuff.  I ordered one then I thought I'd canceled the order. But didn't. and ordered from somebody else. come to find out when it was too late to cancel. I had ordered two. But this one was cheap. I think $2.95
0	great song to reminisce
0	Superb live collection of one of the world's finest guitarist , spanning from small intimate bars to massive auditoriums . Mason has always proven to be one of the most energizing live performers for decades now . The mastering is EXCELLENT and if you have a nice sound system you will not be disappointed !   The album opens with Bourbon St Bang ( close your eyes and you can feel the vibes of the French Quarter drift into your home ! ) . For myself , there is not a throw cut in the lot , but some of the highlights for me are the majestic soul of " Serenata" , the sure power of "Loaded Down ", 0 to 60 surge of Mason's classic " Courage " from his sophomore effort and his AOR hit "Gypsy Blood ". Check this out , you can't go wrong with this !
0	Great song
0	This guy can really get to the heart of the soul.  Great music for this day and age.  Jusr put on your Bose and loose yourself
0	Great spin song - really gets you moving!
0	I love the song.  Toni Braxton and Babyface sound perfect together. I want the whole album now. It is 5 stars.
0	Nice song, Mr. Grey will see you now.
0	I love Empire and the soundtrack. This song is wonderful.
0	This song will probably be played at my funeral. Just saying. Buy it. Buy it now.
0	Awesome song!
0	This cd was fantastic!  I love their song Innocent, which is a great testament to guys who want to be better than what is portrayed nowadays.  Superb lyrics great rockin' rhythms, I recommend this to anyone who likes a good upbeat tune!
0	This band is so good!  There last album was good.  This one is even better!
0	I am still not tired of listening to this CD!  Love it, love it, love it.  And you will too.
0	Well done Adele - love it.
0	Was great loved it
0	Great song from the nineties.
0	This is one of my favorite songs. No matter what I am doing or how I am feeling, this song brings a huge smile to my face. I have to pause to sing and dance when this song plays.
0	Excellent acoustics. It is just as good as the version produced by Radio Head... maybe better. I would recommend downloading it.
0	every need a song that is all dedicated to the beautiful sounds of the ocean. then this is it. I love it because it make think that i'm at the beach or something. a great song for falling asleep to after a long day.
0	A must have,could be part of my desert island 100.
0	Awesome CD by an awesome artist!
0	Album Of A Generation
0	When no other woman will replace that one woman in your life
0	dub step is all about building up to the drop and knife party has been able to do this time and time again. This album may only have a few songs but it is absolutely worth the money. I find myself listening to it all the time and my friends love it. Most people have not heard of Knife party and are often intrigued and find the music fascinating.
0	My favorite song from the album, a lyrical masterpiece, and Travis' voice is as good as ever.
0	Great!  I love Patsy Cline.
0	David has definately hit one "outta the park" with this one. Once again, he has taken a past hit and brought it back to life! Looking forward to the new album even more!
0	Awesome , I love it .
0	I got this cd last year from my neighbor who burned it 4 me. This cd is so awsome. From the start of the hardcore teen anthem of Smells like teen spirit 2 the end. They are so revolutionary. I consider Kurt Cobain the Tupac of Rock. Kurt Cobain has such a tragic story. hE PERsonifies what it looks like for a normal person 2 be a rock star, he just didn't know how 2 handle it. Excellent drumming and awsome bass and guitar. The created the modern day punk rock scence and are responsible for one of my other fav bands: green day. IF U LIKE THE OLD GREEN DAY THIS IS A MUST BUY!!:)ANOTHER great track is polly which shows kurts softer side. he stood up for gays and was againts racism. He is truly amazing and a tragic person.
0	Love this song!
0	Shirley Murdock voice brings back the good times of yester years. You will not be dissapointed with this one. Real good mellow sound.
0	This CD features jazz legend (and saxophonist) Sam Rivers with members of his trio (Doug Mathews & Anthony) joined by young trumpeter Jonathan Powell and trombonist/composer David Manson. The compositions are angular, clever and postbop (in style) while the soloing is spirited and very connected with each specific composition.  The recording balances form & groove with freedom and spirit very well.  Modern jazz fans can appreciate it and those who like their jazz on the experimental side will also like it.  Sam Rivers recorded this when he was 79 years old and he sounds awesome!
0	these guys tear. it. up. i've seen 4 live shows and i've never been disappointed. they just announced their going to rothbury, mi for the electric forest fest at the beginning on july. I'M IN! i think ya-ka-may is their best album yet..can't wait to see what else unfolds!
0	This song was an easy download.  The cloud player/downloader makes it very easy to purchase Mp3 songs from Amazon.  I also love the deals that are available via the music store.
0	This is by far my favorite song of all time. It is timeless. Mac Powell and the boys know how to apply the words of David to our time.
0	Great song!
0	Great song
0	The Cathedrals are really great on this recording.  3 of the 5 guys are now in heaven but the recording keeps their memories alive.
0	Classic!!!
0	This is humbling and I hear meekness that urges me onward inspirationally...I love this singer more than I can say.
0	Cool dual vinyl
0	This is my favorite song by Prince.
0	Trying to replace some very old vinyl for my mom. This album has some classics you can't find anywhere else.
0	Great sound! Relaxing easy listening songs that are PERFECT for island beach vacation mix! Never heard of the group but found it on line looking for songs to inspire me for our up coming virgin island trip. Takes you right to the feel of relaxing on the beach in a hammock. Give it a listen, you won't be sorry. Enjoy!
0	one of the great songs just one of the greats that Kenny sings. What can I say the man is awsome .
0	Love this song.  It just makes you want to dance!!
0	All good love it
0	great
0	There is nothing more to say than it's pure Zac Brown - smooth, great harmony, inspiring and makes you smile.
0	This is truely KoRn. It has the raw attitude of their older albums and some really great riffs and drum beats and phenomenal vocals. JD sings with true passion in every song. Overall the album sounds like a combination of all their albums except one which is See You On The Other Side I don't hear any resemblence to that album which is actually a good thing. The Opener Uber time draws you into Oildale Which is a very epic song and is a great way to start the album off. Pop a Pill is also one of the heavier songs and is just as epic as Oildale and has a very amazing riff. Some other highlights of the album are Let The Guilt Go, The Past, and Are You Ready To Live. Overall the whole album is a huge highlight in KoRns career. This far into their career and they are going stronger than ever. This is definitely a buy for any KoRn fan and anybody interested in music in general. If you're a KoRn fan then why are you even reading the reviews this is KoRn and it will always be so buy and you'll love it unless you don't like KoRn.  I got the special edition in a box set i ordered and its awesome. The extra song trapped underneath the stairs is very cool i don't see why they wouldnt include it on the standard edition. People pleaser on the other hand is good but not great i rarely listen to it i usualy skip it when listening to the album. I love live stuff so the live blind is a great edition for me. The dvd is cool but its a one time watch thing. Its cool seeing them record in the studio but its only enjoyable once.
0	Awesome.
0	A classic in the Genre!
0	Love it
0	As Prince was fond of saying: "Real music by real musicians!" Prince went out in style with this one. Funky, jazzy grooves throughout make this one of my favorite albums (by any artist) in years. Stand out tracks include "Black Muse", "Stare" and the stunning "Revelation".
0	Love it.
0	Caitlin Crosby is an amazingly talented new artist who has a lot of really good things to say to the girls of today [...]. I hadn't heard of her until I saw that Amazon had this song as a freebie and I dl-ed this one and also Imperfect Is The New Perfect (which is awesome). Tonight I had the pleasure of stumbling upon the video for Still Have My Heart on youtube and even before it was completely done I added it to my favorites AND my facebook. After my next payday I'll definitely be getting the whole album onto my mp3 player ... if I can wait that long!
0	I've loved Casting Crowns for years and this new album does not disappoint. I am now more excited than ever that I get to see them live in a few weeks. I've been listening to this in my office all day. Each song provides encouragement and hope. My favorite song is "What If I Gave Everything?" What a great question. It speaks to where I am right now and builds on the theme of having deep water faith in the shallow end that they've expressed in earlier songs. This song is a challenge to really step out and do what Jesus calls us to do, to love like Jesus calls us to love. The imagery of being called into deep water is powerful and the image of playing with sand when we have the faith to move mountains is convicting.
0	When I think of a Linkin Park song I definitely think of songs with much more substance than this.  This song would have been much better had there been more lyrics and a little more depth.  However on the bright side the song sticks with you and stays in your head.  The beat and the lyrics stay with you and you find yourself hearing it in your head for a long time afterwards.  That's why I took off one star.  I pray to God that the other tracks to the album are much better and knowing LP, they will be.

0	Beautiful ballad, uplifting message of love and devotion in this inspiring song about  a successful marriage and happy life. A foreign concept in today's world of selfishness and greed. This young couple rose up from humble beginnings in 1923. Reminds me of my sweet grandparents. This is a rare gem and one of the sweetest love songs of all time.
0	Catchy and heartfelt song. Would definitely recommend it to anyone!
0	There are only a few songs that can be said to have achieved "anthem status" for each generation....this is one of them.
0	4AD This Mortal Coil 5 Selected Originals. Selections from the Box Set.  Songs: Tim Buckley-Song to the Siren Rain Parade-Carolyn's Song Big Star-Kangaroo Roy Harper-Another Day Chris Bell-You and Your Sister  Plain Case, no art work, promo item.
0	I heard this song years ago on the end of a John Leguizamo  show and I liked it , so it took me awhile to find it but as usual I found it on Amazon.
0	Great for party's
0	I heard the song over the radio and immediately had me dancing all around the house.  But, what amazed me was WHO sung the song!  Robin Thicke??  Get out of here!  Outstanding!!
0	love love love this song!!
0	An oldie that I just had to get and am glad that I did!  Check it out, I think you'll enjoy it.
0	What can i say i've always like the song, wish that she hade made more, Come on Jamie make somemore songs
0	great song listen to it all the time was able to download it quickly. glad it was available thank you
0	That's my jam
0	this is a pretty good version of this song. i like the original and most other remakes. this guy has a good singing voice but i never heard of him. so now i will look up some more of his songs.
0	Great song and got it for free!! Nice way to try out a new artist you are not familiar with!
0	I love this song!
0	2Cellos and Time for Three are my two favorite cello groups. They are classically trained and play creative arrangements.
0	Outstanding salsa!
0	My favorite Akron/Family album is "Love is Simple." My second favorite is their debut album. I think both of those are a bit less polished than their subsequent albums and more aggressively psychedelic. This one is similar in feeling to those, if a little spacier; not surprising, I think it came out between those two. Some of the songs remind me of Syd Barrett ("Gone Beyond" in particular). Others threaten to swerve into a kind of beautiful industrial thrash. Meek Warrior is short, but it's really good.
0	My 11 year old girl could not wait to have the CD in her hands. We had already bought the set about Sir Francis Drake so With Lee in Virginia was already a "most have" for us. I am from Mexico so my knowledge of American Civil War is very limited. All my readings so far had been from the "North" perspective. Having the "South" perspective gave me a much richer understanding of the war. The story was very engaging, my girl keeps listening to it over and over. She has also learned a lot about the value of life and  loyalty. Each character is very well portrait and you can easily love them or hate them which brings the story a life. I have recommended it and lend it to my friends so they can also buy their own copy. We are budgeting to buy the next story. A family's favorite!
0	I wasn't into this band at first, cause I thought the vocals sounded a little too whiney. But one of my friends told me to give them another shot. I got a free Amazon gift card, so I bought this. I dig them a lot, sound like Dear Landlord, The dopamines. Both bands I dig a lot. If you are into fast, loud punk rocker singing about how life sucks go for it. I also bought their newer album, I think it's called sental island er something on vinyl. That's also a good one.
0	Its just the right pace.  The words are fantastic and rhythm is infectious. An English version would be interesting to hear.
0	This track is perfect if you are looking for just rain.  My wife likes to listen to rain while sleeping, but towards the end there are annoying birds that wake you up just as you are drifting off.  I ran across this MP3 while on a trip to Texas.  I forgot to bring a rain maker so I downloaded this to my phone to play while sleeping.  It was exactly what I was looking for, just rain.  If you want an MP3 that only has rain throughout the entire session then give this one a try.
0	What a fantastic album! Sure hope to catch them live someday. Along with Pokey LaFarges' "Something In The Water" and Eilen Jewell's "Sundown Over Ghost Town" this is one of my top picks for 2015.
0	I love his voice and the CD is very good.
0	This is my favorite CD!. Elvis was one singer I grew up hearing and I like his way of singing. He sings hymns and spiritual songs as if they are just for him. I sing along while I drive and know they are special songs to me. Great Collection for me to play often.
0	nice
0	I play this music when I'm trying to get some good sleep, or when I am trying to focus on something.  It is well produced and coherent.
0	I love a lot of songs by the band. fantasies was also a great album but i acquired most of the songs individually and this was just one of the last ones that i needed.
0	...to pair with the Divine Medicine, as always.  The album had a nice chill stellar flow throughout. :)  Namaste. <3
0	Reminiscent of the 80's power ballads...very cool!  Makes me want to dance, and grope my fella!  Seriously entertaining music - timeless.
0	great song! i love avenged sevenfold but this one really gets whenever i listen to it, defnitely check out this song as well as their nightmare album for more. ^_^
0	Love the new CD!  Music is a mixture of Indie and Pop = Sanjaya's own unique style. I'll admit I wasn't sure what to expect .. the samples on the Amazon site aren't great quality, but once I got the CD in my hands - I was pleasantly surprised.  The songs are catchy and fun.  I'm enjoying them very much and even went as far as adding them to my work computer, home computer, PalmTreo and mp3 player (of course!).  ^_^x
0	Great song! Love Kenny! He will have you from hello! Could listen to him all day! Will purchase more later!
0	This is a great collection of early Bangs/Bangles recordings.  Michael Steele plays bass on only two live tracks; the rest of the songs have bass supplied by Annette Zilinskas or Debbi Peterson.  The set includes both sides of the first Bangs single, the entire IRS EP, and some other rarely heard recordings.  A bargain at any price!
0	Powerful song from a legend.
0	Always been a fan of this one. Forgot the name/artist the other day, Googled it, and bought it here. One of my favorite contemporary worship songs.
0	Awesomeness!!! ((d-_-b))
0	Just about every song was what I expected coming from z-ro..the little catch phrases..like , you be hating like if you was getting paid for it..lol
0	I bought this so I could listen and reminiss.  I have to aggrevate the kids with my old music from highschool.  Nice to hear the music I love again.
0	I heard this on TV too.  Had to buy it to hear the entire song and  enjoy it a lot.
0	Music is great.
0	Good sound quality
0	All time favorite song ever produced. Lynard Skynard sing many many great songs;But Curtis Lowe maybe about a blues player gone unnoticed. There were many blues players with the same luck.
0	As always, Paul McCartney has released what I consider a great set of songs. I have to listen to each song at least three times before I get a feel for what he's doing -- I have to do that with every piece of music regardless of artist. I just love what I'm discovering in these songs. I find it so different from his previous work and is of some of his best to date.  It's truly McCartney in every way, but really new stuff. My favorites are "I Can Bet" and "New". I imagine that several more will become my favorites too as I listen more.  I certainly recommend this release to those who love McCartney's music. If you have a sense of what his career has been, you'll love these songs even more.  For those who are not familiar with his music this is a great release that I think almost anyone would thoroughly enjoy. This guy rocks, writes great slower tunes, and delivers super lyrics with some of the most unusual sounds throughout his music.  It never quits with him.  Go for it Paul!
0	I absolutely love this music. Dionne Warwick is a wonderful artist and has been a favorite of mine mpfor many years now.
0	Just really like this song!
0	Great song from the Santana Brothers.
0	One of the first, still one of the best.
0	This is a great song, and almost a theme song for Raise the Roof Project, a ministry in Mobile, Alabama.
0	Latin and Ray Charles! What a great combo.
0	I Really enjoy this CD. Every song is wonderful and that is rare in an CD these days. I had bought it for ONE song and ended up liking the entire CD. I enjoy the words and the music and the way its blended and different caliber of tones. I have listened to this many times. Its relaxing too at spots. I don't know if ONE Republic could do this good again. I'd recommend this CD to those who like what I described above in a CD.
0	i enjoyed every song and brandon flowers unique voice and compilation of the lyrics and music. play it all the time.
0	We are huge Laurie Berkner fans and couldn't wait for her Christmas album, but told my daughter we had to wait until after Thanksgiving to listen to Christmas music. Downloaded it this morning and we LOVE it!  In true Laurie fashion, it's music a parent can listen to and get stuck in their heads without going insane and my kids are singing songs even when the albums aren't playing. Laurie is very talented and her combo of old Christmas favorites and new stuff is great!  We will be dancing to this album all Christmas long!
0	Infectious music that sounds better the more you pay attention to the narrative.  It's easy to lose yourself to the toe tapping beats contained in Strange Tails, but after several listens, when you start humming the lyrics, it just gets better.  The twists the narrative takes through the course of the album delivers some great grin-inducing ironies too.
0	Love it.
0	Although this is not the same exact version that I knew from a "Supernatural" episode, I still loved the sound and its haunting quality
0	John Barry is just a tremendous talent and this piece explains why I can make that statement.
0	The quality was great.  And it came in 5 days as promised, and it brought back all the beautiful memories of the Telenovela.  I am dying to get the one with 100 songs I have waited 6 months and it is still unavailable.  If you want this CD buy it this instant because they do not have many and they are scarce and difficult to get.  And you will love it and be so happy that you bought it.
0	Added to a collection of nostalgic songs I'm assembling.
0	My favorite song for a while there. I still love it.
0	This is David Draiman at his best. Love that he is taking the time to give us more of his amazing talent in this venture. And the others who have joined him are equally talented and brilliant. Love it!
0	Kristian Stanfill has an amazing voice. I have herard several singers and he is by far most the best. Giving Our Lord, Jesus Christ, praise in the form of music is one of the easiest ways to connect with God. If you just listen to the words of a Christian song and apply it to Jesus' life you can sing yourself to be able to understand what He sacrificed for us. The words of this song tells a beautiful story of Jesus.
0	awesome
0	This song is outstanding!  It's perfection!  The harmony of the voices is amazing.  I guess you might say I really love this song!  I highly reccomend this song to everyone, for sure I do .........  PS: I wish I could give it 10 stars .....
0	Wouldn't have got it if I didn't like it, right?
0	Having seen Placido sing opera live in person both in Europe and in Los Angeles, I was looking forward to getting this CD after seeing him sing "Besame Mucho" on  The Tonight Show.  I am not disappointed.  Placido has a beautiful singing voice that compares favorably to Pavarotti, but is more dulce to Pavarotti's and in my opinion is better for singing more popular songs as offered here.  The CD features a number of duets that work well, and this is a very pleasant CD to listen to with friends and a nice bottle of wine.  Romantic without being smarmy, this is a CD that is in my current rotation and makes me happy.  Bravo (again) Placido.
0	The music of my childhood. It's good quality and I was very happy shipping was fast. Great old memories from another time.
0	Like a female r Kelly song
0	These 3 young men are fantastic!  Absolutely heavenly voices!  All have unique voices that blend together beautifully! I, for one, want more!!
0	Fantastic. As good as it's reputation. Lucinda is a wonder.
0	I love this rendition of these songs. Sometimes i just don't feel like hearing words but want something upbeat! This is IT! Recognizable songs you can hear the words in your head.
0	The slender, self-proclaimed anti-alcoholic, Muscles, may like handing out fruit, but his talent really lies in producing catchy, feel-good, and at times funny songs, over upbeat, lo-fi melodies with raspy, off-key vocals.  From Victoria, Australia, Muscles brings a youthful rebelliousness with his lyrics; Each song could be described as random, to say the least. His 2007 album Guns, Babes, Lemonade is a feel-good ride that makes you want to break it down in a Melbourne club and tell your teacher 'puck you miss'. Despite the oft-off key vocals, 'Guns, Babes, Lemonade' was greeted with critical praise, much in part to Muscles' hit single Ice Cream. This awesomely-unique song describes a young, confused Australian caught up in a precarious situation. Not knowing what else to do, Muscles utilizes Ice Cream to mitigate an awkward and potentially dangerous situation. This song will lead to lower tension in awkward situations, likely help you forget any stresses whatsoever, and potentially force you to dance with your shirt off.  (excerpt from my [..])  Best Songs: Ice Cream and Hey Muscles I Love You  1 Line Summation: An extremely unique, amazing and feel-good album that was way ahead of it's time.
0	Do yourself a favor.  Put your headphones on (no not the apple iphone headphones, the good ones)  Close your eyes and press play.  Escape for an hour. Everything about this record is perfect.
0	This song blows my mind!!! Listen with some really good speakers or head phones to get all the layers they put into this. The video on youtube is amazing too!
0	This is music at its best
0	Awesome! Absolutely loved it.
0	Exactly what I wanted!
0	This one was well worth the wait. Another one that scored big at the 5th grade dance. Will recommend to a friend.
0	Read the story first!  Since 1995, I've seen them live 3 times. I will drive a very long way to see this performance. DT fans are active listeners. I've been on this album since the day it was released. It is some of their finest work to date! This gives us all wonderful insight into the minds of the musicians who have brought us so many years of amazing and unique music. John and Jordan have done a fine job with this composition, and I am proud of them and grateful to have had the privilege of being a part of a generation who have been able to enjoy their music.  This is not fast food for the ears. Shorter songs on this album make this easier for newer listeners. I prefer to think of it as one long song.  Go to their site and read the story then listen to the album as you read through the story. If you like the recurring themes like Scenes from a Memory or the 12 step suite, this is right up your alley.
0	Beautiful!
0	Very well on pitch, sensitive performance, will buy more CDs of Elizabeth Watts.  She should be on stage at the Met!
0	After listening to Puscifer/Maynard previous EPs, I was not a huge fan. However, this EP has converted me. I really like every track including the live versions "Momma Sed" and "Vagina Mine." I can't wait for Maynard's next release.
0	Louie Prima and Keely Smith, the kings and queen of the 50's 'Vegas lounge circuit. Included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in "Just One Of Those Things".
0	I purchased music that I liked in order to lmearn how to download music to my smartphone and Kindle Fire.
0	I wanted to give this a higher rating, as I love the song-it really has that Bond feel to it that we all know and love so well. However, the variance in volume is what limited me. It starts out kind of soft, then increases until your ears feel like they will bleed. I love Adele and I love her voice, but I do not appreciate having to adjust my volume control throughout the song. This should have been edited in studio more to control this before its release. Luckily, I didn't pay much for it, so it was worth it, but buyer beware. It is a good number and has that characteristic spy feeling to it, so there is that! ;) The slow background beat that accompanies the Bond experience is present and the overall feeling that danger is right around the corner!
0	fun song
0	This is great and timeless music that triggers some great memories. This is the sound from the past that still has appeal and invariably provokes an attempt to sing along.
0	A long time ago I picked up a Gary McFarland sheet music book at a tag sale.  Since that day I've really enjoyed playing his rich and surprising compositions.  Some of his recordings, on the other hand, left me cold, especially that dang humming thing he did on so many LPs.  Masters has chosen some of McFarland's nicest tunes and addressed them with a highly competent ensemble.  The orchestrations are really nice as are the solos, Smulyan in particular.  I do feel the record (at north of 80 minutes) could be shorter, however.  I found it a lot to try to absorb.
0	always loved this song!
0	Love me some Brittany.
0	A favorite of my mom's who just passed away. Great to hear it again. Thankful she is now touring that city.
0	Wow!  What can I say?  This album is awesome!  The beats are out of this world!!  It is contemporary, traditional and everything in between!  It is another genre defying gift from Israel Houghton.  This creative rendering challenges me to think of others while loving God.  The title track as well as Name of Love, Others and Love Rev really make me want to bless others as part of my worship of God.  Songs like You Hold My World and Hosanna usher me into worship while Mercies and You Won't Let Go help me get my praise on.  Don't hesitate to get this one.  You won't be disappointed!
0	Incredible album.  Hoping for more from him.
0	Great show! Great Music! Love it!!
0	great song!
0	Love thus dong
0	Eric did his thing on this cd, He has live instruments, the songs are a nice mix of today and some throwbacks. I personally could have done without the Eddie Levert track, but that's just me. I'm not a fan of the Ojays (dont' shoot!)and it sounds like something they would have done (a selling point for so many). The cd is a nice blend of ballads and upbeat tempos, I thoroughly enjoyed it and this is my first Eric B. cd. I've liked many of his songs in the past, but not enough to get the entire cd, but 'Sometimes I cry' was the catalyst. Get it now!!!
0	Love love love this song!  Beautiful!
0	Luv luv !
0	I loved this song from Michael Jackson. Truer words have never been said, written, or sung. It had been a while since I have heard it sung and I'm glad I found the download.
0	Great joint, I have the edited version and I cannot stop playing it. This guy is no one hit wonder. From Type of Way and Walk-Thru he cements his presence in rap. Officially a fan.
0	Perfect
0	Nights Are Forever is England Dan & John Ford Coley's biggest album for a big reason... make that two reasons!  "Lady" is a country ballad with a good chorus and a decent laidback verse melody.  "Many highways I've been on since I went chasing a song, and I left you standing alone in the soft morning sunlight.  Now it's summer just like it was then, you were waving goodbye in the wind, and I heard you ask if I intend to ever settle down".  The chorus is more upbeat.  "Lady do you still seek the mysteries of life?  Or have you become some businessman's wife?  And do you still long to be free, lady when you stare up at the stars out in the night, do you still think this old world would turn out right and do you ever think of me?"  The second verse melody is really good lyrically as you can tell!  "The moon lit and danced on your hair, we sat for some time on the stairs, and I'd give anything that we could share those moments again, but I'm surrounded by velvet and gold and strangers who offer their souls, but they all seem so hollow and cold, when I remember you".  Wow, sounds like England Dan & John Ford Coley are fed up with fortune and fame!  "The Prisoner" starts off with an eerie flute solo that reminds me of glancing out at the wilderness many miles away.  This Spanish guitar line comes in.  Too bad it's brief.  The verse melody reminds me very strongly of Seals & Croft's more mystical-sounding acoustic stuff.  "Take us to the prisoner, let us gaze into his eyes to see what kind of man it takes a nation to despise, take us to the prisoner let us look upon his face to see why 20,000 men would gladly take his place".  The melody reminds me of Paul Simon during the line "Won't someone give a drink to him, remove the chains and let him live, let him live".  More lyrics- "Take us to the prisoner let us listen to his voice to see why worlds of wisdoms in a cell without a choice, take us to the prisoner torn and bent beneath the chains, we wonder if the world is really worthy of his name".  The final line is really good too- "Take us to the prisoner with his eyes so full of grace, the priests have lied and kings have died filled with their own disgrace".  These are GREAT lyrics!  "I'll Stay" is a happy ballad, but somewhat forgettable.  "Happy times like pens and dimes, they slip away you turn around they're goooooone one day, but I'll stay" is a VERY soothing line!  "Empty words like winter birds, they leave the next they join the rest then flyyyyy away, but I'll stay".  The song picks up the pace with the next part- "'I'll be there in the morning when you wake up, I'll be by your side, I'll be there in the evening, with your soul in mine, I'll be there in the morning from the moment you begin to rise, I'll be there in the evening, keep you satisfied, satisfii-ii-ied!".  The mellow part returns ("Fairweather friends like temper winds, they roll along they sing their songs, they blooooow away, but I'll stay".  The "But I'll stay" part thrown on at  the end sounds a little forced unless I'm completely crazy about that.  Maybe I am completely crazy!  The lyrics get eerie with the line "One by one they'll all be gone, but everyday and in everyway and for always I'll stay" before ending on a pleasant note with the lyrics "Feeling worn on pages torn, and near the end the ink begins to faaaaade away, but I'll stay I'll stay".  "Westward Wind" has an upbeat and meaningful verse melody that STRONGLY reminds me of Bob Welch (of Fleetwood Mac fame) and a chorus that reminds me of the Eagles early country period.  "Seems I remember her best when the moon is high, and on the horizon she waits where the sea touches the sky, we'll make up for time we've lost and days gone by, and we'll walk the beaches, live the way the island teaches, oooooooh westward wind, filling my sails and giving me time to spend with you again, oooooh westward wind, sail away like a dream coming back again".  How about this next line- it's so touching!  "Soon I will gaze into your eyes of blue, it's been such a long time since I was there with you, we'll think of a hundred things that we can do, when the days are long and nights are filled with smiles and laughter".  "Long Way Home" opens with a really tear-jerking piano line.  The piano picks up a moment later with short bursts of saxophone and orchestration.  The verse melody reminds me of James Taylor a lot, and in particular his "Your Smiling Face" song.  "I guess you're all waiting for the news and how you like my music, so now I'm comin' on home to you, so I climb up on the bus and settle down and start thinking of us, and how you've been behind me all the time".  The chorus is much louder with the lyrics "And if I hadn't tried, I might have died never knowing, and now I'm going back where I belong, it's a loooooong long way back home again I ain't seen her smiling face since I don't know when".  Ha, the words "smiling face!" adding more to the James Taylor sound!  It's gotta be intentional- were you listening to these guys James?  Since "You're Smiling Face" was still 4 years away, he probably was!  "You know I felt so tall when I got the call and they told me you're gonna use my songs like you told me all along, moving down a winding road that goes by fields and telephone poles, and now I'm just dreamin' about someday being a star and all".  I enjoy the "Think I'm goin' home" part at the end- with the orchestration and return of the sax it sounds so devastating!  Well guys, you worked hard writing music and probably toured just as hard, so I think you deserve some time back home!  "Everything's Gonna Be Alright" "Your love's like a rope that ties a ship down to the dock, your love never seems to stop and I've been sailing since you've been here, your love's like a life line that's been thrown to a drowning man, you just held out your hand and you saved me yes, you saved me" is a VERY upbeat lyric.  "And everything's gonna be alright, nothing left but love's in sight, everything's gonna be alright now, everything's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright" is a pretty good chorus too.  Enjoyable piano solo during the chorus- so much fun to dance to this stuff!  The jazziness is light enough to make the song sound just right.  "Your love's like a waterfall that goes flowing soft and free, just look what you've done to me, I was falling, I was falling, your love's like an autumn wind that goes blowin' across the field, your love always seems to build it's getting stronger, it's getting stronger"  "Showboat Gambler" has speedy banjo in the beginning.  Awesome lyrics. "Tonight I'll board the Delta Queen abound for New Orleans, and again I'll get that feeling that I'm free, her paddle wheels will churn and her smoke stacks they will burn, and slowly I'll be carried to the sea".  How nice!  I'd like to take this boat ride myself given those creative lyrics, haha.  "I know every river ship 'cuz I've taken every trip and I know every captain by his name, in the eyes of every man I can tell what's in his hand, I guess that I have played in every game" and "Tonight I'm sitting here beneath a chandelier, there's a lady here to light my big cigar and if luck will be my friend we'll be finished up by ten, and we'll be standing on the decks beneath the stars".  How about the chorus? "Because I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler, I make my living on the run, I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler, Big Muddy will always be my home".  This is a great country tune!  Even the guitar solo in the middle is really memorable.  "There'll Never Be Another For Me" opens with an uplifting guitar line and the verse melody replicates that same uplifting vibe. "There'll never be another for me, there'll never be, never beeeEEEE".  "I can't just live with the changes, walking around here living like strangers, life is supposed to be living we're not giving and it's slipping away".  This melody actually reminds me of Paul McCartney's mid 70's stuff.  "We got to stop all the raving, take a minute and make it worth saving, love is supposed to grow closer but it's moving us over, it'll leave us one day, I been doing my best just to keep hanging on, but it won't work at all if I'm working alone"  "Nights Are Forever Without You" starts with a really dreamy guitar line before the lyrics come in.  It's a mellow line.  "Lying in bed with the radio on, moonlight falls like rain, soft summer nights spent thinking of you, when will I see you again?  Soft and low the music moans, I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you" and after the chorus the memorable line "Curtains still dance with the wind and the sky, the sun will be coming up soon, but I just can't sleep for thinking of you here alone with the moon".  The "I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you" is a tender line... oh what the!  I KNOW this song!  "I didn't know it would be so stro-o-ong, waiting and wondering about you, I didn't know it would last so lo-o-ong, nights are forever without you".  This is a GREAT chorus!  The whole song is awesome too.  "It's Not the Same" opens with memorable lyrics.  "Familiar surroundings, and echoes still sounding from the songs that played, while the island swayed we moved like the ocean with faith and devotion, then our love fell and we both knew well". Love the chorus ("So I started walking with whom I was talking I'll never remember her name, as darkness was falling I'd swear you were calling, I turned but it wasn't the same I almost called out your name, the hours were unending, we seemed to be spending all those precious hours counting stars and flowers, now you're returning, just when I'm learning that we're not a pair, though we both have cared".  Love the chorus once again "(And I was reminded by the times I was blinded, in hopes that you still would be there, recounting our brief love was all I could think of, maybe I'll find it somewhere but at times it all seems so unfair).  Oh is that the end of my review?  Of course not!  Not until I mention "I'd Really Love to See You Tonight!" and how, yes, rather embarrassingly... I *too* thought the lyrics were "I'm not talking 'bout the linen and I don't want to change your mind".  The thought then occurred to me "Why would a popular well-respected band talk about bed linen?"  I tried to rationalize this by convincing myself bed linen was another way of saying England Dan and/or John Ford Coley wanted their girlfriends to spend the night and sleep in bed with either of them, lol.  But bed linen?  Seems like a rather specific choice of words!  I was trying to rationalize a misheard lyric *seriously*, not as a joke,  LOL!  I guess I really was THAT convinced the words "bed linen" were being sung.  Glad this is actually a common misheard lyric so I don't feel so silly now!  Well maybe a little embarrassed.  I also read that England Dan & John Ford Coley are actually aware of this misheard line and mentioned it at a concert once saying something like "And folks just to let you know... we're not talking about bed linen". LOL!  It's just an easy mistake to make- the words "movin' in" are sung with emphasis on the "VIN" part (moVIN' in) so it throws people off.  I just love the line "But there's a warm wind blowin' the stars around, and I'd really love to see you tonight".  How perfectly tender!  Nights Are Forever is a fantastic album and I highly recommend it.
0	I confess that being familiar with the versions of Because the Night by 10,000 Maniacs (around the time I was a teenager) and a version by Cascada (first hearing around 5-6 years ago) indirectly influenced me to listen to this version of Because the Night by Patti Smith Group. The lyrics and music are kind of a vintage classic rock with what sounds to be a blend of adult contemporary soft rock. Nontheless, this version of Because the Night by Patti Smith is perfect to listen to if you are an eclectic music listener andor are familiar with the Because the Night version by 10,000 Maniacs andor Cascada.
0	First boy and the best one of them all. Had the smartest kids to whom, when they got older new it was time to move on to something else. The songs they sung are the best for the boy bands.
0	Excellent!!!
0	I reviewed the version by the La's in another missive and if you are interested you can look for reviews by me and others re that cover.  The Sixpence None The Richer version is to me a better one in that the strong female component to the lead singers gives the song a bit more of a vivacious air about it.  If you must pick one version I would pick this version.  But at these prices picking up both versions is well within reach.
0	5 stars
0	Both soulful and poppy, 'The One, The Only...' strikes a nerve with its mod-pop 60's feel that can sometimes be called reminiscent of The Chiffons with one big difference: Chantal rocks it by herself --and will blow your mind. The vibrant music and amazing vocals can only lend a small hint to what a live show would be like: full of energy and in your face.
0	My wife and listen to this at bedtime, it is so nice drifting off to sleep with God's Word in our mind. We have used this at home meetings to demonstrate Lectio Divina to others, it has been a huge blessing.

0	Jackie Wilson's classical training (which he credited to Billie Ward - probably referring to the head of the 50s group The Dominos that Jackie belonged to - who had studied music at Julliard and did work as a vocal coach) - is brought to bear on on this tune borrowed from Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto - it's an impressive performance that blends opera with pop more successfully than the attempt made 20 years earlier when the melody was used for the pop tune "Tonight We Love"  Jackie is a favorite of mine - and this performance is one of my favorites of his (along with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Higher-Higher/dp/B001A7HBZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Higher & Higher</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Lonely-Teardrops/dp/B004I11RFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lonely Teardrops</a>)
0	If you have foreigners who have knowledge about Japanese idols to some extents, you will have known about Morning Musume or AKB48 that is representative Japanese girls group idols already. But I want that you have more knowledge about Japanese group idols because you have had opportunity that know about J-idols, that is, I wish that you have more deep knowledge, that you go back the history of Japanese-group idols.  On such process, you never can avoid Onyanko Club(85-87). Off course such group idols like Cnadies had existed on 70's already. But on my view-point, and if we talk about the existence mean on today group idol world like AKB48 or morning, I think that we should reflect spotlights to Onyanco rather than old style group idols like Candies.  Onyanko club have unique sounds so that we generally can listen on 80's music scene, digital sounds. on the other hand, the promoting systems on commerce was charmful, that is to say, Onyanko Club was consisted by high-school team over 20 girls, and specially popular members on them debuted as solo singers, singing as onyanco group. Such revolutionary promoting systems was handed AKB48 or Mornign Musume. If we don't point to Onyanco history, we have never the qualification that talk about AKB or Morning. Why I will be able to say such big-mouth? That will be implied the promoting system as I have said already.  For instance, Tsunku who is Morning's total producer spent a hot onyanco club fan on his high school age. He is admitting about that, too, that considered once onyanco club with the promoting systems. in fact, the "graduation" and "enrolling" system are seen on Morning Musume, and "were" seen on Onyanco Club, too.  We can say same thing on AKB48. The solo debut system or unit-group system is just same with Onyanko. AKB's total producer is Yasushi Akimoto. And Onyanko's total producer "was" Yasushi Akimoto, too. He have got victory on 80's group idol scene by Onyanko, but on 90's-00's, his career was not well, though he was challenging to some project like Checkikko and so on. by passing such process, he have rivived on 10's by AKB.  If you want to untie the history of Japanese group idol, and to know the roots, Onyanko will be best!
0	Always biased toward anything sung by Johnny Mathis, but especially this duet with Deniece Williams.
0	This was a gift for my granddaughter and she thought it was great and has enjoyed it for a long time.
0	I ordered this for my husband who is your typical die hard Dylan fan...When he heard it for the first time, he said, 'Are you trying to get me to hate Bob Dylan?'..My reaction to the first listen was laughter- it was just so incongrous to hear Dylan sing some of the classics.. second listen:  I hear my husband singing along to it- he NEVER sings along to any Christmas songs! It is definitely not your typical Christmas album, but he sounds like he's having fun- the merriment is infectious- I also appreciate the fact that money made from this cd is going to a charity- thumbs up from our house!
0	Love this song!
0	Not feeling quite as inventive as some prior albums of theirs.  Very familiar, and in that, fits like a comfortable fleece.  Next album hopefully rocks my world a bit more.
0	Great!
0	Great upbeat version of this timeless Christmas Classic. Fun song for Worship Teams to play at their church Christmas celebration.
0	very nice
0	Different but I liked it. I love the harmonies and extreme talent these vocalists display. For me, it is totally the music because I don't understand the language.
0	Wow. I'm probably one of the biggest fans of 3DD you'll find...But even I have to admit that their recent stuff has been pretty lackluster. The self titled album to me was their pinnacle, but everything has been pretty downhill from there.  Until now. The catchiness is back, the hooks are back, the fun is back. And the production is really top notch on this. A lot of the songs have sort of a punkish teen angst vibe, and I dig it. Even the ballads aren't sappy and don't bring down the tone of the album. Theres a real fun, lighthearted sound on this CD, and it's been sorely missing from 3DD the past years. If 3DD lost you the last couple years, give this a shot. They might just get you back.
0	I like the duets- sound great  together with Barbara
0	This is a great song, I used to listen to it when I was younger. I was listening to my I-Pod the other day and this song by another artist came on, she did a nice job but it doesn't compare to the Dells version. I have this on vinyl and I played it so much it was full of scratches, it's nice to hear it minus the scratches. This brings back memories, a great buy.
0	Great Tune!
0	This is an amazing album, I cannot stop playing it.
0	This song was what we used for our first dance at our wedding and it was so perfect. Such an elegant and beautiful song
0	I have to say that Joe Baker's works tend to be the best and this one may be the best of his.  I have bought several wave/ocean recordings in the hopes of finding one that really relaxes me after a stressful day and helps put me to sleep.  This is it!  Even though I am not a super huge fan of going to the beach, the sounds of these waves is very very nice to listen too - the beach of your dreams, where there are literally no extra noises.  No people, no birds and best of all, no obvious monotony.  I have another wave tape, but after several listens, it sounds like 5 minutes of wave recording just played over and over.  This is not like that at all.  I'd highly recommend this recording.
0	This song is deep. I love the metaphysical side of Blue Oyster Cult and encourage any fans to check out the wikipedia entry on this song. It's kind of a Stephen King novel, if he did sci-fi,  boiled down into six or seven minutes. I love it.
0	I must love this one, I downloaded it twice! oops! Havent listened to it for a while so I thought it was new to me. Not all death metal vocals, some creative tuneage in there as well.
0	So good.  This is a keeper for the ages.
0	I ordered Native Summer and this CD, Taken' It Home at the same time and there was nothing that I saw to tell me that they were the same CD's.  I like Joe Cano's style of playing but I do not need two of the same CD.
0	Once in a lifetime you stumble across a song that you heard and loved as a kid but never knew who the artist was. Nearly forgotten, you accidentally rediscover it and those happy kid feelings are rediscovered as well. I had collected a couple of Traffic albums and a few works by Steven Winwood, but somehow this song escaped me even though I loved listening to it on the radio I never knew the artist was Traffic. Thanks to this missing Gem, I am getting more in touch with a really great band. If you like organ / keyboard rock tunes, you are really going to like this one.
0	Wynton is a legend in my hometown New Orleans, as are his father and brother. Love his mellow horn. This is a cover of Duke Ellington's (I think) original. I am a New Orleans Traditional Jazz fan, but this is also over the top. Lap it up.
0	Perfect and free.....and it's all about GOD!!!!
0	I like 90% of the CD. It includes shaggy however there is one rap song that does not move me since I am not a rap music kinda girl.
0	I stumbled upon this album quite by surprise and I find it amazing that litterally no-one has reviewed it before. It's a beautiful, laidback album containing folk/country/americana songs sung in a smooth barritone voice and accompanied by very skillfull guitar and harmonica playing. And this guy is from Brooklyn NY  ! I have been listening to this record for the past week : highly recommended
0	You Won't Cry to This!
0	Great album Only thing that bothered me was the case was cracked but oh well its just a case haha :P
0	great
0	I don't like most Chicago songs, but I've always loved this one. I bought the 45 when it came out. It's still a great song.
0	Like it a lot. Would have given it 5 stars but not a fan of the slow-Frank Sinatra songs (I think there were two of them). Digging all the fast songs tho. Not at first but after many listens it grew on me. I wish he/they released an album every 6 months!!!
0	I've always been a huge fan of Rick Wright.  To me he -was- Pink Floyd.  He created all of the moods and atmospheres from Arnold Lane through Animals.  My favorite album is Wish You Were Here which was the most keyboard heavy album.  When a little homage to Wish You Were Here, "It's What We Do", came on I felt that one song alone was worth the price of admission.  But wait, there's more.  A lot more and a lot to love.  Sure, you can often tell this came from the same time period as Division Bell, but there is some throw back to the older Pink Floyd, even back to the immediate post-Barrett Floyd.  OK, the long, spacy jams are a lot more restrained here then they were on, say, Echoes, but it's great to hear that type of jam that only Pink Floyd could pull off.  In some ways the sound, with Richard Wright's keyboards creating a backdrop, is closer to the classic Floyd sound I love than anything since Animals.  Ah, bitter sweat to say goodbye, but I think this is a great swan song, rough edges and all.
0	Calming. Like popular bands. I would get down to this song. . . . . . . . . ..
0	without the above two tracks will be four stars,i think Liz is more compatible than Tracy for massive atttack,& fortunately Mezzanine is another big stripe after the masterpiece of "blueline". this is  an album not to be missed not only for trip-hop fans but everyone
0	We played it at a memorial service and OT touched many hearts.  Elton John is awesome and has so much feeling and power in his voice and music.
0	Will put you in the mood !!!
