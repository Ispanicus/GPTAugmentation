0	Heard so many times Lovato has a powerful voice. So I've been trying to find it in every CD she released. Have to say, after listening to "Confident" I finally give up. Because this girl is simply not gifted with such thing . Pretty sure that screaming loud, almost on the verge of voice capabilities,doesn't count so. On this record Demi sounds somewhere in between Katy Perry, Sia and Ellie Goulding. Moslty like Katy Perry, which is not good at all. Maybe Lovato vocal abilities are not that impressive like her fans say, but comparing to awful Perry attempts Demi can stay in tune at least. Guess,  that "Perry" sound is the fault of her music producers who reworked the singer's voice too much, cause I've never heard Lovato sounding like this before . The whole production on "Confident" is pretty much outdated. All that arrangements and music tricks have been used a  million times and in better interpretations. Confident. Womanizer by Britney? Is that you? Overall, except for two songs ("Cool for the Summer" and "Mr Hughes") there are absolutely no catchy tracks. "Confident" is a passage album, missing any sign of originality.  P.S.: in case of Demi Lovato, singing songs like "Confident" (by the way the lyrics for that track are one big cliche) and especially calling the whole album like this, shows even more how insecure she really is. 2 good songs = 2 stars.
0	I was disappointed in this CD.  I thought it would be a copy of his original gospel albums, but it was not.  There were only a few songs on the CD that I liked or even knew.  It appeared to me that someone just threw some songs together and called it "He Touched Me."
0	I've waited years for this compact discs. On the good side: on this disc-set you find the first and best possible performance of the completed Mahler 10 in the 2d Cooke version. Wyn Morris creates an incredible powerful sometimes organlike sound with the NPO while at the same time he is aware of the subtle textures of this difficult modern score. Also on this set is a live mono recording of the Mahler 8 under Eduard Flipse. This is a decent but very ugly sounding performance, only useful as historical document. On the bad side: What went wrong in the refurbishment of the Mahler 10 recording? The vinyl version sounds good but this digitized version sounds shrill in the violins and distorted in the climaxes, the individual movements have different volume levels and you can hear sometimes strange 'clicks' in movements 1 & 5. Sadly a missed opportunity.
0	I was super stoked to buy this because i hadn't listen to them in a long time and was hoping for something great but i listen to it through and couldn't stand any of the songs on the album and tossed it out. thanks for the let down!
0	This has to be the worst album Mary has ever made.  I listened to it 1 time then gave it away.  What a waste of money
0	The sound level was really low on this.  I put it into a play list with other classical pieces and couldn't even hear it.  I tried amplifying it with Audacity and it was overwhelmed with hiss.  I definitely don't recommend it.
0	Two things as immediate disclaimers: 1) I love good theology. 2) I like Shai Linne.  However, this album is by far his weakest. As much I like formula of theology + hip-hop this album feels forced, and in places, rather campy. Maybe I don't get it, and maybe this album isn't for me but trying to capture systematic theology as a discipline, in the art of hip-hop just doesn't work. Lyrics felt forced ("Election").  His song "Fal$e Teacher$" is written for deceived Christians in Africa. but I'm not sure they would be getting his album. In that case it just doesn't seem to fit. The song "Take Up and Read" tries to be clever and creative by taking book titles and authors and presenting them as writers that the Christian should read. Honestly this was the campiest song of the whole album. They chorus sings:  We gotta take up and read Or we will never proceed In growing up into maturity, we oughta take heed In these last days what we need We gotta take up and read And be the People of the Book! Gotta be the People of the Book!  But the list of the books here are not inspired Scripture. Certainly they are good books, but they aren't mandatory for a Christian to read and grow. Discipleship is more than reading books.  I could mention a few other things but I think I'll leave it at this. Shai and I would agree on our theology and I am thankful for his ministry and music. I just didn't think album was a very good representation of systematic theology and hip-hop.  It was a square peg (sys-theo) in a round hole (hip-hop).
0	Bought this because we like God's not dead, and figured it would be similar. We disliked it so much, we gave it away
0	ChaCha question and answer puts it in the  "Pop" category.  Definitely not a lazy tune.  Pretty up and peppy.  Articulated words are present which is excellent.  ."if I could just crash here tonight?". cool lyrics.
0	I didn't like a single track from the album.

0	I was looking for music by Beethoven. Instead I have small snippets of his music featuring different interpretations of the snippet. And some of these are only a few notes long.
0	As a DJ and audiophile, I can't stand when digital music download sites don't offer a lossless option. I don't mind paying more for ABSOLUTE CD QUALITY! A physical copy of this album is incredibly rare, and that being the case, I want my copy to be EXACTLY what I hear on the cd with no compression or data loss.
0	Woodland sound and bad new age music meditation CD. No vocals at all. No Pranayama instruction. You won't learn anything from this one.
0	when kurt and Donnie left it wasn't the guess who no more .the lp itself wasn't the best work theyb did but considering let a rebuilding band of sorts tho dominic helped finsh road food lp flavours to me was a bust I sedom listen to it .power in the music was a tad better still after power in music guess burton had enough since bill was gonna leave so. my opion stay away from this lp buy power in the music reisure it nice.
0	The four letter words were terrible, ruined the whole song for me. I bought the wrong version.
0	I really want to love this song, but the vulgar and immoral rap solo near the end just ruins it for me. If Amazon could somehow acquire a clean edited version of the song, I would absolutely love that. :)
0	In my opinion, this cd (disappointed).  Minus only 3 or 4 songs, All Killer No Filler isn't worth my 15 dollars.  The only good songs are "In Too Deep" "Never Wake Up" "Heart Attack" and perhaps "Fat Lip".  These are the only songs that are worth anything at all, don't buy it.  The songs i mentioned above are good, because they have some good lyrics and a good sound, but there is alot of repeition of badness on the cd.  There's a track that is practically the same as "Fat Lip", change a couple words and some chords.  I think it's track 10, and this song is only better than the rest of the (stuff) on the cd.  You'd be better off downloading the few songs then wasting the (money) on Sum 41.  Use it to buy yourself a clue if you even want to buy the cd.
0	If Kate Smith is singing on this cut, I don't hear her. I like Kate Smith a lot - this cut is an ensemble, and nondescript at that. Pablum.
0	It sucks , sounds like they are in a hurry to get a album ouy
0	this wasn't what I expected - thought it would be soothing music not an annoying droning voice.  It does teach you a relaxation technique but it didn't work for me.
0	never got this. ok i don't know why . never heard from them . please get in touch with me .
0	I don't know what program is being used to convert this song to mp3 format, but it is not of good quality. The song is overmodulated to the point of distortion. Just be aware that it's not a crystal clear copy.
0	First of all lets correct the misinformation here Keith was not a one hit wonder after 98.6 he came back even stronger with Ain't Gonna Lie which went higher on the charts,second K-tel in the 70,s was a wonderful company who presented only original hits and I do mean original but with the advent of cd,s K-tel no longer could get the rights to release the original songs on cd so they went and got the original artists to redo the songs,this is a poor way to try and get more money from the customer by shamming them into believing these are the originals and they put in very very very small print redone by the original artists,get the original hits on Amazon there not that much more and you,ll be three times as pleased. Shame on you K-tel you were once the leadre in compilations by original artists and now this is how far you have fallen.
0	I agree with the negative reviews for this CD. This recent CD is horrible coming from such a great artist as James. James has tarnished his good reputation by putting this gargage out to probably fulful his contractual obligation to the record company. And only ten songs when a CD can hold around 18 songs is just plain greedy. I am a huge fan of Taylor's songs from the early days but these seem really forced and just plain bad. It is a greedy money grab and takes advantage of his built-in fanbase, knowing that they will blindly buy anythnig he puts out. I don't understand the other glowing reviews on here. Be honest, when compared to Only a Dream in Rio and other great earlier songs this is nowhere near that quality. So glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't actually spend any money on it. Sorry JT fans, this guy is done!
0	I no longer even own a CD player. I use my computer for playback. This box set is copy-protected so that it will not play in my Mac, and therefore is defective. I waited too late to find this out so can't return it, but will never again keep any CD that can't be played in a computer. I don't pirate music, but I need to be able to play it.
0	This track is by Glenn Stafford. It is well known is the intro music for Blizzard North's Diablo 1, released back in 1996. Glenn Stafford worked with Matt Uelmen on all of Diablo's audio; Stafford specifically in charge of composing the cinematic music.
0	Ever heard the progressive rock stylings of Buffalo Tom? Now THERE'S some music you can groove to. Nirvana wasn't even half as good. When I was first getting into music and becoming my own person, I saw My So-Called Life and heard about them. I bought their debut, and was so happy that I didn't waste it on Kurt Cobain's cries for pity backed to squealing guitars. Nirvana was a horrible live band, so I personally think they were horrible period. Their pricey studio trickery they used to cover up their imperfections on Nevermind proves how cold and calculating "Kurdt" was. "Artist" my ass. If he really wanted an honest album, he could've re-recorded the songs for the album in his basement, and then sent THAT to Geffen. After all, Kurt had total creative control over everything Geffen got, so he could've changed it if he honestly wanted to. But, of course he didn't. He was lazy, left Nevermind the glossy way it was, and then watched as Sam Goodys everywhere stocked it for way much more than it was worth. Sure, he loved cassettes and vinyl, but when he saw fans having to spend over 15 bucks per CD, he didn't give a sh*t about his fans. After all, at least it wasn't HIM having to scrounge up that money. He was a famous heroin rock star now. Want a real taste of what Nirvana was? Then go out to Sam Goody's and plunk down nearly 20 bucks for Muddy Banks, and then have a good cry. I guarantee you WILL shed tears after having wasted that much money on such a disaster of a set of live performances.  Rest In Peace, Ray Charles Rest In Hell, Kurt Cobain
0	This is supposed to be an accompaniment track (no voices).  However, it's the original song.  I previously purchased the original, and was looking for the version without voices for a memorial DVD.  Ended up with an adequate version from another company (Christian Rock, the Best of. . .).
0	This is a great album but the record quality is terrible
0	Not my favorite band but wanted the album for a flashback. Good seller though
0	This album was boring. As a long time JT fan it seemed uninspired like many of his more recent efforts.
0	Although I love Cleo Laine's voice and the songs on this album, I was disappointed to hear that all were in the same slow tempo, resulting in a rather monotonous listening session.
0	I heard from Joe DeRosa from a friend who's into the LA comedy scene. I gave Joe a shot and I must say I wish I hadn't. First of all, he is not funny. Second of all, his jokes are very sexist and mysogynist. He comes across as a woman hater in his jokes. Apart from not benign funny, he lacks charisma and talent. I had the displeasure of listening to this garbage in its entirety for the sole purpose to give it an honest review. Joe, please quit comedy and work at a Walmart as a greeter cause you have the charisma of a mannequin.
0	tell me you didn't put out this bs, main!  tell me you jus jokin main!  tell me you ain't sirus main!  i thought you wuz my biggest investor main!  this is what happens when people mistakenly believe that success in one area automatically translates into success in another.  and are not surrounded by people who don't keep them grounded w/ the truth ("You are not as profound as you think you are.")  this is what i hear on sanctuary:  livin on casanova was liftin, didn't know i was driftin you, oh, but you, wanted me, . . . its all right its okay, . . . ha, ha, ha, ha.  huh?  truth be told, w/ slight exception of H & F, he is basically the same character in each film.
0	This cd is a waste of time. Forget about this pathetic band, and spend your money on something better
0	has a baby crying the first 15 seconds of the song. understandably this in the singers child but still it ruins the song and makes me skip it on my play list
0	Rihanna is very filthy to have named her song this. Its a shame that she has to lower herself like this.  I hated how the name of this song just slaps me in the face like this without any warning. Its a disgrace that song titles can get away with such sexist language. So if the name of the song had the homophobic f word, would that be acceptable?
0	Could not get Amazon Cloud player to work after downloading their 'Amazon mp3 Downloader'. paid $5 and no mp3s. Obviously nothing is wrong with the product so much as the system.
0	The big mystery is what happened to I'm On Fire! I heard the song on Pandora and bought the album looking for the song. Carol does a great job on it, but it's not on the album. Major WTF!
0	I didn't order this, no clue how it shows up on my "write a review".
0	I chose the wrong song, and can't figure out how to get the right one.
0	Didnt have eight counts with current or well known music
0	It is absolutely so sad that Beyonce' Knowles has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record, and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a songstress whom has been more of a stunt, than just letting her voice speak for itself. It is sad, because she has not been making really good songs, but borrowing the same stunts and overexposure hat artists like Michael Jackson and the recently deceased Prince have had for years. But they have really had some excellent songs that have stood the test of time. Unfortunately, Beyonce has not been able to do that. When I first heard her song Formation a few months ago, I honestly would have to say that I really was dearly unimpressed with where her music was going. It fell flat like the soul passing on. I really found this song to be her worst dance anthem since Partition. She really put out all they hype for # Lemonade, for nothing but a sour lemon. This should go into the same place Rihanna's Work has been, tired and worn out.  Song: D 1/2-
0	I was searching for some more christmas music to add to my collection each year I want somethjng to play other than our Chipmunks christmas and Soulful Christmas albums. So this works. Thanks for the free music, free is always good, so no complaints.
0	Vulgar language in song writing is just laziness and lack of talent.
0	Vintage, but a little too beyond my era of music.  It wasn't distasteful. just not the genre of music I like.
0	Bought this for my kids. absolutely no point because it sounds awful. Wish I could get my money back now for sure.
0	Disappointing for Zombie. Maybe one original sounding, decent tune. 3 one and a half minute instrumental bits (dull).
0	The album is getting credit for selling alot of records but Wayne is a mid level artist at best. This album is straight GARBAGE with little kid songs like Lollipop. come on he has no skills. I look at Wayne and see a disappointment, he is addicted to drugs and has big issues. Yes the album sold records but is there any substance will anyone remember this album 5 years from now? HELL NO is the answer. Its not a classic like Illmatic or like Reasonable Doubt or Ready to Die or The Marshall Mathers LP or The Chronic I mean lets be real people if Wayne drops when any big name drops he sells maybe 200,000 copies. To say he is the greatest ever is a travisty and a disgrace it just goes to show you who listens to Hip Hop today. Wayns lyrical skills are weak at best and jay Z burns him and runs circles around him on his own album. Sorry Wayne i was expecting more and all I got was a sub-par album that was highly OVERRATTED and OVERHYPED. Stick to remixes your better on other peoples songs anyway. 1 star is all this album deserves please review the track list before wasting your money.
0	Wouldnt play in some of my electronics. Can i return for a replacement?
0	Ok, but not what I expected it to be.
0	Although there is not much information about the product, reviews lead you to believe that it is the original movie soundtrack which includes some dialog from the movie. It claims to be exactly like the original vinyl record. Well. it is not. Reviews claiming that it is are false and miss guiding The sound quality also leaves much to desire.
0	Download only played a few seconds of the song.  Was for use in a parade of lights.  Ended up having to go to youtube and play it live off of a you tube video instead of using a download I paid for.
0	Let me just clarify. I love it but these are updated somewhat changed versions of the originals. They are good but the original versions of alot of these awesome jams are alot better than the ones on this compilation.
0	Madonna's "Who's That Girl" sets a much faster pace than her "La Isla Bonita" which goes at a slow pace.  The song is marked by spanish motifs and words, obviously her favorite culture.  This song makes me feel good to be a girl.  This song has intrinsic value in my life.
0	Song was less than a minute. Looks like a sample that somehow was put up for sale. Ended up buying the album
0	Does not sound like the music and style of Waylon
0	The beginning of the song is annoying and did not expect that. Just wanted the song :/
0	The seller's reponse to those who have questions about the representations made for this CD:  "Seller Response: "Read the description. "These recordings were taken from the only known acetate record of the tapes, that were aquired some time ago. They are as they were recorded on Jan. 1, 1962."  Date: June 21, 2009  Actually, as another reviewer noted, Joe Pope offered these for sale during the 1970s-1980s as singles.  He also offered them as an LP, which, having heard it, I noted was pristine in sound: no scratches, no pops, or other defects.  Apparently Joe Pope had a second "only known acetate record of the tapes," except that his was pristine.  Otherwise, to clarify as concerns the actual facts:  1.  The audition was with Decca Records, not EMI.  The producer there had the option of choosing one "guitar group," and the other auditioned was "Brian Poole and the Tremeloes".  He chose the latter over "The Beatles" because they were in London, which was a convenience for the label, whereas "The Beatles" had yet to relocate from Liverpool to London.  2.  The audition was not taped; it was recorded direct-to-disk.  (See All You Need is Ears, by George Martin.)  3.  As Decca Records still exists, or is part of the MCA group, it is not likely the sold these valuable recordings to EMI or anyone else.  It is most probable that they contracted with EMI for use of some of them for the "Anthology" project, as they knew they would make a sizable profit from it.  It is one thing to make money from bootlegs - keeping all 100 per cent of it for oneself - but quite another to misrepresent, whether by commission or omission, the nature and quality of them in order to sell them.
0	Mark Knopfler, is a talented artist with a very appealing voice and a virtuoso on guitar, but many of the songs on this double item need some serious refining in the lyrics department. A prime example is "I Used to Could". The song starts out well, but needs more verses, and the last line ala Big Bad Wolfe/Little Red Riding Hood is pure tripe. The whole album could have been great if given a bit more effort and refinement. As it is, I'm sorry I purchased it.  Apart from that, the jewel case on this CD is an abomination. A major PITA to free the discs from an inner unattached piece of plastic.
0	This is a wonderful song . 5 stars for the song! But a very quiet recording doesn't play well on my devices or through additional speakers. Quality not so good
0	I heard nothing compelling on the samples, so I didn't download anything. I would rather sit quietly in my garage than listen to this garage and garbage montage. Another reviewer noted that Indy sets such as this have a tendency to contain Dylanesque wannabees. Well, you don't need a weatherman to know the way this set blows.
0	I'm sorry, I have been a huge Heart fan since their inception.  This is not the Heart music I love. It is Ben Menk's album with Ann and Nancy singing.  It sounds as if every song was written on a drum machine.  It has a very techno sound and grungy guitar on it.  No guitar solos.  I love you Ann and Nancy, but get away from Ben Menk and take your touring band into the studio for the next album.  You should not be playing second fiddle to Ben Menk.
0	I bought the bluray package for the videos, they were b&w recording session, junk, complete waste of my money.
0	Cool but weird. a little i.c.p. feel with black roots
0	Terrible funeral dirge like, wish I had not purchased this one and would like it removed from my cloud partition.
0	Don't waste your time if you expect singers to be able to sing!  And did you ever notice that EVERY one of these samplers has at least one song on it where the guy thinks he is Bob Dylan (but isn't!). Enough already! I suddenly feel inspired to write music. because the market apperas to be WIDE OPEN and waiting for talent. and the musical guests on Saturday Night Live and every other late talk show seem confirm that theory. [.]The mid 90's were great.
0	Alanis Morisette's first album, "Jagged Little Pill", was the zenith for affected, bitter female ranters.  It was one of the few albums where it was radio-worthy in spite of itself - the more obtuse the analogies were, the more intriguing a listen it became. Now, was "Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie" a misstep?  Perhaps from a commercial sense, but as an album it's surprisingly good - a mature collection of songs written from a place of self-awareness without being over the top.  And it took some chances musically that should've been applauded instead of reviled. Morisette's third effort, "Under Rug Swept", seems like an attempt to reconcile the commercial success of the first album with the creative growth illustrated in the second.  Unfortunately, it spends way too much time sounding like "Jagged Little Pill 2 - The Sequel" than an album onto itself.  Tracks like "Hands Clean", "Flinch" and "That Particular Time" sound like outtakes from her first album, to the point that "Hands Clean" goes over territory written about better in "Right Through You." When the album is accessible ("Precious Illusions", "21 Things I Want In A Lover") it really goes no further than being radio-friendly alt-pop.  And when it's not, as in the ridiculous "Utopia", it's pretty much intolerable. "Under Rug Swept" seems like a compromise album written by someone under pressure from her record company to produce hits while not compromising artistic integrity.  Sadly, it appears she does neither in this case.
0	did not receive 2 discs. only 1 and the cover was turned inside out. poor quality control standards.
0	This cd was poor quality and I could not send it back fast enough.  It skipped and had blank spots.  It was an import. I did get my money back with no hassle.
0	If you're being honest with yourself this album is not very good.  I'm as die hard as they come and it pains me to listen to these songs.  I will have to wait two years now to see them live just so these songs get lost in the deck.  Do yourself a favor and buy the new Lumineers album instead.  Every song on that album is great.  Avett Brothers should still be respected as a great band and I must shower now because I feel bad writing this review.
0	I was looking forward to this album but unfortunately the lyrics on the album are very, well, boring and uninteresting "I've got a car, I've got a big black shiny car" Not a great opening for a cd in my opinion Alot won't agree with me this album really isn't worth the money, same with Guy's album. Spend your money on cold chisel or living
0	After carefully listening to the tracks on this new Dylan Album, I suggest a new title, "Fallen Vocal Cords."
0	Waiting for this to be released as a single song somewhere.  No way am I buying the whole album just for one song.  I actually like the song less after I see how they've set this up!  Bad move.
0	the ring tone doesn't play well on my phone. Perhaps a higher gain in the recording so it doesn't cut out when playing.
0	While I agree with the reviewer who criticized the album for its short length, I dislike this album primarily because of the selections. In her liftetime, Nina Simone recorded many blues songs, only a mediocre handful of which are represented here. However, there are a few gems, such as "I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl" and 'House of the Rising Sun" and "Do I Move You?." Only buy if you can get it for under 5 dollars.
0	I thought I was a Lucinda Wlliams fan. Loved Essence, Car Wheels, Happy Woman. Saw the reviews of this and couldn't wait. Got it, played it, really don't like it. Two discs of mumbled dirge. I can't imagine that I can make myself listen to it again. Obviously many others like it. Not me. Tried to give it away - unsuccessfully.
0	The synth-pop continues. I like Greg Kurstin's work with The Bird and The Bee but he is the goto guy to produce number 1 ablums- which doesn't mean it's good musically. If you like T&S stuff prior to Heartthrob prepare for extreme disappointment. At least this makes Heartthrob look not quite as bad. It is one long synthpoop track.
0	I can't get my purchase into my iTunes library. Frustrated.
0	I plan on going to Ozzfest this year, despite the unusually lackluster lineup (I'm really only going to see In Flames, Mastodon, Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Mudvayne, Maiden, and of course Sabbath), so I've been trying to get into more bands that are on this year's tour. I've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork (this was before this particular album's release), and I knew they were (supposedly) melodic death metal, and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I've give them a shot, but I waited for the release of this album, which I had seen advertised, before I actually purchased anything, as I wanted to get this first. That worked with Dark Tranquillity ("Character" is a jaw-dropping album), but maybe I should've started with an older release with Soilwork.  After all the rave reviews I've seen of their past albums, and simply their label of melodic death, I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album. I really didn't get it. While I'm not saying that Soilwork doesn't have talent, I'm just saying that if they do have it, they're not showing it as much as they should be on this record. The songwriting is bland as can be, like a pop rock record: most, if not all, of the songs are in intro riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus formula (with a few exceptions), and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired, not at all melodic death-like. Well, at this point I realize Soilwork, at least on this record, isn't really a melodic death band anymore. While In Flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago, I still believe that they make great, though less complicated and though-provoking, music, "Soundtrack to Your Escape" being one of my favorite albums of 2004. But it just doesn't work with Soilwork. I honestly can't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else. Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice, but it bores me, it just seems too much like something you'd hear on a commercial radio rock album. And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal, but Speed's voice really just doesn't do anything for me. He sings on the majority of the album, but he'll also scream every now and then, but I don't see anything special in that either.  The main problem with this album is it's just too predictable, too dull, too uninspired, too generic, and way too simple. The album has some catchy tracks (the choruses to "Weapon of Vanity" and "Nerve" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them), they just don't stand out too much. If you're gonna be a metal band, you gotta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you've got, and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with, you've really gotta give it all you got. Maybe I'm just judging too hard, but I've given this album time to see if it grew on me, and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it. But since I've heard so many good things about their past releases, I'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future, because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the `Fest.
0	i cannot get the song to download. even if i put in my email 100 times,. that will not make this song download.it is not in any programs in my computer. i want a refund!
0	Stolen tracks, poor composition, not worth the money.
0	I've always loved Brian McKnight's music.  From "Back at One" to "Still the One" to "One Last Cry" and "Anytime". loved em all.  If you're hoping for anything remotely like those, you'll wish you hadn't spent the money.  It's such a shame that I have to not recommend this album, but it just doesn't shine.  I sense that he feels like he needs to get back to "his roots" by going more soulful, more slow hip-hoppy.  And while he succeeds on those points, it's just not gonna produce a top 10 single on regular top 40 radio.  It sorta reminds me of later efforts from Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston where they stopped delivering the kinds of music their fans wanted and instead did their own thing.  What a shame, and what a letdown.
0	I became a huge fan of Jewel when her first cd "Pieces of You" came out. I was so amazed by her pure and poetic lyrics and actual MUSICAL talent. I thought to myself wow Jewel sounds like another Joni Mitchell or Joan Baez. A strong female artist who would never exploit her body or become just another pop star. The old Jewel was someone everyone, including myself, could admire. And then "0304" came out. I knew just by looking at the cover that this was not the same Jewel that I had admired before, with the hot pink pants, and halter top, I had to do a double take to make sure the cd said Jewel and not Britney Spears. I borrowed the cd from a friend just to see what the promise of more $money$ and more MTV airtime could do to such a talented artist and poet. What is the difference between this "cd" and Jewel's first, second, or even third cd you ask? well let's just make a little comparison: Here is a sample of a lyric from Jewel's "Pieces of You." cd- the song "Little Sister"- ."we gotta start feeding our souls have been lost to the millions with lots who feed on addiction selling pills and what's hot and I wish I could save her from all their delusions." And a lyric from "0304" the song "Intuition"- (you know the video where she gets sprayed with the fire hose in the bikini) ."They say Miss J's big butt is boss, Kate Moss can't find a job." I can almost understand why Jewel would make a drastic change, with pop stars making so much money and getting "awards" like "best album" and "best new artist" but I really hope that all the money and new teeny bopper audience that she will get with her new look will make her forget about the time when she really was a true musician and back when I could say I was a fan.
0	Not that bad of a tribute CD, but as for myself, I'd REALLY prefer to listen to the actual Floyd lp. 'The Moon Revisited' is basically nine different unknown artists that cover one track each of the famed 'Dark Side Of the Moon' album. If you're a major, and I do mean MAJOR Floyd nut, you may get more out of this CD than I did. The track "The Great Gig In The Sky" about had me nearly crying for mercy, the woman vocalist just goes on and on. to put it another way, 'The Moon Revisited' is like a Pink Floyd cover band. Tunes like "Speak To Me", "Brain Damage" and "Eclipse" are okay, at best.
0	don't get this album. seriously ppl.  go get Taking Back Sunday
0	Im not sure why I bought this album, but it is not the type of music that I like. I'm sure if you like this kind of music then this is a great album, just not my taste.
0	The song itself is not bad. Just not what I wanted. I had thought I was downloading the actual first version of the song.
0	This is a terrific song, but the MP3 track on the Amazon server has a flaw in it.  Do not purchase or download until Amazon fixes it.  I had to go to the iTunes store to get an undamaged track.
0	First let me say that I love the Counting Crows original work.  Their first two albums are absolutely brilliant.  Now let me talk about how I feel about this one.  It just seems like a rambling of words.  In fact, I don't understand why everyone is rating this one so highly.  A lot of the melodies sound very similar.  A lot of the song are way too long at over 5 minutes a piece.  The only song I really seem to like is "Scarecrow."  This rest are just so-so.
0	Where are gone the beautiful ballads, acoustic guitarsand all the rest that made Jewel's music so good. This new CD only seems to be a try to get teenagers interested in her music. She has been a victim of Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears influence. ( pink trousers on the photo to proove it! ) I only hope this CD won't sell and that she will realise that she has done the wrong thing and is letting her fans down! We still like you a bit Jewel but change your clothes( and your sound ).
0	Never recieved. Got lost in the cloud. I did not understand the download between my computer and the cloud. I do not want to sign an agreement for the cloud wherein I will end up paying. So I chose download and it got lost. maybe it is up in the clouds I do not know. Hesitant to buy any others.
0	I haven't actually purchased this CD. And I won't. But I have listened to the tracks, so here's my review. There's this trend amongst some of my favorite bands where they decide to venture off and try new territory. The problem is that the old territory worked great, and they tend to lose their way. TRAPT were at their best with "Someone In Control". They've not only abandoned familiar territory, but they've started courting 'Adult Contemporary' territory. That's good territory if that's your intended audience. But there are fans who have hung around, clinging to hope that once Chris and the guys got this out of their system, they'd come back with material like what they delivered with "Someone In Control". And TRAPT has had a few of those types of songs here & there on various albums, just not consistently. "Not So Different" was about as rocking as this CD gets.  I really do understand that variety is the spice of life. I had high hopes for "DNA". I may be overly critical, but I refuse to spend $10 for music that just doesn't turn my ears on.
0	This was a waste of money. All 3 of our kids do not like this volume. The songs sound very similar and there really isn't anything fun about it. It is obvious that adjustments have been made for the new Marina and it just doesn't sound good.
0	Good band but not much of an album from someone I've cherished for years
0	All it is, is kids singing to songs that suck! As if the songs weren't already bad enough! There's really nothing else for me to say but recommending the following bands:  Strapping Young Lad  Suffocation  Slayer  Lacuna Coil  Metallica(Even the new stuff is better than this crap!)  Death  Death Angel(no, they're 2 different bands)  I'm done here.
0	Pure s* ok for today's rap but s* compared to Dr Dre's classic lp's
0	If you are looking for a benchmark in absolutely pointless noodling, this could well be it. Sure these guys are fleetfingered fretboard wizards, but music it ain't. Up and down the neck without  a single memorable melodie being created in the process. Every scale known to man is recycled without any apparent reason. The production is . YUK ! Totaly cliche and completely boring. Like a couple of guys practicing in the garage. POINTLESS !
0	As a movie soundtrack fan, I will not download this album though I'm really dying to own it.  why?  because MP3 does not do justice to music in general, orchestral music in particular. MP3 compression damages the sound quality, in the high and low register, minimizes sound depths and reduces reverb and all sort of details that make the music feel more lively.  I won't pay for MP3 quality music which anyway costs nearly the same as a physical CD.  and too bad I won't be able to own this score but I don't want to give in to that Disney statement that physical CDs are not commercially viable nomore. After all, I suppose the main costs of a CD is not the CD itself, but the production of the music itself.  and since the production cost incurred to the movie production budget anyway, why couldn't Disney release a limited number of factory-produced CDs for fans? (who, as I understand from the other comments, are many!)
0	This Album Belongs In The Trash Can! He Used To Have Skills Before He Got Shot. Power of The Dollar Was A Great Album! It's Waaaaaaaay Better Than ANYTHING G-Unit Or 50 Will Put Out In The Near Future. 50 Dissed Ja For Singing. When He Does The Same Exact Thing!. He Raps About Being Gangsta. When He Releases Candy Shop! He Just Keeps On Dissing Everyone Who Does A Song With HIS Enemy. He Dissed Fat Joe And Jadakiss Just For Doing A Song With Ja Rule! And How Can 50 Talk About Running New York? Last Time I Checked, Wu-Tang Ran New York! I Can't Wait Till 50 & G-Unit Are Out of The Industry Forever. They've Ruined Rap! It's Official! It's True! And I Heard Puffy Has A Posthumous Biggie Album Comin' Out Soon. And If Eminem Produces It And G-Unit Is On It Making Biggie Say 'G-G-G-G-Unit!', Puffy Needs A Home. And That Home Is. The Mental Hospital!  DON'T SUPPORT G-UNIT!
0	I had to search deep to find the right version you hear on radio and in stadiums. It's "Doing It To Death by Fred Wesley & The J.B.'s". Look for that version on Amazon.
0	This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes. The problem here, aside the cheesiness that I personally perceived, is that the three African songs (1, 2, & 4 singed in African dialect and in French) are totally uneventful, bland, uninspiring, linear, unvaried, monotonous and TOTALLY POINTLESS!. There is NOTHING happening!. Laba Sosseh is often too busy chit-chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising, and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid-back "Tropical beach" feel with a little Electric-guitar and some trap-drums in the background which get on my nerves!.  The 1st song doesn't even offer a single chorus or a single musician's solo!. It features Laba Sosseh telling us in the middle of "a sexual fantasy" that Ngombelle is a traditional African style of dance that other countries in Africa also love to dance to, and encourages them to dance it even further!.  Song. 2 features a chorus as LONG, as ANNOYING and as INSIPID as: "in coc, in coc, in coc de ba saaah, de ba saaah, de ba saaah" ALL THE WAY THROUGH TILL THE END!. Other than that, we get Laba Sosseh inviting the people of Martinique, Curacao, Ivory Coast and Sngal to come and dance to the Coconut (whatever that means!) and to come and drink fresh Coconut juice with him on the beach! He even makes the impression he's on the phone speaking to the people of Niamey in Niger to invite them for a fresh Coconut juice too!.  (While Latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth, this is REALLY as BAD as it gets.)  For song. 4, I have nothing else to say other than a Trumpet solo by Alfredo Armenteros "Chocolate" towards the end which isn't helped by the background musicality, but which STILL comes out pretty well coming from him.  The reason why I decided to review this recording (now that it has been available under MP3 Downloads since the 5th of August 2008) is to tell you to download the GREAT 3. Maracaibo Oriental, the NICE 6. Pelta (written by Miguel Matamros) and maybe Song. 5 Anichayi which ain't gonna change your world, but which is decent enough not to be skipped (or bought for just $0.89 on MP3 Downloads.)  Even though this label was mainly run by African associates (as Pianist Alfredo Valds Jr. explained on his FASCINATING interview: "The Son of Buena Vista" in descarga's Journal Archives section [.]) I STILL think that they SHOULD have come up with a MUCH BETTER African music project that showcases the music PROPERLY, or with a classic Cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician's SPECIALITY! I would say each to their own thing!.  Therefore, the point is not to discredit African music BY ANY MEANS because it's NOT what I want to do and I DO NOT have the competences/knowledge to do it! I just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are APPALLING examples of what African music should be!  Finally, there would have been one more Laba Sosseh recording on SAR in 1982, and while I haven't heard it properly I can still tell that it's a better album than this one! There's definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isn't one track that gets near Maracaibo Oriental, overall the album does show better with a BIG hit: Diamoul Maw, 2 ROCK-SOLID Cuban tunes which also happen to be songs. 3 and 6, and apparently another hit being song. 5 Aminata. I wouldn't DARE risking recommend it to you all, but check it out anyway&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Laba-Sosseh/dp/B001ESGX6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Laba Sosseh</a>.  Song. 3 Maracaibo Oriental is literally a BRILLIANT Montno-Descrga tune! It features a BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED Piano Montno pattern by Alfredo Valds Jr. that works TO PERFECTION with this AMAZING tune TILL THE END!. There's also a SUPERB introductory Trumpet solo by Cuban GREAT Alfredo Armenteros "Chocolate", OUTSTANDING choruses by Roberto Torres and Adalberto Santiago, AMAZING 2-Trumpets/1-Trombone horn arrangements, a POWERFUL and SOLID Trombone solo by Leopoldo Pineda and some more Trumpet playing towards the end by "Chocolate" accompanying the final horn arrangements!.  EVERYTHING works TO PERFECTION on this tune and EVERYONE is REALLY "at home" and "in their own thing" here!.  [*Descrga in Latin music terms means Jam-Session.]  Song. 6 Pelta (most probably written by Miguel for his Conjnto Matamros) is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk. Otherwise, the tune is VERY PLEASANT, fairly laid back with a set of SOLID horn arrangements, a Tres-guitar solo in the middle by Victor Tras "El Chino" and some FINE Trumpet playing by "Chocolate" towards the end. The FINE chorus keeps singing throughout the tune "pelta!" [meaning jerk in Spanish slang].  Basically, a SIMPLE and GREAT tune!.  For Song. 5 (which is a decent enough Son-Montno tune), I'll let you lot take the punt.  Sound Quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine, BUT NOT BETTER than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake AGES AGO, and which I HAPPILY transferred onto a Cd through a friend JUST for those 2 songs!. My friend didn't disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long, lacked melody and were unexciting too.
0	have been unsuccessful downloading it both wifi or network. have tried multiple times each time it gives me a msg that it was have trouble downloading packets
0	its a waist of money. the entire dvd and cd sounds like church music except for the last song and its the only song with words.
0	I was unable to download this MP3 without downloading software I don't want (Amazon's music player). I already have a music player, and it works fine. I just wanted a favorite tie song.
0	I love Willie Nelson, and all of his songs. With this album, for some reason, I can't get any volume. It just doesn't seem to want to volume up.
0	I had this on tape (yes, I'm old) and I wanted the tracks in "high def". So I bought the CD advertized as new "factory sealed", and the seller sent me a used CD, scratched with the liner notes bent up and cracks in the CD case.  Aside from the actual product I received, this is a good soundtrack. I love the Juliette Lewis "Born Bad" track. But a lot of the songs do have soundtrack dialogue over the song, like L7 "S* List" and the Cowboy Junkies great cover of "Sweet Jane".
0	I seriously bought this entire album for ONE song, "Cowgirl" by Underworld.  I tried to find this song everywhere for legal DL, so in desperation, I spent $10 on a single track.  The most I've paid for one song EVER.
0	while i do love this concerto, and i think benny goodman to be an excellent clarinetist. especially on the copeland concerto, i prefer other interpretations of this piece.
0	Some songs were not the original sound track. Had I known a head of time, I would not have purchased it.
0	The title says it all.  Back in the High Life and Roll with It were vastly superior recordings with far better music.
0	I did not really like this and cannot recommend it.  I'm not a huge fan of this type of music, but I do like it somewhat, esp. songs like Ave Maria.  How could anyone do that one really bad.  It's a great song.  So I liked the style and the songs for the most part, but it was not well done. I was thinking, maybe it's not supposed to be, like your Uncle George singing at your wedding.  I think some of it was kind of sad it was so "roughly," done, because I can accept it and rejoice when my Uncle sings.  He doesn't have to be a pro.  But, I would never purchase this, and that's about it.
0	Song did not download to my device. If possible, I would like my money back.  This is the first time i've had a problem.
0	Mainstream rap is so terrible! It's like listening to a real hip hop artist that got kicked in the head repeatedly. Just sad. The beats aren't even good anymore. Rap died in '96,  go indie, HEAD UNDERGROUND!
0	I JUST downloaded this song for my wedding ceremony.  The song itself is beautiful, but the quality is poor because of the glitches.  On a day as important as your wedding, you definitely want a better quality download!
0	not liking this one. pretty much not on par with what i am used to from him, but maybe after a few more lsitens you'll get there.
0	i thought this was supposed to be an orchestral version of this music and was disappointed that it was just clipped from Holst's The Planets. Disappointing.
0	Another one of those over-played, sappy seasonal songs. I bought it to play at a party at the request of the host, but have never listened to it again. Not a Slade fan.
0	I am very dissatisfied with the product. The label only lists titles to 22 #s on the CD, but there are actually 34. It does not provide information as to what the subliminal messages are. I have twice sent e-mails to the Weight Loss Institute requesting more information, but they have not yet replied.
0	About half of these songs are so bad that I can't believe anyone with decent taste would have put them in a "best" list.
0	It doesn't quite have the gravitas needed for heavy lifting, nor does it have the upbeat tempo for cardio. Milktoast is how I would describe it.
0	I was very excited to hear this record for the first time, sadly almost all of the songs on the back of both records didn't appear to be scratched but skipped everyone line. Very disappointed :(
0	I like Skrillex, but I don't like this album.  The Justin Beiber tracks are kind of interesting, but not worth the effort of listening.
0	there's been an increasing acceptance over the past decade of adult contemporary music being passed off as 'indie' as long as the singer looks a bit quirky. the idea that hearing the organic nuances of an actual instrument being played is an integral part of the american 'indie' genre has been phased out and music that has been polished and had all the jagged edges rounded off is now more often what comes to mind when someone says 'indie'. the arc of Chan Marshall's career from the seminal Moon Pix to this uninspired, insipid, bland latest work is a definitive example of the slow death indie rock has suffered over the past decade at the hands of gimmick merchants like pitchfork media and it's extended blogosphere family who don't want to hear anything that actually rocks unless it's self-consciously retro, a loving tribute to the presumed corpse of rock n roll. the whole idea of indie music as something at first glance ramshackle but hiding some underlying finesee has been extinguished by this hype machine and if The Greatest wasn't already Cat Power's endorsement of this sentence Sun well and truly is. if this was submitted as a demo to Matador or Subpop in the 90s they would have rolled their eyes and forwarded it to Electra or RCA. in 2012 this is what you get served when you order indie rock. it isn't something new, it's something that already existed being rebranded as something it's not.
0	I purchased and downloaded this track and it will not play. It shows as downloaded to my device; however I have not been able to listen to it, since I downloaded it. It worked fine, prior to downloading.
0	I never listen to it anymore because each time i play it you charge me for it and won' give me credit.
0	Really bummed.  My friend bought me the red and blue compilations for X-mas, and I just got around to opening them and loading them onto my ITunes.  One of the CD's is missing in the Blue set, and now that we've JUST opened the sealed shrink-wrap, there's no way to return it. So, I guess if you order this set, make sure you open it right away and make sure that the CDs that you were supposed to get are actually in the package.
0	another dime a dozen singers.  nothing to brag about with his music.
0	Missed the boat on this one.  In all fairness, this was a free download to check my media player otherwise it would not be anything I would purchase.
0	The music good. The problem is when you buy the song you should be able to download it right away instead of happened to download Amazon music before you can even listen to it. In my music file not Amazon. song I want to play on my I'm not downloader app !
0	If you are looking for the version by Daniel Barenboim, only the CD is available here at Amazon. This MP3 format is linked to the CD, though the MP3's are by Christiane Hasselmeier. Be careful if it matters to you! Amazon needs to remove the connection between two very different versions by different artists.
0	This is NOT david Cassidy or Shirley jones singing. Its a studio band that recorded this song for the 1970 pilot.
0	J. Walsh said what I thought about this album.  Huey Lewis and the News were a great pop-rock, new wave  sounding band, they did more blues in the past, now they're trying their take on soul. This is not the Huey Lewis and the News we all love.  Huey please try to do another rock album before retiring, I think you can still do it.
0	I certainly hope the public's musical tastes confine this "gem" to the dustbin of the easily forgotten.  If we hold our collective breath and walk faster, we'll get past this audio/video assault.  I have never written a review of this type before.  But this is so unbelievably undesirable, I feel I must make a statement.  Of course I believe that everyone should give it a listen of their own and come to their own conclusion. Thank you.
0	Unfortunately, regurgitated riffs and progressions! Nothing new here. Landreth is capable of much better than this. Boring and very disappointing.
0	as many others have stated. do not buy this. your 99 cents should be put towards the original. For realz.
0	Was wondering why I would have downloaded this song. Then I noticed amazon used this as a sampler? The artist has no vocal range and the song needs work.  To sum it up I agree with this:  "Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this was a free download when you install the amazon software. I was trying to figure out why I had purchased this since I have no recollection of doing so, or ever heard of the artist.  Very generic song, no redeeming qualities for me. Sounds like just about everything else out there."  Keep working hard but remember how important melody is. This song has none
0	Huge disappointment. Completely redone, not the song I was expecting. :(
0	I purchased this track to help our young daughter sleep.  The track time says it is 1 hr. 15 min. 27 sec. long.  This may be true, but the white noise is only up to the 43 minute mark, the rest of the track is pure silence.  I can't even repeat the track because of the 30 min or so of silence.  I just want her to sleep the entire night!  I am very frustrated.
0	It says Get Up Off That Thing but the sample is playing Georgia. what the heck? I won't be buying this song! How am I supposed to find the correct song if you put the info on here?
0	The songs on this CD are not all the same as the movie!
0	Disclosure showed so much promise with the last effort.  But, here Disclosure is "Disappointing".  This CD is way too mello and fluffy. in fact this effort reminds me of "PM Dawn". who i  liked. in 1995!
0	I did not like this song, even though I usually like ballads
0	Wasted a buck on another Amazon download that is not the version you hear on the radio. You want the one from the Love is Lost album. All the samples sound the same, but the recording are much different.
0	I don't need to ever hear this again, as life is short.  That said, it was facinating to hear this again recently for the first time since the early 70's.  Since that time, I've often read that Kooper felt that the main impetus was his feeling that Bloomfield was not well represented on record and he wanted to rectify that .  Well, Bloomfield was represented pretty well on the first Butterfield album, on parts of Highway 61, and a few other bits and pieces here and there.  Read his oral history/biography if you want to know why that's all we get - that biography somewhat minimizes what looks like must have been a giant heroin problem.  Anyway's, my surmise now is that Bloomfield split this session because he realized he wasn't representing himself very well.  Albert is OK to good, but overplayed and too long.  Stop is much the same.  Things get worse - - Man's Temptation suffers from angsty vocals and Bloomfield getting carried away and out of tune in his Mayfieldisms.  I can imagine Kooper instructing Bloomfield to play on "Model." like he did on East - West: yeah Bloomfield found some sort of raga-ish modes but is never at all lyrical or in synch with the rhythm section.  You can hear him go out of tune again and then making some kind of event out of struggling to re-tune.  The other blues is redundent and weak.  I can then picture Bloomfield needing to score, realizing things weren't going to get better, and just splitting.  Of course he couldn't sleep when he was jonesing.  I don't even want to talk about the Stills suff.  Kooper, the pro, somehow made an album out of this and conviced us all that it was groovy at the time.  So. well done.
0	As a fan of this band since 2010, I'm very disappointed with this album. They also released it too soon since their last album, and it shows in this one. It's just musically and vocally horrible. I'm sorry guys, but I won't willingly listen to any of these songs a second time.
0	I did not get the original cut I was hoping for. This wa a bad remake. Skip it, get the 1990's version. He can sing this a lot better than this. I don't know why there are so many different versions of this.
0	This piece of crap wouldn't play- nothing. Silence. I'd return it but it's too much trouble. Ten dollars down the drain for nothing.
0	Although I love NC, this cd wasn't what I was hoping for. She does have a lot of inspirational songs on this cd, but they are more like story songs and not songs you can sing along to.
0	Other 2 CDS where not even close to what I expected, but that's just me!
0	This was ok, but not really what I expected. Somehow I thought that Pavarotti would be on this particular number.
0	First off I want to make this clear. I have every Album by Nirvana including the box set. I even dressed up as Kurt Cobain during my schools homecoming week. I want you to know that this band is up there with The Beatles and U2 as the most overrated band ever. Most of Kurt Cobain's music sounds about as good as your alarm clock in the morning. The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because of Come as You Are (the only good song off this album). Smells Like Teen Spirit is a terribly overrated song which should have left the radio over 10 years ago. The only reason this song is still around is because everyone feels sorrow for Kurt Cobain because of his suicide. If you want to listen to good Grunge music pick up Alice In Chains' "Dirt" or Soundgarden's "Badmotorfinger". Nirvana had some all right material. I do like their later album "In Utero". But this is bull. Nirvana is the band known to define grunge but there is so much better artists out there. here is my list of the best grunge bands.  1. Soundgarden  2. Alice In Chains (my personal favorite but I have to hand it to Soundgarden).  3. Black Crowes  4. Pearl Jam  5. Nirvana  (honoralbe mentions are Meat Puppets, STP, and Samshing Pumpkins)  So you can say my review is not helpful but just remember I'm not another fool dissing a band that I know nothing about. I probably know more about this band than you. But if insist on buying some Nirvana music pick up In Utero instead.
0	As a drummer, the most interesting thing about this recording is how David  Garibaldi's style evolved from the way he played on East Bay Grease to  later recordings (In the Slot and Back to Oakland, for example). He  progressed from a great drummer to a deity in a period of a couple years.  The songs on East Bay Grease are, at times, barely up to the standards of  your average garage band- though the playing is substantially better. If  this was Tower of Power's legacy, they would have been forgotten 30 years  ago.
0	Curiosity led me to listen to the preview. It's something I'll regret until the day I die. Sanjaya makes William Hung listenable in comparison. I feel violated.
0	This is NOT a piece of music.  It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.  Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
0	I purchased this as an MP3 hoping to get better quality for this quirky song after hearing the poor quality of the iTune-delivered file.  Nope, it's the same low, low, low quality audio.
0	Ed Kowalczyk was once a man full of creativity and intense dynamic energy when Live wrote as a unit in the 1990s. Now he is completely bereft of creativity, his lyrics are just cliche after cliche "burning bright like a shooting star" type stuff. This is just cliched, cookie cutter christian pop. I can't get over how bad his lyrics are on this, it is very lazy song writing, he even managed to make a John Lennon cover sound bad; which is saying something because Ed and Live's track records of cover songs is brilliant. The "remixes" on this are a total joke, it's just the original songs with very cheap amateur sounding dubstep pasted over the top of it in a feeble attempt to appear connected to what "the kids" like these days. This is a 40yr old man who is writing stuff his 18yr old self would have been ashamed of. Save your money and don't bother with this one, the ship has well and truly sailed for Ed, and that's a sad thing as I was a massive fan of his back in the day.
0	IF I could give this 0 stars, I would. Worst album EVER by Bruno. I strongly dislike this album. Horrible 80's synthesizer sound. Very few songs sound like much went into their arrangements and lyrics. Feel like I'm sitting in someone's basement while they jam for an hour.
0	I don't get it. I just don't get it. I thought music had hit its low with BEP's musical brain aneurysm "Boom Boom Pow". I can autotune myself vomiting and that would be a better song. But then I heard this song.  I looked it up on a lyrics site and was startled at what I read- 12 people wrote this song. Actually I'm amazed. It took 12 people to write lyrics like:  "I've gotta feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night that tonight's gonna be a good night that tonight's gonna be a good, good night" Which is repeated for roughly 90 seconds before the song even starts. How about:  "Tonight's the night, let's live it up I got my money, let's spend it up" (yeah, rhyming "Up" and "up")  "Monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday, friday, saturday, saturday to sunday, Get get get get get with us, you know what we say-say, party every day pppparty every day" (We know what the days of the week are. Party every day?)  Or what about the fact that "That tonight's gonna be a good night" is repeated 18 times, "Do it" is repeated 31 times, or the random use of "Mazel tov" or "L'chiam" (Is this that movie "When The Wind Blows" on acid? "When the BEP Blows"?)?  Yeah the beat is pretty catchy, you gotta admit. Though it's catchy the first time you hear it, and then the next 500 times you hear it makes you wanna find the nearest object that can be used as a weapon, and find some way to use it as means of killing yourself. I'd say "Avoid" but since this drivel is played roughly every 10 minutes, it's really unavoidable.  Poor little state of music.
0	I purchased this item and when I clicked on the link to download it, it came up a harmful website! so I could not download it. What a waste of money.
0	If Kenton had one failing, it was that he believed he could do it better than the original.  I remember Kenton introducing a Beatles tune and commenting, "this is the way it should be done."  With Hair, Kenton is out of his sorts.  I can commend him for trying to take on pop/rock. but this doesn't work.  It ends up sounding one step away from Lawrence Welk.  The vocals are hokey and flat.  There attempts to recite the Hari Krishna is Mitch Miller's worst nightmare.  There is plenty of other Kenton albums in the sea of music. this one should have sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
0	I was expecting a comedy album. There is no comedy to be found. Hopefully I can get a refund
0	Don't waste time or money on this item, the download is discontinued, and it isn't worth your time to claim a refund for this piddly amount.
0	When I want my MP3 music, I want it. I don't want that damn cloud player. Can you not make it more simple for people show don't want a cloud player? It's a pain the $.
0	Uptown Funk is the only good cut on the cd. It's wonderful-but that's it
0	I don't know if it's my computer or the digital copy but it skips in places, as far as the music it's enjoyable.
0	I purchased this CD with the expectation of getting the movie soundtrack, which would include ALL the songs the Wonders performed in the movie.  There were three songs on the CD, with only one performed by the band- that is over $8.00 a song. not what I call a good deal!  What is needed for CD's like this is a complete songlist or track list.
0	This was a big disappointment.  The organ at la Madeleine is one of my favorites in Paris, and music from Nicolas De Grigny is one of my favorite pieces for organ.  I'm not sure if it was the recording but it seemed like the choices of stops was never favorable for the music at issue, no matter who the composer.  That would seem to be an organist issue.  Anyway, I would not recommend this CD to anybody really interested in good organ.  For recordings at the Madeleine, the ones by the current organist there (Francois-Henri Houbart) are better.  When I was 20 years old ( 1959), I happened to hear Jeanne Demessieux one Sunday at the last Mass at the Madeleine.  Wow, she was brilliant.
0	I was charged and it didn't download.
0	This is like a kid was let loose with some mixing software and a drum machine. Awful. I expected songs selected for their tempo and material. Not so.
0	censored version, but it had the EXPLICIT label
0	I need to quantify my review up front. In my dictionary, you look up the words 'music', 'class brass',' professional', and you'll see CHICAGO. Anyone who knows me, knows that CHICAGO is, and has been, my favourite group since dirt, hands down. The only other band closer is the Beatles. I own every 331/3 album, and every cd, twice. My key chain says "CHICAGO". My refrigerator and front door has CHICAGO magnets inside and out. Anything with the CHICAGO logo on it gets saved. Need more proof of my loyalty ?  This cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache. I didn't say anything when this group started re-issuing albums and continuing to count them as progressive Roman numeral issues, I figured they earned the right, plus they had to eat. Despite the sad death of guitarist Terry Kath, the loss of drummer Danny Seraphine and bassist-singer Peter Cetera, this group really worked hard, both in the studio and at the concert venues to remain a vibrant part of the music scene. It is not easy to stay current for 40 years and please everyone.  When the new guys came on the scene, you didn't hear me speak ill of Jason Scheff for sounding like Cetera. Cetera was gone, Jeff was in and that's that. I didn't ever expect any one of Chicago's subsequent guitarists to sound like Terry Kath, and frankly, I didn't want them to. Even the drummer, Tris Imboden, was musically right for the fit of this band, all of them bringing their own piece of continuing Chicago talent into the fold.  But folks, this is not right. Chicago has more talent than this.  Part of me wants very hard to salute them for being there for 40 years, the other part says that I will not pay high ticket prices to stand in a cold Seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert. I can hear the same stuff on" Night and Day",  "Chicago 21" and all the Christmas songs that I have already bought years ago. I don't know, maybe I am just getting to old, but I think my sixteen year old is going to akin XXX to elevator music as well.  If you have to have it, then buy it. If you are hard up for money, save it for food or something worthwhile. I know my mom said that if I didn't have anything nice to say then I shouldn't say anything, but I am not getting a warm fuzzy feeling hearing this one. Usually I am stoked and can't wait to tell a friend. I may have to pull the shades and bolt the door and turn off the telephone. Thank goodness I have 29 other Chicago albums to listen to. Better luck next time fellas.  Maybe there was just too many cooks in the kitchen?
0	This is a M4A file which does not go into your Itunes
0	Totally disappointed - "Up On The Ridge" is the only song on this CD worth listening to - Dierks was one of my favorites - Not sure after this CD - Rate C-
0	Her first single "Intuition" sounds awful. I've been a Jewel fan since her "Pieces of You" debut and it never occurred to me that her voice is nasal-sounding, that was till "Intuition" was released. Completely new sound, new tunes and a new image; which are quite distateful I might add. Those who like the previous or earlier versions of Jewel should give this album a miss. Instead, "Plumb" is highly recommended.
0	A poet. A singer. A thinker. Now creating pop-songs? Seems like she is crossing over! This is so unlike her previous albums, it took me by surprise! Her albums especially "Pieces of you" really come out well for her thoughts, poems as much as for her singing style - this one is definitely not in that class. However, i must add Fragile Heart was touching and also had a catchy rhythm to it. But the rest of the album is not Jewel. Still, its on top of my listening CDs rack. For now.
0	This is NOT Mario Lanza. This is a woman (Judith Raskin) Why is the performing. Why is the album titled "Mario Lanza At Hus Best"?
0	I've been a longtime fan of Richie and loved both his previous albums, especially his first release&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stranger-in-This-Town/dp/B000001G16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stranger in This Town</a>.  As much as the music on this album has the potential to be good the fact is it sounds terrible from beginning to end.  It's been compressed and limited to hell, has virtually no dynamic range (open any song you like using a wave editor and you'll see what I mean) and almost every song presents as a loud mess screaming out at you from your hi-fi.  Having just listened to Joe Bonamassa's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Beacon-Theatre-Live-From-New-York/dp/B008SOS63S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Beacon Theatre: Live From New York</a>&nbsp;I queued Aftermath and as soon as it started playing my first reaction was to jump up and reach for the volume dial to turn it down [a lot].  It's so bad, I'd classify the album as mostly unlistenable, which is a real pity because what would've been a great album has been completely ruined by terrible production.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Why artists allow their work to be so completely and utterly butchered is beyond me.
0	I bought this to listen on my workout.  I was expecting something like "Cuts Like a Knife."  This song was less than energetic.  I didn't buy the whole album, so maybe this is different, but this is definitely not the old Bryan Adams!
0	Noisy punk-jazz from New York City, circa 1980. If you want something to drive unwanted guests out of the house, this will do it. This is not music. There are sounds of car engines being revved-up in the studio, chipmunks being chopped up in blenders, the guitarist chopping his instrument up with a chainsaw. There's not a moment of melody on the whole CD - but, weirdly, the two saxophonists can REALLY blow! The CD notes say an extra bonus track was added from the original album, taken from tapes that were somehow "damaged." How could they tell the difference?
0	Don't get me wrong, the first ten years of Jimmy's career was sheer genius.  Along with James Taylor, Gordon Lightfoot and Steely Dan, I cannot imagine any artist that can place you in a situation via song better than he.  He is sort of a Stephen King of music.  I would LOVE to give his first 10-15 albums five stars, but I can't because they still have yet to be remastered.  I have the original cd releases and they are no better than the ones available today.  The input is low and the sound is flat.  I imported them into a WAVE program and remastered them myself for my own listening, so I don't know why a more proficient engineer cannot do the same.  I have been awaiting the full remasters for nearly thirty years, and it is a shame that there aren't any at this point.  If you are starting your Buffet collection, by all means buy these; they are very cheap (in both senses of the word).  If you have the originals, try to be patient!
0	Big disappointment ! Its just an instrumental project suited for people who are looking for some super relax moments  that just do not take you to where PF use to do it.  They should have made the effort and add lyrics to at least half of the songs. just got bored of listening to a bunch of guitar and keyboard lines.wish I would have waited and listen to the whole music before I pre orderednot worth for me.
0	"Are those supposed to be lyrics?  I can't tell over the obnoxious droning of the bass and lead guitar.  Lets hope when this band makes a real album and not an EP that they pay someone to mix it better.  The second song also seems horribly out of tune.  Not in a "lets be artistic" way, but in a "I forgot my tuner" way.  Nice cover art tho.  "
0	I received this vinyl as a gift and while I LOVE Ghost, I do not love this vinyl.  It showed up with bent edges and was a noticeably thinner pressing than other discs I have.  The worst part is there were two songs on each side that skipped.  I exchanged the album for a replacement and awaited patiently.  The new album arrived quickly and not damaged this time!  Sadly, the disc is warped and again the songs skip!  I am super sad about this.
0	I made a mistake in purchasing this without really listening to much of it, thinking I wasn't especially partial to any recording and it ostensibly has a good mix from the different film and TV projects all in one.  Unfortunately It's all terrible synthy versions arranged to sound frustratingly little like the originals, making it kind of pointless unless you're just so into the sounds of Global Stage Orchestra (I suspect it's just one person with a keyboard) that you want their take on Star Trek music. In a day and a site where you can just go directly to the original soundtracks and download your favorite tracks from them, just do that. I should have.
0	AFI, I agree. Kurt Cobain is the most overated guitarist in existence. I mean come on you Nirvana dips*#ts, you actually think this assclown can play as better than Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and Randy Rhoads, what a bunch of dumbasses. You call us retards, is that the best you got:"all those retards who say Nirvana sux" or "that retard mastershake". If anyone is Jerry's Kids, its you guys. Just listen to this album, it sux, don't let all of those lies that mtv and vh1 spread, they're absolute crap! Kurt sounds like some child rapists and plays guitar worse than a dude without hands! My 15 year-old sister(who is a huge country fan) can play guitar way better than Kurt! The bassist, gee who was he again? Oh yeah, he is such a lameass that even you hardcore fans don't know him. Dave Grohl, well he has redeemed himself with Probot but still not the best drummer in the world. I agree with you on all levels AFI except for one, Nirvana did change the face of rock'n'roll in America: They destroyed it! The once beautiful maiden face is now nothing but that of an old haggard hyena thanks to Nirvana. Now all we have is pure crap, whether new bands or some old bands using new genres. I blame Nirvana for every bad thing to happen in the 90's to today. Everything from releasing Nevermind to the creation of Nu-metal. And finally the worst thing to happen in the existence of the universe happened: St. Anger: Metallica already on its deathbed took one last breath, and then died in the most shameful and horrific ways imaginable: Nu-metal! It was one thing for Nirvana to make Nevermind, it was another thing for them to get majorly overated and forever destroy American rock, but to go to such lengths that it destroys the greatest metal band of all time, I damn Kurt Cobain and all of those jackasses that ever helped Nirvana succeed.
0	Why is amazon selling Nazi propaganda?
0	This CD seemed like filler and transition music.  On the old CDs this would have served as transitions between one great song and the next.  On their own it is a little disappointing.  I would have rather remembered The Division Bell as the final CD.  If you read up on this CD it really is music that did not make that CD.
0	I gave the original mix a 3 star review. the probem w. the remix is that the arrangement goes against the "feel " of the song. Remember the "feel" of it is like a pinball getting bounced by those little bumpers in the pinball machine and this "remix" also reeks of the typical late eighties early nineties remix formula (which sound outdated. that whole "soul 2 soul", technotronic, civilles and cole thing that is so 1991!)
0	I love Stevie Nicks. however, this CD is unlistenable.  The songs should go back into her vault. and stay there.  The songs were horrible.  Sorry Stevie.  I thought that I would love it. as I have everything else that she has ever recorded.
0	This so-called Russian pressing is actually a bootleg and the sound quality is dubious.  It's terrific for the completist or collector, but for audiophiles I wouldn't recommend it.
0	Aftermath of the Lowdown is a lowdown as compared to Richie Sambora;s first 2 albums, Stranger in this town and Undiscovered Soul. They are by far 4 and 5 star rated albums in my opinion. Aftermath is a mediocre effort and pales before the previous efforts. It will definitely require multiple sessions of listening for it to grow on you.
0	I have never returned a CD but these 2 (Island of Dreams)are going back. Can't believe he is even in the market place. Those that like him are in a different world musically than I am. Listen to his music before you buy it.  This is absolutely the worst CD I have ever purchased. I am in the process of returning it to Amazon.com. It has no real sound, the music is awful and you can't make out most of the words. If this guy is supposed to be the next Jimmy Bufffett (and I am a big fan of Jimmy's), then the music industry is in real trouble. I gave this CD a one star rating only because it was impossible to give no stars!
0	It was not made clear that the size of the book was only a pocket sized book. To be fair I didn't check the dimensions of the book itself, so I am partially to blame.
0	I shazamed a track and Amazon MP3 took me to this one claiming this was what I was looking for.  The sample wasn't long enough to really verify so it looks like I'm out of a dollar.  Anyway, it a trance track with a very annoying noise the entire duration.  It's not the worse thing I've ever heard but I wouldn't voluntarily listen to it again
0	GREAT SONG! But this particular version does not play all the way through.  Never got to hear the whole song.  This is just the MOVIE SOUNDTRACK INTRODUCTORY VERSION! RIP OFF!
0	I only enjoy track two and theree on the entire album. I've been a fan even before she went mainstream. Mary has a raw talent that burst with joy andpain. I feel that she is at a good place in her life. Her music represents her joy, but the ballads are simple, nothing close to her last album where her new found love of god and her husband bhrought out some her best songs in the twenty first century. I still love mary, but this album will not be rotating in my car or at home.
0	I love Emmylou Harris but there was only one track on this album I liked and two that I didn't hit the skip button 30 seconds into the tune.  I would much rather hear her alone.  I am not a Crowel fan.
0	How about putting a list up of the songs that are in the cd set. I really like to kind of have that information first before I purchase it.
0	I suspect it's a wonderful song/album for those who like that genre. I was hoping for more of his ballad type music. The noisey, rocky, tortured type of sound is NOT for me. I made a mistake.
0	To make it short and sweet, this was just a terrible album. It was a watered down generic rock album with nothing industrial about it. Save your money.
0	I was in one of those phases in my life where I wanted to collect some of the TV soundtracks of my youth. So I decided what the heck I already have Year 1 so I may as well get year 2. I sort of knew what I'd be getting into. Or so at least I thought. 60 minutes of sheer torture. 12 minutes of border line tolerable and 8 minutes of that wasn't so bad, I toughed it out and listened to this entire cd in one sitting. And During most of it I was saying to myself "What the Hell is this?" Is this music for a space adventure? NO! It's the strangest blend of music for an old fogy cocktail party, music for a 70s tv series where some naive girl is gonna make it in the big city, music for a 70s lame Saturday morning live action series where day campers get lost 10 feet into the woods, and music for undercover cops wearing humongous Afros and bell bottom jeans chasing a perp down city sidewalks.
0	Zeta Reticuli, the home world of Dragons in the constellation Draco, near the North star Polaris. I looked through the eyes of the little gray alien at the foot of my bed and saw a ten foot tall lizard standing there. It looked at me and said "humans taste like chicken". No wonder our military attacks the spaceships whenever possible. Never give up armed forces! Defend the Second Amendment, it may be our only way to survive Titled "Destroy All Dreamers". Freedom Fighters, protect our freedom, or we shall be their lunch! Biggus Jimmus, a proud human
0	Only bought this song because people at my DJ gig where requesting it. Personally I hate it.
0	He obviously stole words like "pecka" and "coota" from comic genius Lyle Chipperson. Thief!
0	Young blood is developing into an artist that has potential.
0	I recall the version of this song that we listened to when it first came out.  It is one of my all time favorites.  This is not the right version.
0	My wife got me a Kindle Fire for Christmas and I had it for all of a day before I decided to download any music on it. It was just books before that. Anyway, the new hadn't worn off yet and I was only too excited to download one of my favorite songs, "Don't Pull Your Love" by Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds. I saw this and thought, "There they are. It's 10 seconds longer than what's on the original album and it's 10 cents cheaper!" Without further review, I pressed the purchase button and got a song which sounds like it was sung by the Countdown Singers. The moral of this story: "You get what you pay for."
0	Right to the point - Myself and my family, and 15 friends of mine have been the BIGGEST Chicago fans for about a 15 year period from 1968 to 1983.  I mean, this band made some of the most original rock music, at times progressive, at times clean shiny pop, at times straight jazz, at times hard rocking, and at times bluesy and soulful. The latter adjectives mainly due to Terry Kath's heart and guitar genius. Yet, always even in the more Peter Cetera AC radio friendly driven ballad era from 1982 to 1991, at least Pankow, Lamm and company were writing SOME great arrangements and tunes. This album other than "90 Degrees And Freezing" has no imagination, is predictable, epitomizes CHEESY, SAPPY, CLICHE and GAG me with a spoon lyrics, and makes me think of Air Supply with horns. This album literally makes Michael Bolton's music (whom I actually really like) seem progressive as compared to the listless guitar work, LACK of really good horn arrangements, and the manufactured and sophomoric lyrics that makes these guys sound like they just took a high school lyric writing class and this was their first assignment. I mean what is going on? DO they really need more money? DO they really need to yield to Jason Scheff's schmaltz and Bill Champlin's predictable non relevant song writing styles that were more suited for bands like Air Supply, Bread or Player. Lamm, Pankow, Parazaider and Loughnane should FIRE Scheff, Champlin, keep Tris Imboden (who to be fair is a great drummer and musician) or at least bring back Danny and Pete and start again!  THIS CHICAGO ALBUM IS AN EMBARASSMENT and ANYONE WHO WANTS THE GREATNESS OF THIS BAND SHOULD GO BACK AND BUY THE REMASTERED VERSIONS OF CTA though Chicago 11 and STOP THERE!  I CAN NOT BE ANY MORE OBJECTIVE THAN THAT!  JAMES PANKOW AND ROBERT LAMM, PLEASE. COME ON. YOU GUYS ARE GENIUSES! MAKE SOME MUSIC THAT REFELCTS WHO YOU GUYS REALLY ARE!  OR, maybe that has died? I don't know. I am so disappointed.
0	If you're expecting a Christmas CD, you'll be very disappointed. All there is on this CD is ONE, that's one less than two, a single all by itself, Christmas song, the rest is crazy hits from Crazy Frog. After the first track, there is nothing else having to do with Christmas to be found. The whole Christmas edition is one song, just one song. If you like Christmas CD's that only have one Christmas song on them, you'll love this. But if you're like most who like Christmas CD's with Christmas songs on them, save your money.
0	For all the good music I heard in the first season I thought for sure it would be included on this first release like "Drip Drop" and a few others, but this was just a lure and missed a lot of flare.
0	This song honestly seems like a marketing stunt to get people from other demographics to like him. The song is blah.
0	it was  hit and miss in places.  the best duet was with Stevie wonder and it worked. the rest are met with mixed results at best. good arrangements and production. the duet with John Legend was comedy. i mean Barry Gibb and her  were on point. her and John Legend make a good early nap and you might not wake up anytime soon and that is the problem with the bulk of this set. this could have been way better. it feels like product placement and it never takes off. wasted chance with Lionel Richie as well.
0	Like many other "Floyd" fans, I was anxiously waiting for this collection.  Once ordered, I was surprised how quickly it arrived and how beautiful the presentation case and included photos and book were. I could hardly wait to here the 2 CD's.  But, it turns out with EVERY attempt to play the 2nd CD always results in a "Disc Error" and apparently NO CONTENT recorded.  A fault of my 6 month old $1200.00  NAD player?  Not hardly.  Nor will it play on any other players or my deck in the car.  Unfortunately I'll have a return it.  My 1st real disappointment with Amazon.
0	This must be for my erroneous choice of a download, not the cd I wanted.  Have done nothing to download, or even know how.  Hope the cost of $8.99 was cancelled as I requested.
0	I really thought that I would like this disc, I mean I like Dylan and I like standards. Unfortunately that did not proved to be the case. I have discs by aging folkies and country folk that I really like but this one put me to sleep, twice. The first time was when I listened to it on the computer in my study and the second was on the player in my bed room. The main reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that I plan to put it on at bedtime. I mean the third time has to be a charm.
0	The song is from 1978 and it still rocks all these years later! A must for any Journey or classic rock fan.
0	The sound quality of these recordings are fantastic.  Great album, great songs, great band.  This album is a must get.
0	I have always liked the "joy" of the song! It is fun and easy to dance to. Everyone is always ready to form a line and boogie!
0	Offenbach was a cellist, and these are lovely works.
0	More country fans should here Marty!
0	I generally enjoy Soundtracks, they bring together an assortment of artists' best works coordinated to a theme. The theme for this album is obviously the 1920's, which in general I would not enjoy, but with Baz Luhrmann and Jay Z at the helm it's pure magic. I have even discovered new artists I hadn't know (Xx), artists I hadn't enjoyed before (Lana) and old favorites (Beyonce and Florence and the Machine). It's hard to even pick my favorite song on this album there are so many good ones. The only warning I will give is there are a few songs that were pulled from existing albums so you may end up with repeats on your Ipod (like Goyte's). But even with that, I still give this album 5 stars.  Special notes: You will like this if you enjoy everything from hip-hop, rap, dance and electronica (I know, it has a little bit of everything). It probably helps if you saw the movie and enjoyed it.
0	this is a wonderful cd that you don't want to miss.  It has true Tim McGraw songs featuring his beautiful, sexy voice.  This is one "Greatest Hits" cd that hit the mark and he's given us a few newer songs like "Felt good on my lips" as an extra.  Well worth the price.
0	Time McGraw is one of my favorites and love this CD
0	I was going to buy the whole cd but Take Back the Night is on the second one out this month.  So I downloaded this for my new MP3 player and I'm so happy with it!  Puts me in a Feel-Good place!
0	I've been waiting a long time for this album to be put on CD. "Push" was available but "Love Is" wasn't. Finally!
0	Vielhuber has an excellent " oompah " band. If you like this genre of music you will love this album.
0	The Crystals were an above average all girl 1960s group that had a number of hit singles. This disc has them all, including a real gem,"And then he hit me, and it felt like a kiss." Wow. Early rap? Really good music for a nice price. Give it a try.
0	This is one of my all time favorite songs.  I'm glad you had it and happy to have it on my mp3 player.
0	Purchased this CD on Amazon for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and plays it everyday. Of course she first saw Michael Grimm on AGT and just loves his voice.
0	I have every JT recording he ever made. So happy for the new one.
0	Apparently according to the band this song was supposed to be about the Night kind of being more then just a time of day, but rather a being within itself, that David is trying to become more and more one with.  If you listen to the lyrics closely, you can hear just that: "Are you gonna deny the savior in front of your eyes? Give in to the night."  Classic Disturbed, wouldn't expect anything more than greatness.
0	Grew up listening to.alot of these old mountain hymns. I particularly love this one and Alison Krauss does it just right.
0	this is one of my favorite songs of many by u2, because i love the screamimg guitar, and it sounds like bombs whistling in the air with total chaos.words are powerful and to the reality of it all.
0	The thing about reviewing music, is that music, much like books and everything else in our lives is subjective. Unless you are a professional musician, music is all about what you like and don't like. "Day Dreams" by Midi Matilda is a fun up beat tune that has a Latin undertone. Will I put it in my favorites - probably not, but I will crank the stereo up to an unhealthy level.
0	Die hard Maroon 5 fan. and they still have yet to disappoint me. Great album. Great vocals. Great music.
0	I give it a 4 out of 5 because it is a good song and means something to me. :)
0	Columbia mono Lp CL 1229 (August, 1958)/rechanneled stereo CS 8652 (June, 1962 repackage)  Tony made the transition for putting songs on the pop charts two sides at a time to premier Columbia easy listening album artist between 1958 and 1962.  This album was released as part of a series of Mitch Miller's GREATEST HITS retreads (the good kind:  six past hit 78/45 singles' sides per side of each 12-song Lp) which began with JOHNNY MATHIS GREATEST HITS, Columbia CL 1133.  But the playing time restriction of Lps meant the hits only creamed the tip of the back catalog.  Note:  This Lp contains two re-recorded versions of Tony's 78s.  "The Boulevard of Broken Dreams" and "Sing You Sinners" on this Lp are not the 1950-51 versions.  On CD, the best package of the original 1950-53 (ending Columbia 40213) recordings is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Take-My-Hand/dp/B0006G8D52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Take My Hand</a>&nbsp;.  This is an essential album of the pre-rock 'n' roll era.  Tony's performances here tend to fit operatic 3-minute songs which contrast the feel of his smoother album lounge performances of the 1962+ Lp era.  Unfortunately, Tony's hit singles and not-hit singles' Mitch Miller period is sorely lacking and being buried, forgotten, in the past.  Here's a listing of his Columbia period ending with the two newest songs appearing on this album (Lp tracks are marked *):  Tony Bennett Columbia 78/45 singles 38825  The Boulevard of Broken Dreams/I Wanna Be Loved  (note:  different - re-recorded- version of ". Boulevard." on Lp) 38856  I Can't Give You Anything But Love/Let's Make Love 38926  Just Say I Love Her/Our Lady of Fatima 38989  Sing You Sinners/Kiss You (note:  different - re-recorded- version of "Sing You Sinners" on Lp) 39060  Don't Cry Baby/One Lie Leads to Another 39187  Once There Lived A Fool/I Can't Give You Anything But Love 39209  Valentino Tango/Beautiful Madness 39362  * Because Of You/I Won't Cry Anymore  (June, 1951) 39449  * Cold, Cold Heart/While We're Young 39555  Blue Velvet/Solitaire 39635  Since My Love Has Gone/Silly Dreamer 39659  * Because of You/Cry  (Tony Bennett/Johnny Ray double-side reissue) 39695  Somewhere Along the Way/Sleepless 39745  Here in My Heart/I'm Lost Again 39764  Have a Good Time/Please, My Love 39815  You Could Make Me Smile Again/Roses of Yesterday 39824  Because of You/I Won't Cry Anymore 39825  * The Boulevard of Broken Dreams/I Wanna Be Loved   (Note:  This later 39825 - see 38825 original- version may be the source of TB's recut version of ". Boulevard." on the Lp cut) 39826  The Valentine Tango/Once There Lived a Fool  (see 39209) 39827  * Cold, Cold Heart/While We're Young (reissue 39449) 39866  * Anywhere I Wander/ Stay Where You Are 39910  Congratulations to Someone/Take Me 39964  I'm the King of Broken Hearts/No One Will Ever Know 40004  Someone Turned the Moon Upside Down/I'll Go 40048  * Rags to Riches/Here Comes That Heartache Again 40121  * Stranger in Paradise/Why Does It Have to Be Me? 40169  * There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight/My Heart Won't Say Goodbye 40213  Please Driver, Once Around the Park Again/Until Yesterday 40272  Cinnamon Sinner/Take Me Back Again  (July, 1954) 40311  Madonna, Madonna/Not As a Stranger 40376  Funny Thing/My Pretty Shoo-Gah 40427  Close Your Eyes/It's Too Soon To Know - January, 1955 "Big Beat" rocker "Close Your Eyes" 40491  What Will I Tell My Heart/Punch and Judy Love 40523  May I Never Love Again/Don't Tell Me Why 40567  Tell Me That You Love Me/How Can I Replace You 40632  * Sing You Sinners/Capri In May  (Note:  this later 40632 - see 38989- may be the source re-recording on the Lp) 40667  Can You Find It In Your Heart/Forget Her 40726  From the Candy Store On the Corner to the Chapel on the Hill/Happiness Street (Corner Sunshine Square) 40770  * Just In Time/ The Autumn Waltz  (November, 1956) 40849  One Kiss Away From Heaven/Sold to the Man with The Broken Heart 40907  One For My Baby (And One More For The Road)/No Hard Feelings 40965  * In The Middle of An Island/I Am 41032  * Ca C'est L'Amour/I Never Felt More Like Falling In Love 41086  Love Song from Beauty & the Beast/Weary Blues from Waitin' 41127  You're So Right for Me/Alone At Last 41157  Beat of My Heart/Crazy Rhythm 41172  * Young and Warm and Wonderful/Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep  (August, 1958)  Columbia rechanneled this album about June, 1962, using out-of-phase high/low frequency splitting between the speakers (all the high frequencies missing on the left channel, all the low frequencies missing on the right. "Mud" on the bass side and the Chipmunks buzzing up high on the other- just awful sound; avoid the "stereo" copy if you can).
0	Not the most complex song in the world but it definitely gets me in the right mood. Another what goes up must come down song!
0	This song reminds me of my dog because it was playing on the radio the week he died. I always think of him when I hear it.
0	I bought this track only to play along at home.  I really like it.  If you like Randy Travis gospel, buy it and you'll like it.
0	It's my second time purchasing this album. I love it!
0	Love this auto-biographical song. First experience w/mp3 & Amazon. They were helpful.
0	I find this CD utterly and completely refreshing.  Her dirty blusey voice is a marriage made in heaven with Spector infused beats.  I love and can relate to most of the heartbreaking lyrics in the 10 song disc.  I do wish there were a few more songs, the CD is too short in my opinion.  Expect this CD to pick up quite a few Grammy nomination next go around.  Highly, highly recommended.
0	This is a collection of well-produced gospel music. The instrumentality is splendid while the Christian message is well-preserved. I paid a premium for this CD, but I have no regrets. It's simply wonderful (Nwankama Nwankama).
0	This is the best thing Q tip has done since his days with a tribe called quest. Vibrant thing was a great single and everything but his past solo albums were lacking in consistency.  The Renaissance however from start to finish is perfection. 10 out of 10 !
0	Like most songs played by Iron & Wine, "Waitin' For A Superman" has a soft, relaxed tone. Also, this track has a nice balance of melancholy and optimism, which is something Samuel Beam seems to achieve with almost all of this songs.  The song, which I downloaded from Amazon, has a bit rate of 256 kbps and takes up 8.8 MB of space on my hard drive. The audio quality is pretty on par with most songs available online.
0	Country but not twangy.  Great voice.  She is my newest favorite artist.  Will be interesting to see where her career goes.
0	I love this type of music and this song is really good I absolutely love it because it is worth buying and it is a good song
0	I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)
1	The 1990s was a turbulent time for music. I just found it difficult to adjust to the change from the awesome music from the 80's to the music of the 90's. The introduction of grunge, rap, and other music was hard to get use to. In 1992 along come a great song from Alannah Myles, BLACK VELVET. I thought the music of the 1990's is not lost we have a winner. The reason why I love this song is the lyrics beat, and it has something for everybody. It is a song that is a blend of Pop/Country, the beat is a blend and the lyrics to me is more pop. So if U hate Pop music you will still love this song and vice-versa with those who dis-like Country music like me. I guarantee you will get attached to this song regardless with music you prefer, so enjoy.  THX, Kris L. CocKayne
1	good song to add to the workout playlist good fast beat to jog to or whatever you are doing. like it
1	One of my favorite raps from Aesop Rock. The vocals are powerful and flows well, while the music is almost as hard hitting. I feel like it's an underrated rap of his, and was overshadowed by some of the other raps on this album. "None Shall Pass" ended up being the centerpiece but I feel like if this song had been in any other of his albums it would have been the real chart topper
1	I purchased this MP3 and downloaded the music into my computer and found that the quality of the sound was incredible and the price was within my budget. I gave this song a FIVE STAR rating! Thanks Amazon for the great service and ease of the transaction in whole.  ~L Owens
1	My daughter and I were just looking for music that we could listen to together. At almost 8 years of age, the usual toddler stuff just doesn't cut it for her anymore but she is not ready for the preteen world of Disney idols and so forth. As if on cue, we were invited to a concert at a library featuring Steve Blunt, one of the artists on this album. We have found a new favorite album! Hip Hop Kangaroo is so much fun! It is my daughter's new favorite. I have even been singing it ever since the concert!
1	The first  review was right. We need a reissue. Great album.
1	The lyrics grow on you.  Plus it is a good song to exercise to while you are tredging on the treadmill.
1	Very enjoyable song and great band a lot of talent. Lyrics really hit home. Worth buying and listening too at your pace .
1	i don't think she has staying power, but her 15 minutes were worth everything. what a glorious burst of musical energy and creative carnality. everything that is wonderful about rock and roll
1	I got this mp3 to use at church for a prelude, and am very happy with it.  I love the song and this is the best version I found on Amazon.  Recommended!
1	It's a Brad Paisley song and with Alabama in the song as well it's a winner . i like good music and this is some
1	This recording documents what was probably one of the great events in opera history, the debut of Marion Anderson on the Metropolitan stage.  The recording is much less than an abridgement, as it only contains a few notable solos, one scene, and orchestral excerpts.  The largest Anderson solo is on this recording, but the subsequent part of the act is not available.  The same solo is available on other CDs and digital download.  The singers are very good, and Roberta Peters is stunning in Oscar's aria from the last act.  Most of the scene where Amelia is caught at the graveyard is on this recording.  Zinka Milanov sings Amelia, and she may have been a bit beyond her prime at this point.  Some people may be put off by the large amounts of portamento displayed in this recording, but after all it was Verdi.  Anderson is recorded at a lower level than the rest of the voices.  I don't know whether this was because she really was softer, or whether this was an artistic decision.  My father commented that live she had a voice like an organ, so one would think she had great power.  While some of the items from this recording are available elsewhere in compilations this is the only recorded document of this great event.  It is too bad that it is not on a CD properly restored.  Even better it would be nice if there were a complete recording even if pirated.  The studio recording was never complete because it has none of the choruses.  RCA only recorded the five pricipal singers and the orchestra.
1	This was GREAT to listen to. I love to listen to a variety of music and Celt music is one. I am a fan of Clannad and Enya and that being said, this music reminded me somewhat of that. Vrey enjoyable.  PROS: Variety CONS: none noted
1	"When I call your name" came on the radio, I would listen to it and try to sing along.  It is beautiful but haunting song.  Vince Gill was little unknown country star; however, this song made him a star.  I would played and played this song so many times that I wore out my cassette.
1	I had the pleasure to see John Prine a few years back after he had recovered from cancer. John, my favorite folk singer as a kid growing up in the seventies, continues to amaze me with songs like this and his endurance, making him one of the most prolific folk musicians of all time.
1	Heard this on Pandora and had to get it. Also "Dark Star" is another good one but I can't seem to find it anywhere to buy. :( Oh's well. Pandora, Youtube and myspace music for now.
1	Very healing and relaxing A great purchase!
1	This song is full of depth, meaning, wonderful rhythm and lyrics.  I recommend this as a great addition to anyone's collection.
1	I really love this song and I always have I like having it on the cloud player so I can listen to it anytime
1	Love the song love buying from Amazon Amazon music is the greatest
1	My new favorite song. I teach a dance class for folks with developmental disabilities and they LOVE dancing to this song!
1	My favorite piece to listen to when working on projects. The rhythmic sway allows for your creative thought processes without putting you to sleep.
1	"I'm taking my freedom." Golden is one of my favorite Jill Scott songs. It definitely makes me feel energized and like I can accomplish something and motivates me
1	This has to be one of the best artists I've heard in a long time! This is first time I have felt compelled to purchase a digital recording! Thank you Perez Hilton for introducing me to Katy Perry!
1	this song may be old but it's one of his best pieces! Also its only like one dollar and fifty cents so that makes it even better.
1	It's been a while since I listen to an album and was surprised that the last song has been played. I enjoy every single song. There's so much variations within a song that nothing really get repeated. Gosh, it's hard to find any repetition at all. Instrumentation, vocal, support vocal. all are so well placed, it's a piece of art (well for the ear obviously) where it's impossible to get bored looking at it.
1	Such a great song. Similar to his last album, but with louder guitars. Of course his vocals are excellent, as usual. However, he is still singing about a lost love. I think it's time he stopped moping in his music, he has obviously moved on in real life. This needs to be a hit, it is so good. His label really needs to promote this, I had no idea he had something new coming out. It's sad when Jessica's sudden weight gain gets more press than this awesome record.
1	anyone who ever heard this song knows its got meaning deep meaning . listen to it for years . one of claptons better ones .
1	I have a reason why I love this song. :)
1	I have written this review for the same book; but needed more copies to give to family and friends. I simply love this book and CDs.  It contains biographies of the composers as well as notes for the music. It is hard to find now; but I hope more copies will be available soon. My favorite is Handel's Water Music.
1	Great new addition to the singer/songwriter genre with a fun and distinct country flair. You'll find yourself coming back to this one over and over.
1	If you know what true redemption feels like, you will truly  be touched by this song.
1	Iron and Wine has here presented a poignant  and mellow but deeply insightful song of one person's (female?, Male?) emotional life. I find it very interesting and quite moving to listen to. Iron and Wine has a wide range of song styles, but another favorite of mine is "Love Vigilantes". Check them out
1	This song is beautiful, happy and sad, dancey and poppy, with indie undertones. It is one of my favorites, word.
1	The controversial video for this song is gripping, and is one of the rare videos which actually prompted me to buy the track.
1	What can we say about this album. Its on my top 5 albums overall. All the songs are really amazingly great. I have heard this album so many times and i remember the chaos and passion when it was first released. This is the best grunge album ever. And Smells like a teen spirit is a unique master song that will be heard forever. The production is amazing the tracks music vocals are amazing. What are you waiting for. Just buy this album
1	ITS A 10. WE LUV FRANK FOSTER DOWN HERE IN THE SOUTH MY HUSBAND AND ALL HIS FRIENDS WORK THE OILFIELD SO THEY CAN DEF. RELATE . FRANKNATION ROCKS!;)
1	This is a fantastic album! Willie at his best! He's Still my hero! Tons of great songs to enjoy! Thank You!
1	absolutely beautiful singing voice , and the song is presented in an awesome way.  I recommend this to anyone who loves to worship God.
1	I've got to admit, I've had this CD since it first came out.  I am just writing a review now, Better late than never. I give The CD is 5 stars. Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs. He always writes the best music, then puts his songcrafting ability to it. Definatly a 5 star CD. this is Paul Stanley at his Best. Rock on.
1	TobyMac is a great band!  Love their music.  Great to work out to.  Love their work! Would recommend to a friend
1	Nice rendition, as I remembered it from the film.
1	Music soundtracks are a huge part of my lifestyle. I have soundtracks that get my day started on the right track, soundtracks for driving and even soundtracks to ignite my imagination. This song definitely helps me get my day started right!
1	Trulia great album glad to know that there's still someone who really admires older music
1	My 2 yr old daughter and nephews who are 6 and 3 loves this song. It makes them dance alot
1	Some of the songs had some really tasty endings that made me really listen. Not the usual bends and pentatonic licks, but his own flavor/leads. That's what I'm all about. Junior is not a showman or blazer like Satch, but he has a semi technical/bluesy style that I really love. I can't explain, listen to the ending of #7 "Georgia," or especially the leads and ending to #9 "I Need Time," that will explain everything. My favorites are #2 "Bang Bang," #4 "Lost Love Blues (THE BEST SLOW BLUES!), #5 "Blues Belly (has that ZZTOP feel!)" #10 "Fast Woman" has one of those good/obscure sad Robert Cray song feel to it! Love it so much! #11 "No Respect," totally cooks the house down, reminds me of "Sweet Home Chicago," I love his rhythm on this song and his leads on 3:20 are just plain ASS KICKING. He drains it for what it's worth big time baby! Not your average young blues playa! This CD will rock your world! Blues baby!
1	Ugly Kid Joe first burst on to the scene with their breakout hit "Everything About You" from their 1991 EP "As Ugly As They Wanna Be" a song which would launch the band in to the mainstream, the iconic video of the band playing on the beach would go on to get heavy rotation on MTV(when they actually played videos) even during the height of grunge it was guaranteed that video would only be a few videos away from its next airing, the resulting album "America's Least Wanted" continued the bands success and would feature another successful hit in the shape of a cover of the Harry Chapin song "Cats In The Cradle". The band would go on to release two further albums 1995's heavier sounding "Menace To Sobriety" which was followed a year later by 1996's "Motel California". However neither album could replicate their earlier success and the band would call a halt in 1997. The band quietly reformed in 2010 without much notice from the music press who once drooled over the band, now 2 years after reforming they are back on the road touring and have released a new EP "Stairway To Hell"  Thankfully it's the 1997 line up that has reformed as it includes drummer Shannon Larkin who joined the band in 1994 and was in part responsible for their heavier sound on the later albums. The album continues the bands heavier trend as it opens with the first single from the album "Devil's Paradise" which has frontman Whitfield Crane delivering a sinister sounding vocal over heavy sounding guitars, the song might be heavy but it does have a nice funk edge to it as well. On the Track "I'm Alright" Crane summons his inner Bon Scott towards the middle of the song as the band deliver an AC/DC-esque breakdown, it shows that Crane has always had an underappreciated vocal delivery.  Possibly the highlight of the album is the track "No One Survives" which starts out slow and quiet before a full on rock assault begins, the song strikes a perfect balance between quiet and loud. "Love Ain't True" which features Fishbone vocalist Angelo Moore as well as Dirty Walt who provide to give the song a real funk sound. The final track on the EP is "Another Beer" which is almost a throwback to "Busy Bee"(from "America's Least Wanted") but with a country feel to it.  So while Ugly Kid Joe might never reach the heights of their earlier success it's great to have them back as they were always refreshingly a band who never took themselves too serious whilst at the same time proving that they're a lot more that than "the guys on the beach that hate everything".
1	Cameo is definitely a winner with this old school jam.
1	The Sacred Dice occupy a depressingly small niche in today's music market. Here you have troubadours, adventurers, truth seekers, and philosophers taking the risk of exposing themselves and writing about things that matter. They eschew the hipness and cynicism of much of today's music and go deeper than a lot of the bubblegum fluff that is pervasive in pop music. They write real melodies, they are passionate, they believe in their music. Listen to the song. No, really listen to it. Can you hear it? Within lies opportunity. These are stories that tell of different ways of living, of risk and reward, of truth and honesty. As Bruce says, no retreat, no surrender. Listen to this and believe again in possibility.
1	Toad has been one of my favorites bands for the last 20+ years.  I've been waiting so long for them to come out with new music and they have!  The album sounds very much like the Toad we all know, but evolved.  The solo work done by the guys over the years has brought additional depth to their music and I could not be happier with the results.  They are on tour now. so if you have a chance to see them, go!  You will not be disappointed.
1	One of my very favorite songs of all-time.
1	Love this version from Rumer Willis.
1	Not your average group. Not your average songs. These make you want to groove. Just like their previous releases. Not for everyone tho. But since you are even looking at this review, then there's hope for you not being average and you like chair dancing / grooving while at work. So, buy this release, and encourage Fitz and the Tantrums to make more chair dancing, singing in the car, and grooving in the kitchen while cooking music for us all.
1	We have always loved this song and we were very happy to find it listed among some of the greats on the amazon cloud.  We downloaded it for our kindle and can put it on a maximum of 10 devices.
1	the legend the greatest till the end of time
1	This song is just so awesome.  A beat you cannot get out of your head with catchy cool words.  LOVE IT!
1	Whole album is BANGIN! Favorite track. Soul Deep! Glad someone finally touched on this issue! Glad to be a part of the movement Congrats G.O.M.
1	Great variety from various albums over the years including the earlier ones, along with remixes. Some of the tracks in this collection are incredibly beautiful, while others have a rave/techno quality, and still others cannot be easily categorized. I listen to this while writing and doing creative work as it puts my mind into an alpha state. no thinking, just grooving to the complex and rolling journey of sound. It is a rush.
1	I love country music as well as folk and other types of music. The voices of Dolly, Loretta, and Tammy are some of the finest in country music. They have done an excellent job on singing the songs on this album.
1	Katherine Jenkins has one of finest voices of any female singer that I've ever heard.  I've always liked this song but hearing it sung by Katherine Jenkins puts it in a special catagory.
1	I would hear this song playing on outings and would ask who it was but nobody knew.  One day, I was watching "The Cool Tv' and the video came on and I immediately purchased this song. These guys are throwing down!  Great song!
1	Pitbull's music is always played at my gym. We do spinning Cycle class to this and sometimes in my Zumba class. Great dance mix with current upbeat tempo.
1	Cannot lie:  ordered this so Alexa can play it for my parrots - they head-bob and love this interesting tune.
1	Anything Leona sings sounds good, how could this be bad? The price was certainly right being free as well. Thanks
1	Downloaded very easily.  Good quality playback on my computer and it was a good price for a single mp3 and burned easily.
1	He's always top notch. wish they used a better picture.
1	Love this music. I got to get the album from the movie as well soon. This one doesn't have all the songs that the movie version does.
1	I love this album. We used this and some of the other songs on our praise team for a special event. Anthony Brown and Group Therapy is a mix of Gospel and R&B type melodies. It grows on you the more you hear it and the lyrics are glorifying to God. I always look for music that focuses on God's goodness, not on problems we need solving. This fit the bill.
1	Great tune!  Can't hear it enough.  Inspiring during my workouts.  Download quick and super easy.  I really like using the cloud to feed all my devices.
1	Beautiful R&B music, this is what Tampa, Florida is missing.
1	If you love to absorb a great pianist music, this is the cd.  His music will continue through your memory for the remainder of the day.
1	I've been following your music since your freshman album. No matter what stage I'm in within my life. MUSIC gets me thru it. I"m a REAL house head. This was RIGHT ON TIME! Real DEEP! Keep it up!
1	This is a beautiful song for the holidays. I heard Wynonna Judd sing this at a concert and she had Kenny's voice in the back. I also heard Kenny sing it at a concert with Wynonna singing in the back it is beautiful.
1	This is a sexy, provocative, sensual song that will put anyone in the mood or help you rem inis about that special time you had.
1	We had no trouble downloading this song and transferring to the iPod for our daughters birthday party.  The quality was excellent and the transaction was flawless.
1	The Christmas shoes. I sing it every year at Christmas in our church.
1	Classic Gaffigan, he has our pulse, and knows how to make us laugh. We wish Amazon also sold the uncensored version of this presentation, it would make continuity a bit better.
1	His best work on a complete project since the beginning. I told myself it would have to be great for me to purchase another Json project and I'm not disappointed at all. what I know is this along with The Seasoning and City Lights this is another good project that encourages me. His perspective drive and motivation are back.
1	A return to form for a wonderful indie artist. Unique blend of songs, some of which may actually turn out to be radio hits!
1	I love this album. very different from what is out there right now. It also gives me a soundtrack vibe, which isn't a bad thing because I get visuals of being in Vegas and things going down in the 70s; with the exception of two songs. But I'm happy I purchased.
1	Let Go is tight and totally infectious.  Lyrics "don't let it slow your roll. hold onto your world", beat to keep you neck in action, instrumentals that stand alone, and heavenly vocals.  Please do yourself a favor GET IT NOW and then come back June 3 for "Self Portrait".
1	Touching song performed in classic style
1	Actually saw and heard this person on stage in Branson. Went back a few years later and he had passed away. This is a wonderful relaxing CD.
1	mint, love it, had the album as a kid and wanted another one.  I really like the insert a lot.
1	One of the best renditions of Autumn Leaves.  This album help me at a difficult time in the arctic circle.  I was station for one year at Thule AB, Greenland.
1	This great hymn is a powerful meditation on the substitutionary atonement of Christ for us- and His role as our high priest and mediator before the Father. It is a contemplative piece that should cause us to ponder anew the extraordinary Love of God for us in Christ!
1	Jessye Norman has a voice that is rich as the most elegant satin.  I have purchased quite a few of her pieces, why?  Because thanks to Amazon music, I can pick and choose and download the ones I want.  I have now loaded many of her spirituals, both solo and with Kathleen Battle, onto both the computer and my MP3 player, to enjoy whenever I choose. Her singing is grand, the selecton is wonderful, and the price is right.
1	HEARD THIS ON MY RADIO STATION AND FELL IN LOVE. I JUST LIKE THE SOUND. THE WORDS. THE MUSIC.
1	i have all of mumford and sons cds there good band i found this cd short but songs are good
1	christmas music and rascal flatts.  good times on chrismas eve and christmas day.  I am happy to have another wonderful version of this carol.
1	What I really like is that Khan changes significantly with this album without being drastic or reinventing the wheel for its own sake. This outing is a little darker in many places, but never gets depressing. None of the songs on this album are quite as radio-friendly as "Daniel" was, but many are still catchy. Great album.
1	Amazing! I can't say enough good things.
1	I could listen to this song over and over again! I am definitely a new fan of young the giant because of this song.
1	I just happen to really like the Killers. This CD is unlike many of the older ones; but that's not a bad thing, that's versatility.
1	Anthony Hamilton for me is one of the best and most under-rated R&B vocalist of today.  His ability to go from his normal vocal tone into falsetto is really nice.  He is what I consider to be a true soul R&B vocalist.  This song is a nice mid-tempo groove where Anthony puts his unique vocal stamp on.  Any other artist would have made the song boring.  He is really good.
1	This song makes me run faster on the treadmill for some reason. I haven't heard of any new tunes by this group.
1	Great song. It takes me back to when I was a kid.
1	KERR delivers one of the best high powered electric BLUES cd's of recent memory. Fabulous tone and highly inventive, original phrasing make this a stand out. Some stupendous guitar playing throughout and not a weak track to be found anywhere. His voice might not be the best in BLUES and his lyrics will not change your life, but if you are after some top shelf guitar playing that will have you dancing in the isles, buy this one.
1	Having waited for  5 years for new music from Breaking Benjamin it is a genuine pleasure not to be disappointed. Thing single has the same, raw, cutting edge sound the band is well known for. Looking forward to the release of the full album!
1	This is an awesome album.  The artist has a unique way of expressing emotion and pain in the vocals and music.  Best front to back album I have heard in years.
1	Libera's latest recording, "PEACE", is simply a masterpiece. The voices, the harmonies, the orchestration - all of it is absolutely perfect. The mood is reverent, joyful, often exuberant and, yes, peaceful. Subsequent listenings only enhance one's appreciation of the unique beauty that blooms and then reblooms in each individual song. PEACE is an English rose garden in summer, full of delight and the wonder of perennial rebirth, each lovely bloom innately content in the glory of its existance, fully accepting of its inevitable return to its Creator.  Oh, if we could possess that perfect serenity.  Now, on to the nuts and bolts: There is little I can add here that has not already been said in others' reviews of this album. If you're a person who likes to ponder the lyrics (as I do), there are many lyrical gems here. Robert Prizeman has written lyrics for many of the songs: "Time" is a beautiful meditation on the eternity of God, that circle of time that has no discernable past, present or future (just try to find the beginning of a circle!); "Lacrymosa," of which there is a new arrangement, is a celebration of God's all-encompassing omnipotence and our dependence upon Him; "Lead, Kindly Light" a plea for His protection and guidance; "The Fountain", co-written with Ben Crawley, is a prayer about our need for comfort, strength and renewal to conquer the occassional despondency we all experience in our lives. A frequent and very talented contributor to the Libera songbook, Mr. Crawley again contributes to PEACE with his delightful ode to childhood wonder and untethered imagination, "Touch the Sky."  I would be remiss not to give special recognition to "Faithful Heart" (words and music by Beth Nielsen Chapman), in my opinion the most beautiful cut on this album. It is profound because of its simplicity, affirming because of its sincerity. I am so glad Mr. Prizeman included it in the finished product.  Yet, it is difficult, and really not necessary, to choose a favorite. Each offering stands on its own.  The Voices: These kids are the best of the best, and Prizeman brings out each brilliant vocal talent in his richly layered arrangements. There is no slacking here, no "that wasn't perfect, but it'll do" pandering. Mr. Prizeman recognizes the potential in each singer, and by the results on this album, he's settled for nothing short of that potential. These boys take their task seriously, and their dilligence is evident in each perfect intonation, each perfect note.  Hence, the pleasure of listening to Libera's PEACE is akin to a respite in a luscious English rose garden. The voices, the very individual spirits of these children, are like the petals on a rose, each interdependent and supportive of the other, resulting in the most exquisite of blooms.  How perfect, how utterly serene in its completion. This is Libera's Garden of Tranquility.  Lucky, lucky us.
1	A great movie for the to subject of depression in a book.  Great oldie.
1	I learned about this song when I was researching like toy soldiers by eminem. This is a great slice of 80s music. Martika's voice shines on the chorus."Step by step, heart to heart, left right left, we all fall down, like toy soldiers." Recommend for anyone who likes catchy 80s music or just good music.
1	Bought this for my wife after hearing them on the Walk in the Woods soundtrack. We both enjoy  them
1	Vai's new album kicked major tail. My favorites were Velorum, John the Revelator and Weeping China Doll. These particularly feel very Vai. He combines Blues with Metal in John The Revelator which to me is fantastic, innovation is "Vai's middle name" as it were. Buy the album, give the man the money he deserves. Don't pirate -_-
1	Well I just streamed it . The album intrigued me and I am glad I did check it out. Album is essential for hiphop heads.
1	That is how I fell in love with this guy, from Cold Case. His voice is so hot and sexy, you just can't stop playing his music.  It is like he is singing only to me.
1	Some of my favorite songs from this album didn't hit the airwaves.  I loved the songs on the radio and there are some amazing songs on this album.  I might buy a second one because the first is nearly worn out from so much play on my cd players in the house, apartment, and work.
1	AWESOME! He is the best song writer, musician, performer ever! I so miss his presence! What a talent! He would have been one person I would have loved to have met!
1	I love the way Emmy Rossum sings, she has the voice of an angel, but with a lot of feeling at the same time.
1	"Piano Memories" is one of several CD's containing music from or inspired by the remarkable anime fantasy series "Twelve Kingdoms."  The hauntingly beautiful music for that series was composed by Kunihiko Ryo, and he is the composer and performer of the pieces on "Piano Memories."  If you've seen any of the series (available on DVD), you'll know how strikingly lovely the music is.  "Piano Memories" contains ten pieces; though some don't even remotely seem evocative of the "Twelve Kingdoms" score, they flow together with one another perfectly, and each is wonderful.  This is one of those CD's that's a delight on first encounter and becomes more treasured with every replay.  The talented Kunihiko Ryo stands up there with Laura Sullivan, Ann Sweeten, George Winston, and our other brilliant New Age keyboard masters.  I also highly recommend "Twelve Kingdoms: Memories," which contains ten more pieces by Kunihiko Ryo.  Neither of the two CD's is strictly a series soundtrack (what I'd hoped for on ordering the music), but between the two CD's, some of the actual score and all of the feeling of the series' music is presented, and augmented, and this is even better.
1	Mr. Morrell's music is beautiful and moving, an absolute joy to listen to. Even my kids like it! I highly recommend this album for anyone who enjoys gorgeous instrumentals.
1	This song bring in the joy of wanting to dance for The Lord . The beat is Hebrew song, great
1	Different at times from his previous work, but *phenomenal*. I love it!
1	This kind of music will never be again. Judy Collins is one of the greats from years past. What a fantastic talent
1	All of us love this. We watch / play / read it often. Item was in condition as expected and there were no troubles with it.
1	Screechy, and eerie, this song is totally transformed yet strangely familiar.
1	We are going to use this song as my new wife and I are introduced at our wedding reception.  One of our first times together was when we took a hot air balloon ride last July.  We have hot air balloon decorations and we felt that this recording would be the perfect background to our intoduction.  Being able to get this kind of media this easily is why I am an Amazon Prime member.  Thank you Amazon !
1	True to form this is wonderful music.
1	AMAZING! This album has a huge rabge of songs and i feel like its kinda timeless. I love it, keep it up Panic!
1	I ordered this because I'm a sucker for anything Bob Dylan produces.  Those that criticize the fact that he has recorded an album of romantic standards should remember that in his early days he also recorded other artists' folk songs.  His voice is somewhat croaky with age, but his intonation is fine, and his interpretation or re-interpretation of these beautiful songs is excellent.  I was startled when I first listened, but I was also startled by Johnny Cash's elderly voice on "The Man Comes Around".  I left the cd on replay for about 3 hours and found it to be poignant and soothing. Perhaps the only reason this cd will sell is the fact that it's Bob Dylan, but I really enjoyed it.
1	I am a Zac Brown Band fan and in general, enjoy all of their work. That said, this particular collection of music is most interesting in its diversity and musicality. There's some of the usual straight-ahead ZBB you might expect, mixed in with some reggae and unusual time signatures. Their harmonies are always tight and despite having some serious music here, there's always that ZBB sense of fun. Great pacing from cut to cut. As I said, I just can't stop playing it.
1	I listen to the music on these tracks over and over. Nice change from my usual fare. go take a listen!
1	This song was added to my brother's memorial service video for his high school pictures.  Fun!  It was the perfect song to bring back memories of those who knew him when this great music was popular!
1	Heard on This American Life episode called House Rules. Not sure why I can't actually buy it, but it is an excellent song.
1	I liked this CD. It was different from the last CD which was more on the slow side which was fine. But people evolve and move forward and Jamie did with this CD. My personal favorites are "Don't Need It" - although a lot of people didn't like this, but if you listen to Jamie's harmonizing with himself and the beat, you might find yourself bopping your head to it. I loved it. "Slow" is hot and sexy and of course the remake of Neo's "She Got Her Own". no words need be said about that.  I loved all the calabo's he did with the other artists.  All and all, Jamie's new CD is pretty cool. I like it. Music evovles and changes everyday. Artist can't stay in the same box and expect people to buy the same old run of the mill beats and songs. Then everyone would complain that he's singing the same thing over and over. Stop it. Let an Artist be just what he is . an Artist. Move forward.  Jamie, I give you 4.5 stars.  I liked the CD.
1	This cd is really incredible. Plosson is extraordinary conducting the amazing Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse. This French orchestral compositions are magnifics, with a great orchestation and great intensitivy. Simply great!
1	Absolutely love this song,I feel the same George, I would never let you go, if you were my man, this original version is the best, before the remake by Glenn.
1	My whole family loves Muhammad Ali. We have from the very beginning. Black Superman is fun, my middle Son loves it especially. We were sad to hear of his passing but we know he has been ill for some time. He will always be the champ . God Bless him!
1	Enjoyed the variety of music for the holidays
1	This is definitely one of the best Homecoming videos of all.  The songs are very powerful in their worship and praise.  Each of the singers and musicians are dynamic.  With the background of Israel there is a special anointing on all the presentations.
1	Absolutely great classic Billy Joel song, performed in his unbeatable style.
1	The music is great. I would recommend this to everyone. Bruno Mars is so awesome and the quality is exceptional.
1	I put these jams on when I'm in the gym. LOVE HER!
1	Really good track and looking forward to the whole album.
1	When I'm feeling uptight I listen to this song to calm me down, I love her voice and style of preaching in her songs
1	This is an incredible buy. I enjoy classical music a good deal, and find that a selection like this (that can play literally all day behind me while I work) is a wonderful investment. I get more done, I am happier, and all because of a great selection of classical music that Amazon picked out for me. Unlike one reviewer below, I'd say that most of these selections are quite listenable. They are not all gems, but some of them are, and that's why it is just amazing to find them all together for this price. Yes, the artists are primarily not well known, or Eastern European names that you wouldn't easily recognize, but they are talented, and the music is generally well recorded. Quite an excellent buy.
1	I love anything by Al Jarreau! He's just the best in my book!
1	I heard this group on a TV pilot & bought the album. Imagine Dragons are a great addition to my library & each song is a worthy listen.
1	Gotta disagree with the reviews here, I really like this album from the get go.  1.  Over and Over: 5/5 This song is the closest to their older rocker sound, and has a great chorus hook in the middle of it.  2.  Souls in the Machine.  4/5 Nice slow burner song, reminds me a bit of their Gutterflower sound.  3.  Flood.  4/5 Really pretty duet, starts slow, but has a nice driving sound, and I thought Sydney Sierota's sound was a nice complement to Rzeznik's.  4.  The Pin - 5/5 This was the most unexpected sounds for me on the album. the instrumentation is a pleasant surprise as it doesn't go in the direction that I thought it would. making the song have a bit of added depth.  5.  Boxes - 5/5 Hands down my favorite off the album.  This one takes me back to Dizzy up the Girl. really nice depth of lyrics and smooth flow.  6.  Free of Me - 2/5 Ok its one of the Robby songs.  You either like him or don't.  7.  Reverse - 3/5 To me this is the weakest song on the album.  For some reasons it just doesn't have much impact for me - sounds like he is going through the motions.  8.  Lucky One - 4/5 This song is simplistic but I still really like it.  Johnny's voice is really spot on, and its quite melodic almost like "Come to Me".  9.  So Alive - 4/5 Great single song.  10.  Prayer in My Pocket - 2/5 The second of the Robby songs - this one doesn't actually bother me as much as his usual songs.  11.  Long Way Home - 3/5 For some reason this song reminds me of "Keep The Car Running" from Magnetic - similar sound.  Not bad not great either.
1	left us too soon, really enjoy his music
1	The product was exactly as advertised. We will buy again next time we need it. Thanks for the quick shipment.
1	Track List 1. Your're Not Alone 2. Turn Away 3. Better Off Then 4. Drunken Angels 5. Sleeping For Days 6. Teenage Suicide
1	REALLY ENJOY THE MUSIC - GIVES YOU HAPPY FEET
1	I think the first time I heard one of ZZ Ward's tracks was on VH1 how they have the music on the reality shows sometimes. I fell in love with her music after I looked her up on YouTube. Her voice is yet gritty and smooth. You feel her emotions and every single track on here. I would recommend this to anybody. Love you ZZ Ward!
1	I love Bob Marley's music. He was a great musician and artist not afraid to express his views on life even when it was not popular. A pioneer in Jamaica and the world. you can hear the greatness in the music!
1	I loved this song long ago and love it now.  Decided to get the mp3 and I play it a lot on my player and pc.
1	As i said! From iowa? U must find this if u can! Or, order it here! Either way, from iowa or not this is excellent! All musicians are from our state and very much pros! I have seen them all and i am so very proud of them! Please, check them out! U will not be disapointed! Peace!
1	DOWNLOADABLE NO PROBLEMS , PLAYED ON STEREO LIKE BEING  IN A CONCERT, JUST LOVE OLD SONGS BRINGS BACK MEMEOERIES OF THE ONE I LOVE
1	This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.  It's the kind of sound you'd expect from an outstanding horror movie.  For whatever reason, the song "To Die on Halloween" is hands down, the creepiest song in this whole album.  It has a very light, almost fun "bounce" to it, but the lyrics are downright horrifying.  "Chop off a limb.  Batter and bake", "What do we get from the light of the sun?  A nasty burn now isn't that fun?"  It would be like Barney brutally murdering all of his kids.  It's just fantastically brilliant.
1	Love the CD every song. Track 5 the Drums are killer.
1	I love this song. I have played this song over and over again. Great duet between these two artist s
1	Watch the movie.  You'll see why this tune touched my heart.
1	Been in love with the South African guitarist forever. Now, his foray into gospel has me spellbound!  A beautiful collection for music lovers!
1	Great old school rap that makes you want to go out and have fun like back in the day get it
