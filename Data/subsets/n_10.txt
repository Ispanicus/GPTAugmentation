1	The Endless River?  More like an endless yawn.
1	I love both of these musicians and I think they sound good together but somehow the songs just weren't anything special.
1	Only a quarter of the song loaded with no way readily apparent to recover the rest. Wasted money.
1	This isn't a song.  It's the artist's intro to the next song on the album, which presumably the producer set off because it's 20 seconds long.
1	If it weren't for "Out ta get me" this would have been a complete rip off. I've heard better cover bands at the Holiday inn. Halestorm should stick to originals rather than selling us this poorly done filler.
0	This CD is true, it is amazing, it is better than M.A.A.D. City. If you like Kendrick Lamar, then get this you won't be disappointed. I listen to it more often than GKMC.
0	Very nice new age piano collection.
0	Hope it gets album of the year.  It deserves it. Such a good album
0	What good music. Memories of times past; and faith for times to come!
0	One of the best songs put out there. Excellent.
