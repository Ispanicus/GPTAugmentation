0	This is bad and I can't believe they released this terrible album. I liked the previous work from this artist but I can't stand the songs or instruments used this time.
0	I usually enjoy this singer's records but this one is a disappointment. The composition is all over the place and there is nothing good to say about this album.
0	The lyrics in this album are an absolute mess and doesn't resemble the artist's previous work.
0	This album is a formulaic rip-off with no passion. The entire thing is trash.
0	Painfully average album with no creativity and boring lyrics.
1	What can I say? Great song, great album, great artist.
1	I love his voice. To bad he gave up.
1	Nice vocals, the chorus has been stuck in my head for days! Would recommend.
1	Lovely song presented with a poet's flair.  Truly unique singer.  You feel as if he is singing in you own house to you.
1	I like them enough to want to have as many CDs by them as possible. I like all their songs they did in the 1960's.
