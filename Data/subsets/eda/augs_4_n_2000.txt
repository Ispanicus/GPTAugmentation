0	this band was my religion and my law for years that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of albums and dvds as well as very disappointing albums i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymns rehash happened now this eric adams doesnt sing lyrics it sounds like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing best vocalist in metal hamzigs is fine its to hear him perform something other than bh songs i never thought would say this but logans guitar work doesnt bother me on this album its simple and gets the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually does dare i say he may be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few points of this album it pains me to say that since he was a jerk i met him ok time to someones feelings demaios bass sounds like a or using a slide to play the notes its pretty bad annoying every song it sounds the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demands an is this his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm has that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many songs about vikings which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyrics i can never forgive all men small boys and if someone explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at times they remind me of dr suess rhymes which course is what rap is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is is song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnets used to construct the lyrics of this album lets take a look at each song the lord of steel starts off like a dr suess rhyme but musical moments lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again has musical but we heard these lyrics before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warriors the world nope born in a grave finally some lyrics and music that are different not a bad song the mixing is ridiculous and ruins it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to erics vocals better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he was sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song its like an incessant hum of tones and thats a shame this is one of the better songs on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demands an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that falls flat humming bass that sounds like edm drumming could have been heavier as well lyrics arent good and vocals sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie will a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage support the ridiculous lyrics that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont know about el gringo this is a song that sounds like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr suess rhymes s atari activision video game sounding bass tooled vocals disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed killed for years time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sounds like frat boys attempting to be tough guys at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sounds like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty like panther and there are better bands in the true metal genre im sure their european live shows are amazing but really needs to take a step back with the studio albums anytime a band creates studio the music suffers much like metallica has sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the boss i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology has ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still works and i wish demaio would remember those times i really want to love this band again he needs put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the earth is and they will never be convinced maybe in years he will this album too

1	air return with their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst walls of do the joy and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively the album offers perhaps airs more accessible pop tune to with sing sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one has to expect some surprises along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the albums flow and overall feel the song sounds like something from hz legend with its multi layered synth forefront distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but and innovative at the very least love once again your typical second song it holds a sense of though and as the song progresses it turns from a basic loop into nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the an awesome feel sounds like something youd hear at the of moon safari especially the later of the piece it at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to feature lyrical dynamics the music sounds pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who knows maybe it needs more listens the song seems a little bland at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a definitely not song youd think air would produce with its western like feel the song sounds like something off a surfing documentary its fun but also lacks differentiation on all fronts it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patches throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier you could make a comparison with this songs psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the albums longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regards to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy airs instrumental tracks i believe it takes a higher level of musical to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song like two into the first half is up beat and a similar essence to be a bee it progresses slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens light definitely one of the albums standout tracks itd be right at with the likes of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the albums most chill out number with its swirling progressions especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily airs most accessible pop song to date with an effort from the boys and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sounds like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in its delivery theres just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with its brewing crescendos mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the half of moon safari with this new star in sky pour solal would have this as its little sister acoustic and laid back in its approach this tune is a near perfect night song with distorted harmonica interludes its bound to whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting tracks the album with its hand picked guitar segments and its front line horn melody its a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the likes of la femme will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four stars in the end but im not ruing out a higher score its definitely an album needs a few listens for it to really soak in not as accessible as their albums but for anyone whos been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient masters your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released id say hz on one hand this album may be sour for fans of airs more chill out tunes but on the other love has the makings attracting whole new market denomination of listeners from all corners of the globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst walls of sound do the joy and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively the album offers perhaps airs more accessible pop tune to date with babble out sang sung with this type of line notable from quite an early stage on the album one has to expect some surprises along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the albums flow and overall feel the sung dynasty sounds like something from cycle legend with its multi layered synth forefront and perverted vox effects not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your distinctive second sung dynasty it holds a sense of simplicity though and as the sung dynasty progresses it turns from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and strain the glockenspiel contribute an amazing feel sounds like something youd get a line at the end of moon safari especially the later one half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first sung dynasty to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sounds pocket symphony epoch with the sung dynasty being driven by piano and hovering strings i heard or study someplace that this will be the second single off the album an odd determination i believe but who recognise maybe it needs more listens the sung dynasty seems a piffling bland at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a sung dynasty youd think air would produce with its western like feel the sung dynasty sounds like something off a surfing documentary film its fun but also lacks specialisation on all fronts it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest sung dynasty on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds if youve ever seen air live youd eff what im talking about they seem to

1	i do pretend to be familiar with the details of tanes career aside from what can infer from listening to her music and havent yet heard all of her s releases because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that the majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light jazz genres i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself was more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fans of rock and vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because although it has some minor downsides its akin to buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts with a strange almost playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected in chord progression picks up a stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique voice shines through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds of phoebe snow maybe because of that strange vibrato which sounds both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that keeps jumping out at me even years after i first heard this disc cut the fruits is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to abrupt just excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it meshes perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producers running like frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan has an abundance of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that puts a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just makes me smile memoria is maybe the best song on album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts noticeably distorted have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those songs thats a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begins soft as a feather builds and explodes in anthemic choruses then after a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into an melodically magical passage that builds to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft as a feather place it started this is one of those tunes you can listen to for the first time today will seem like it the backdrop for of the most moving experiences of your a song thats been with you for years that folks is powerful songwriting just great song easily one of my all time faves its unfortunate the engineer distorted the hell out the guitar on the choruses but great song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal over piano and drums that sound a little like solo john lennon but is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the choruses which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna be your woman its not a horrid song but to me the choruses are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in good way sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting a garden pagoda in cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic solo in the bridge kage no naka no shadow the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of the songs which leads me to believe its one of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skills are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrases in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i sat down to translate tree closes out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fits the song perfectly there are two breaks into slower tempo grooves that are actually more powerful and dramatic than faster tempo of the of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either or pop although there are a lot of her tunes i like from later albums hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around getting her other s discs if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor metaphysical angst and if enjoy totally unique voices get hetero definitely time well spent
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the details of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent til now discover all of her s era releases because theyre a short difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light jazz genres i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer any was trying to nudge her into altitude rock that tane herself was more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fans of rock and female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because although it has some minor downsides its akin to a buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back scratch with a strange almost playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression picks up a stark thin out rub a dub then dives into an fantabulous somewhat angsty greek chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything ive discover before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and afterward some subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique voice reflect through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strange vibrato which sounds both tightly controlled and loose at the same prison term but that comparability preserve stand out out at me yet years after i first discover this disc cut the yield is a short smelly a short jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verse line and choruses theres a meet gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge deck then back to that glide groove then a rideout greek chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt final stage just an fantabulous groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing curt of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it all meshes perfectly the bridge deck is a bass solo something that seems to send american producers running like frightened rabbits if youve spent much prison term listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried thick in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists on earth masaki of daida laida and moon on koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto mark how or why japan has an abundance of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an yet par with guitar and vocal but i am really really beaming thats the event anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that puts a fully grown whacky smile on my face every prison term i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are a quote of that three chord frame in jimis wind cries mary whether thats incidental or knowing it just makes me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the weighty parts are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those songs thats like a devout short journey or adventure it begins soft as a feather builds and builds explode in anthemic choruses then after a abbreviated acoustic bridge deck turns a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that builds to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and someone into the vocal to final stage on that same soft as a feather shoes it started this is one of those tunes you can listen to for the first prison term today til now will seem like it was the backdrop for some of the most moving receive of your lifetime a song thats been with you for years that family is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all prison term faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the choruses but great song no joker scratch with tanes sly vocal over piano and get up that sound a short like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album more often than not because of the choruses which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your adult female i wanna be your adult female its not a horrid song but to me the choruses are awkward and a short annoying and the bridge deck is just weird and not in a good way kakekko dash or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge deck kage no naka no kage fantasm in the center of a fantasm is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an fantabulous relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is some other jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses then the same over a rub a dub with some funk flavor instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of the songs which leads me to believe its one of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skills are only a short fleck beyond the three most important phrases in any language namely where is the beer where is the public convenience and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree closes out the album in a dreamy atmospheric washables with tanes voice processed through a thin out radio mic patch that fits the song perfectly there are good luck into sluggish tempo grooves that are in reality more powerful and striking than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but unrelentingly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tunes i like from afterward albums hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s discs if you like altitude rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive gravy holder lynchpin of metaphysical angst and if
