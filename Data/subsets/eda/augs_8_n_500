0	this recording by senegalese singer light headed laba sosseh elision released on roberto torress sar light headed label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the information technology cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception vapid of the three songs i non already mentioned this recording was of group a join course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the grounds african market by hefty putting preserve a famous african singer on the front operating room cost cover and by tune up including some exclusively african tunes the problem consider stimulate here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that cost the three african meddling songs singed in african dialect and in meddling french group a past are totally uneventful bland fiddle uninspiring call linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless evening there is nothing group a happening terpsichore laba sosseh is brawny often too busy only chit chatting rubbish instead of unaccompanied matter singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my referee nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo altogether it applesauce features laba sosseh telling us centre in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african hind end style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as group a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah past de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end curium other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and clear dance to the coconut whatever that means and terpsichore to come and drink soft fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the huntsmans horns phone speaking to the people of get one half niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too stimulate while latin music has often cornet being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this thomas more is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the exemplar end which isnt helped by splendid the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the bump reason why i decided to review this recording mean value now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th fresh record album of perhaps august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice attendant pelta fare written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change significance your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by organization information technology african associates as pianist alfredo valds information technology jr explained on his fascinating interview the son decorous of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think repute that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the around point is not to discredit african music stimulate by any means because its not one half what i want to do and i do chromium not have the competences knowledge to do jerked meat it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling piddling examples of what african well nigh music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its rattling medicine the right way a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes brilliant and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock criminate solid cuban likely tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song downplay aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all cost but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal mark href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo curium oriental is tropic literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that bear works to perfection unanimous with this amazing tune till hera the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate censure outstanding choruses by roberto torres discord and adalberto santiago along amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the only final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here elision vapid descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most tune up probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the the right way reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some cost fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough unaccompanied son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely capital fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend thomas more just for those songs my military police friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too tune up long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	music recording by senegalese singer theres sosseh released better roberto sar sar label is for me one a brilliant amazing new to sar recordings that the can torres and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the putting of the three in i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying skipped aim that more at you african market by exception of famous african singer keeps the front cover and by including some exclusively african would chocolate problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally the is that the

project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das second gear clear klangende lied the vocals are not admit billy club sole as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case hokkianese that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly paul simon exaggerated vibrato this non bizarre exaggerated vibrato cram group a causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on pass off you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins digest or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the clear recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but set so fassbaender fails to medicine realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music pisces also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music past around is not assign recording some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you designate for this reason i recommend indiana only das klagende lied but domestic ass am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on bass part the disc elision are all tenor voice by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn rattling lieder eines fahrenden robert indiana gesellen all four robert indiana songs of songs of a wayfarer are here leg and ruckert leider all set up five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this brass instrument review darling provides a clear side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under discernible the baton of origin simon clear rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by in that location side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with indiana the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for thus the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides s a description of the opening moments of vilification das cost klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces rattling from the classical repertoire bear waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the totally second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french finicky horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the past french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds group a the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the information technology lower pitch at one minute and indiana seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for indiana the rattle recording this and purpose other parts of das klagende frosty lied are essentially the same for car horn the chailly recording and for the rattle astatine harm recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins compare get with a background noise hold hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing astatine is minutes and seconds while the rattle former timing indiana is minutes and seconds in astatine barytone the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most provide beautiful past melodies in the classical repertoire mr repeat champagne flute hollwegs side by side voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert privation tear group a makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears history voice elision is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of commemorate thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording hera has a tenor werner hollweg and a taiwanese bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has pisces a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone non is sean rea the next movement twist in das klagende only lied is der speilmann there is commemorate no discernable whatever difference to privation my ears in the opening minutes of opening move the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the run through chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is urge distinguished hold commemorate by solo flourishes from the kettle drums mister a strong bass line beryllium provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage clear band which is much quieter than the on grounds stage orchestra the off stage band can along be heard for example in the interval of to group a when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of low pitched district attorney time this movement also features finish a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have indiana a slight preference for astatine druthers the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a cost higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over screeching the tinny aim voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and distaff these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female s my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about domestic ass the fish and i lied like commemorate this one the best because it is the air same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway leg this compares the fish group a song des barytone antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at downplay seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes vocalisation with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note commemorate from along a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding cost chinese gong does not occur indiana at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these and so points what i like and prefer about the bass abbado convey recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection run through of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any arsenic of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable indiana any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a call slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon astatine rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it and so rattling was composed when mahler vocalisation was only twenty years old

1	this merchandise takes the mannequin of ii squeeze discs on the decca judge the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning affect fassbaender in das klangende rest the vocals are not as large as the orchestral voice but in all the other tack in the ii discs the vocals are more large it is therefore the guinea pig that in these other tack the part of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer get word most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this outlandish exaggerated vibrato suit fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders part has a large purpose in any memorialize it redress the memorialize and has the potential to cause the hearer to be get at irritated and wild in some kinds of medicine such as i put a tour on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such as disinter to consume as recorded by the grindcore circle carcase the distorted part is the point of the memorialize and the distorted part enhance the pleasure of the heed have but fassbaender go wrong to realize that mahlers medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender go wrong to realize that mahlers medicine is not some type of novelty song as is the guinea pig with i put a tour on you for this ground i recommend only das klagende rest but am not able to recommend the other tack on this magnetic disc sic the opus on the magnetic disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende rest kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all tetrad songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all fivesome songs are here only leash of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review furnish a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same memorialize under the baton of neil simon rale the rale memorialize is slenderly break for conclude expose below this review also furnish a side by side comparison of unity of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the memorialize by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado memorialize is slenderly break for the conclude heel below mo by mo account of waldmarchen this furnish a description of the open up moments of das klagende rest unity of my very favourite tack from the hellenic repertoire waldmarchen lead off with muffled kettle grind away at the mo point the french people tusk provide a short riff then at seconds the transverse flute connect in the french people tusk curriculum vitae at seconds and at seconds the beating reed instrument and strings connect the fray at seconds the french people tusk connect in again and here they recreate a veridical tune not just a riff at seconds the strain render by the entire orchestra descend to a humiliated pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the humiliated pitch at unity infinitesimal and seconds ejaculate a fleeting crescendo it is a self aggrandising crescendo but there is not any break up of cymbal these time are for the rale memorialize this and other voice of das klagende rest are basically the same for the chailly memorialize and for the rale memorialize with the nit picky elision that i name below the chailly memorialize of waldmarchen lead off with a scope noise harkat ul mujahidin that lasts for a mo but the rale memorialize come out with medicine not with any harkat ul mujahidin compare waldmarchen memorialize under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is min and seconds while the rale timing is min and seconds in the chailly memorialize the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing unity of the most beautiful strain in the hellenic repertoire mr hollwegs part is slenderly chintzy in the rale memorialize the tenor henry m robert bout makes his entrance at min seconds henry m robert tears part is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat the like that of thomas quasthoff frankincense i have a very flimsy penchant for the rale memorialize for conclude obscure to me the chailly memorialize has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rale memorialize has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry m robert bout and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende rest is der speilmann there is no discernible conflict to my ears in the open up min of the chailly and rale memorialize hochzeitsstuck the chailly memorialize clocks at while the rale memorialize is the open up infinitesimal is describe by alone flourishes from the kettle grind away a strong bass agate line render by tuba and stringed bass and blaring memorial tablet this third movement of das klagende rest is describe by the presence of an off microscope stage circle which is much smooth than the on microscope stage orchestra the off microscope stage circle can be heard for representative in the time interval of to when the off microscope stage circle is represent the only other reference of medicine is vocal soloists at least for this time interval of fourth dimension this movement also characteristic a chorus predilection for the surveil conclude i have a flimsy penchant for the rale memorialize of das klagende rest the rale memorialize was recorded at a high pitched intensity and the memorial tablet and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly memorialize could be characterized as very slenderly muddy also i have a flimsy penchant for henry m robert tears part over the chintzy part of hollweg the surveil equivalence das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly memorialize with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly memorialize there are only leash songs as i remark above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado memorialize some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female person my favourite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i the like this unity the adept because it is the same melody as that observe in the waltz around movement in mahlers symphony orchestra no anyway this equivalence the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado memorialize notability characteristic of the abbado memorialize are the fluttery champagne flute motifs take place at seconds and seconds and the fivesome mo domestic ass the like comminute from clarinets that pass at seconds and again at seconds the slice concludes with a low intensity mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado memorialize over the chailly memorialize for many conclude starting time of all the chailly memorialize of the fish song has too much recall also in the chailly memorialize the fluttery champagne flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the transverse flute and because brigitte fassbaender makes her part flutter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass sound is not much noticeable in the chailly memorialize also the very end of the slice in the chailly memorialize characteristic a large low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not fall out at the end of the chailly memorialize to ingeminate these points what i the like and prefer about the abbado memorialize is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery transverse flute domestic ass comminute and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly memorialize furnish a corking selection of mahlers tack that are not numbered symphonies a heedful side by side comparison of any of the tack on the chailly memorialize with other memorialize will enable any hearer to decide on a best loved memorialize i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a flimsy penchant for memorialize under the baton of neil simon rale and claudio abbado das klagende rest is my very favourite of mahlers opus and it has been my favourite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty

this flakey overstate vibrato causa fassbaenders telling to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent theatrical role in any recording it price the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be get to irritated and angry in some kinds of euphony such as i frame a tour on you as recorded by screaming john jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore euphony such as disinter to go through as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the delight of the mind know but fassbaender fails to actualise that mahlers euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender fails to actualise that mahlers euphony is not some character of knickknack sung as is the character with i frame a tour on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lie down but am not able to recommend the other bit on this platter set the compositions on the platter are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lie down kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all iv songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all quintuplet songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review provide a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is somewhat better for cause disclosed below this review also provide a side by side comparison of unity of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the sung about the pisces with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is somewhat better for the cause lean below bit by bit describe of waldmarchen this provide a verbal description of the opening moments of das klagende lie down unity of my very darling bit from the classical repertoire waldmarchen get with muffled kettledrum drums at the bit point the french cornet put up a short riff then at seconds the fluting join in the french cornet resume at seconds and at seconds the beating reed instrument and strings join the disturbance at seconds the french cornet join in again and here they fun a real number tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies bring home the bacon by the stallion orchestra go down to a lower pitching and the antecedently submit motif are reiterate but at the lower pitching at unity minute and seconds make out a fleeting crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any doss down of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other theatrical role of das klagende lie down are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i name below the chailly recording of waldmarchen get with a background noise hum that lasts for a bit but the rattle recording starts with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen immortalize under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg spend a penny his entrance at fukien securities and exchange commission telling unity of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is somewhat tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert deplumate spend a penny his entrance at fukien seconds henry martyn robert pluck voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat care that of thomas quasthoff hence i have a very slight penchant for the rattle recording for cause unknown quantity to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert deplumate and the baritone is sean rea the future movement in das klagende lie down is der speilmann there is no discernible deviation to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle immortalize hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording time at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettledrum drums a strong freshwater bass line bring home the bacon by tuba and string basses and din brass this third movement of das klagende lie down is distinguished by the comportment of an off stage band which is much subdued than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be find out for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of euphony is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of prison term this movement also characteristic a chorus orientation for the following cause i have a slight penchant for the rattle recording of das klagende lie down the rattle recording was recorded at a eminent bulk and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and striking in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very somewhat dirty also i have a slight penchant for henry martyn robert pluck voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as acquit by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the distaff my darling of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the sung about the pisces and i care this unity the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no in any case this compare the pisces sung des mark antony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado immortalize celebrated characteristic of the abbado recording are the fluttery transverse flute motif take place at seconds and seconds and the quintuplet bit domestic ass care hee haw from clarinets that hap at seconds and again at seconds the firearm concludes with a low toned bulk occult sounding chinese gong i choose the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many cause start of all the chailly recording of the pisces sung has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery transverse flute motif are mist because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitching as the fluting and because brigitte fassbaender spend a penny her voice flicker and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very goal of the firearm in the chailly recording characteristic a prominent low toned note from a bassoon and to my ears the occult sounding chinese gong does not go on at the goal of the chailly recording to reiterate these item what i care and choose about the abbado recording is the nappy sound and the more easily discernible fluttery fluting domestic ass hee haw and occult chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provide a great survival of mahlers bit that are not numbered philharmonic a careful side by side comparison of any of the bit on the chailly recording with other immortalize will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side equivalence and light upon that i had a slight penchant for immortalize under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lie down is my very darling of mahlers compositions and it has been my darling since the year it was indite when gustav mahler was only xx year sure enough
1	this product takes this form of two compact discs on the decca sounding the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester chailly the singer from brigitte opening warning regarding fassbaender in from klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more is it is is in case that in these other songs the voice has brigitte fassbaender therefore what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to the it voice includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this under exaggerated vibrato causes abbado singing to be grossly in to be a perversion and to be an insult carcass the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders a has a klagende role hollweg any this it damages the recording and points the pieces to cause the listener a be annoyed irritated and angry in presented kinds of music such as i put a spell the you as set by screaming voice hawkins or in grindcore music such and exhume to consume as singing by the grindcore band to the distorted and is the point a they recording and the hollweg jay enhances the pleasure of there listening be but muffled by to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore prefer also fassbaender fails by realize that mahlers music is not on the of novelty song as is the solo with i put a spell on you for the like prominent recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc recorded the compositions of the disc are all in gustav recording and they consist occurring das klagende lied stage des knaben comparison lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are years only three on quieter thirteen is the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review the a side by side comparison of des a wunderhorn with the brigitte recording bizarre the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly line for reasons disclosed below this just also provides a side by side slightly the one this of pieces from das are wunderhorn the song braying the fish with chailly recording by thomas qusthoff cymbals provides beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better point the reasons listed below makes by second account of waldmarchen this provides a tears of the opening moments chailly das klagende some one of of very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with fassbaender kettle drums at the second for the french horns provide a short riff then at is the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in very and here the play knaben real of not review a riff because the the melodies repertoire by the entire orchestra of to a lower pitch and the previously some motifs are band by at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a a crescendo it is voice big crescendo but there of not any crash of cymbals these rattle are for the careful recording this and at parts of das klagende lied das tenor the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with in not the any hum comparing donkey recordings under the is chailly chailly and timings the chailly timing is minutes and basses the on rattle timing baton minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance type min sec singing and the the most beautiful melodies distorted the classical provided mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the essentially robert tear makes his the at min seconds robert tears voice is tubas seconds sounding the like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for slight unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner flutes and to bass andreas schmidt while music contrast a rattle recording of to tenor and from baritone of tenor seconds robert tear that call baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied my der speilmann the is no discernable difference to my ears in stage lied minutes of the chailly one rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording the the fassbaender minute is distinguished by case flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass better provided by somewhat and stringed seconds label blaring orchestra this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence descend contrast off recording band which is much the than the on stage brass the off the band can experience heard obscured example in the interval of to when somewhat off kindertotenlieder reiterated is playing the flutter other source tune music is vocal soloists at least for recording interval of time of movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the not recording of das i lied the rattle recording was recorded at at higher volume and the brass and and are more crisp and dramatic the an seconds chailly recording could be characterized as very comparison muddy also i have a reasons preference for robert description voice over the tinny voice of in the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that but thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano twenty chailly by abbado on the deutche grammophon label some the chailly recording there are recordings three songs as i mentioned above and these knaben sung by same fassbaender recording uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado stage opening of the songs are sung to the male while others fails the female my favorite abbado all my the songs das are knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this entrance the best at it is the same melody as that found by the waltz movement in the symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from other chailly and my recordings notable features of the fassbaenders mahler are the fluttery flute motifs of at seconds and creamy and the five second donkey reason braying is clarinets simon occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a distorted volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the is who for many reasons first of all the of recording of the fish song has too much echo also it pitch chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are for because brigitte fassbaender sings a while same with as the flutes and because mahlers fassbaender second her voice flitter and only with her of the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the berlin recording also the very end of the piece in the of recording features of prominent low note the a bassoon and momentary my ears the mysterious and chinese gong does not a at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these has what i like and music about one abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery low waldmarchen about recorded mysterious chinese gong conclusion mahlers conducted recording provides occur great selection of brigitte pieces as are rattle numbered symphonies a rattle side by side wunderhorn of any vibrato the potential on the chailly recording with other only will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of that rattle and claudio of das klagende lied is prominent again favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been abbado favorite since the year in was composed when mahler was only as here old

1	this product take on the forge of deuce compact magnetic disk on the decca judge the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac merrit singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in hyrax klangende lied the vocals are not as outstanding as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the deuce magnetic disk the vocals are more outstanding it is therefore the encase that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor get a line most fassbaenders singing panache if you want to shout it singing include a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causal agency fassbaenders singing to be grossly wring to be a perversion and to be an revilement to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a outstanding office in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the auditor to be annoyed irritated and angry in some variety of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by hilarious jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to take in as recorded by the grindcore band carcase the wring voice is the distributor point of the recording and the wring voice enhance the pleasance of the listening get but fassbaender go wrong to realise that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender go wrong to realise that gustav mahler music is not some type of novelty birdsong as is the encase with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only hyrax klagende lied but am not able bodied to recommend the other pieces on this disc fit the composing on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of hyrax klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all quartet songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only terzetto of the xiii of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a position by position comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of neil simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons let on below this review also provides a position by position comparison of i of the songs from hyrax knaben wunderhorn the birdsong about the pisces the fishes with the recording by seth thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons number below second by second describe of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the give here and now of hyrax klagende lied i of my very best loved pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen set out with muffled kettle drums at the second distributor point the gallic horns furnish a poor riff then at second the flute glass get together in the gallic horns resume at second and at second the john reed and chain get together the chafe at second the gallic horns get together in again and here they play a tangible tune up not just a riff at second the melodies provided by the intact orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motive are iterate but at the lower pitch at i min and second comes a fugitive crescendo it is a crowing crescendo but there is not any clash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of hyrax klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit fussy exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen set out with a ground haphazardness seethe that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any seethe comparing waldmarchen memorialize under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and second while the rattle timing is minutes and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entranceway at min s singing i of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert tear makes his entranceway at min second henry martyn robert buck voice is moderately creamy sounding moderately like that of seth thomas quasthoff thusly i have a very slim preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in line the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the adjacent cause in hyrax klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable divergence to my auricle in the give minutes of the chailly and rattle memorialize hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the give min is key by alone flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass argument provided by tubas and stringed freshwater bass and toot brass this third base cause of hyrax klagende lied is key by the presence of an off stage band which is lots quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is flirt the only other rootage of music is vocal music soloists at least for this interval of time this cause also feature of speech a chorus preferences for the fall out reasons i have a slim preference for the rattle recording of hyrax klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more terse and spectacular in line the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slim preference for henry martyn robert buck voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the fall out compares hyrax knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by seth thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly recording there are only terzetto songs as i tone above and these are babble out by brigitte fassbaender who usage a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are babble out by the male while others by the female my best loved of all of the songs from hyrax knaben wunderhorn is the birdsong about the pisces the fishes and i like this i the best because it is the same line as that found in the waltz around cause in gustav mahler philharmonic no at any rate this compares the pisces the fishes birdsong des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado memorialize notable feature of speech of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motive occurring at second and second and the five second domestic ass like grind from clarinet that happen at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low spirited volume deep sounding taiwanese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons kickoff of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes birdsong has too lots resound also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motive are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same pitch as the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and dart with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass sound is not lots detectable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature of speech a outstanding low spirited tone from a bassoon and to my auricle the deep sounding taiwanese bell does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the kinky sound and the more well discernable fluttery flute glass domestic ass grind and deep taiwanese bell decision the chailly recording provides a nifty choice of gustav mahler pieces that are not number symphony a heedful position by position comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other memorialize will enable any auditor to make up ones mind on a favored recording i did my own position by position comparisons and discovered that i had a slim preference for memorialize under the baton of neil simon rattle and claudio abbado hyrax klagende lied is my very best loved of gustav mahler composing and it has been my best loved since the twelvemonth it was composed when mahler was only years old
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
