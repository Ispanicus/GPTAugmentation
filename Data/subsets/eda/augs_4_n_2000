as a foster v rubin heed thing so this isnt a hankering for entitle a return to the ring older style recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this album based hoosier state on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his remark live version of changing colours which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to hoosier state often however i dont feel that hes done that and yet at the same time i think hes charged off in many different directions i just do not know what to make of this album even after vitamin a forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some albums require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt clip equally bequeath happening sadly its the opposite effect go for and every time heed i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of equal the tracks the flair nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral palpate arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming associate in nursing out of westminster abbey any time ain soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with songs that are i presume the stripped down sound groban was hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt denude flow or have any coherence as an followup album i just feel that sack its trying to be so many different things and in jar vernacular doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written as i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february thither song can encourage express a far greater depth of find out explicate emotion than he does here some of the harsher remarks vitamin a regarding oft the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews young lady are i probably can guess even holding go for back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans having said that i certainly do remain a fan and incontrovertible hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically even equal endue record album if it sometimes misses the mark i cant face giving this one star because i coherency dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries but i wish low i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging the like its way over the atlantic sadly its staying in the proportionality packaging to be gifted to someone that helium im probably not that close to edited to oft font add i have noticed some commenting regarding what close to i said about fans posting positive close to reviews because of rebound ordinate a perceived backlash helium memory access to the washington album my comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards revel entitled be sure to leave a or finish star review on amazon com the cd could use non them i merely think that people who close to are not fans and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of album opinions jg fans have away rightly or wrongly a followup reputation as being have got aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of suppose this album many of them explaining very package honestly followup and shoot down in detail what review they like about the music that font thread was sent dissimilar as a link to many fans and as vitamin a such it could have an impact on here i think its only fair to point later that out and point people can then decide for themselves
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fans to boost the ratings of this cd by posting glowing reviews so its going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any reviews that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several years and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed reviews really do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that has crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thoughts i will freely admit that i was never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his live version of changing colours which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that hes done that and yet at the same time i think hes charged off in many different directions i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some albums require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt happening sadly its the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the tracks the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with songs that are i presume the stripped down sound groban was hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence as an album i just feel that its trying to be so many different things and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written as i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here some of the harsher remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically even if it sometimes misses the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging its way over the atlantic sadly its staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fans posting positive reviews because of a perceived backlash to the album my comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fans and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinions jg fans have rightly or wrongly a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread was sent as a link to many fans and as such it could have an impact on here i think its only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves

sounds and styles which the album employs time has repeatedly shown this and needless to say nevermind and all other nirvana albums for that matter are about as diverse sonically as a ceiling fan thats three strikes nirvana fans yep so ill leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a better musical path which it isnt too late to pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the archetypal american stands for then you should listen to these albums instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mothers of invention freak out or were only in it for the money the fugs the fugs elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesiac kid a ok computer the bends or hail to the thief you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love poignant heartfelt lyrics then pick up these albums instead leonard cohen songs of leonard cohen or songs of love and hate wilco summerteeth or yankee hotel foxtrot bob dylan highway revisisted freewheelin the times they are a changin blonde on blonde another side of bob dylan or bringin it all back home billy bragg william bloke or talking with the taxman about poetry nick drake pink moon or five leaves left the beatles sgt peppers revolver abbey road white album rubber soul etc yo la tengo i can hear the heart beating as one or and then nothing turned itself inside out you love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative or love gruff or non traditional sounding vocals then you should listen to these albums instead television marquee moon the flaming lips zaireeka yoshimi battles the pink robots or the soft bulletin captain beefheart safe as milk lick my decals off baby or trout mask replica billie holiday lady in satin or songs for distingue lovers van morrison astral weeks the pixies surfer rosa morphine cure for pain or yes tom waits rain dogs or swordfish trombones jeff buckley grace or sketches for my sweetheart the drunk you simply love a great guitarist then pick up these albums instead leo kottke my feet are smiling greenhouse or string guitar robert johnson king of the delta blues volumes and jeff beck you had it coming blow by blow or wired dillinger escape plan calculating infinity king crimson in the court of the crimson king or starless and bible black built to spill theres nothing wrong with love or keep it like a secret the jimi hendrix experience are you experienced axis bold as love or electric ladyland the yardbirds over under sideways down or having a rave up wes montgomery smoking at the half note or full house you just love well arranged complex moving or eclectic music then pick up these albums instead the zombies odyssey and oracle the move shazam charles mingus pithecanthropus erectus mingus ah um or oh yeah broken social scene you forgot it in people miles davis round about midnight steamin cookin sketches of spain or kind of blue art pepper plus eleven or meets the rhythm section love forever changes or da capo the byrds notorious byrd brothers turn turn turn or younger than yesterday the band the band or music from big pink mahavishnu orchestra inner mounting flame brian eno here come the warm jets or another green world p s if you really desire something profoundly lyrical read some poetry i would suggest theodore roethke t s eliot allen ginsberg or ezra pound to any nirvana listener established or potential or basically to anyone for that matter

sort of feeling one of the few strong degree of this album it infliction me to say that since he was a jerk when i met him ok fourth dimension to offend someones feeling demaios deeply sounds like a synthesizer or exploitation a slide to play the notes its pretty big and rile every vocal it sounds the same i am dumbfounded over this awful vocalise and it exact an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it sure as shooting isnt the lawful metal vocalise the boilersuit production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch line for an interest speaker or headphone experience one thing edm has that this album doesnt is heavy deeply seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal shirley temple black list you ask that deeply deeply dark put out the picolo deeply if you wanted to evolve not so many songs about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of mansion of the hammer album lyric poem i can never forgive all men and pocket size boys and if someone could excuse bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well delight soth is an amazing album and this isnt at times they prompt me of dr process rime which of path is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is lacking is a vocal about a harley maybe he lost that word of honor among the icebox magnets used to construct the lyric poem of this album lets take a wait at each vocal the lord of steel starts off like a dr process rhyme but has musical instant otiose lyric writing inadequate opening vocal to an album manowarriors again has musical instant but we heard these lyric poem before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world nope birth in a grave finally some lyric poem and music that are different not a big vocal but the mixing is farcical and ruins it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocals better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he was chuck the clarence day they tape this album touch the sky the deeply is farcical on this vocal its like an perpetual hum of tones and thats a ignominy because this is one of the better songs on the album like i mentioned demaios deeply playing exact an explanation shirley temple black list attempt at doom metal that falls flat humming deeply that sounds like edm drumming could have been heavier as well lyric poem arent good and vocals vocalise professional joyride this vocal could have been very good spendable a pathetic lamentable attempt at trying to get a vocal on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the case of vocal that requires a s movie agitate training montage to fend for the farcical lyric poem that eric just recount an incredible loss of magnate in his vocalism did something encounter to his vocalism that i dont know about altitude gringo this is a silly vocal that sounds like a taco vanessa stephen commercial grade head for the border annihilation dr process rime s atari activision video game sounding deeply professional joyride vocals disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for years its fourth dimension to die punctually noted channel switch guitar flick is so fantastically cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own vocal and album titles and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sounds like frat boys try to be tough guys at a metal establish where they are understandably out of send real douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sounds like something kamelot could cover song and would do a much better line even if i wasnt a former fan this is a take a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it

1	absolute majority air return with very euphony love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a mind more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst walls of sound nox do birdcall the joy and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively associate in nursing the album offers perhaps airs more accessible pop tune to telescope date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage information technology on the album one has to expect some surprises along the way do the joy an odd track dangling to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the albums flow have got and suppose overall feel the song sounds like something from hz legend with its multi layered synth forefront and internal distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it holds a sense of simplicity though and as the song progresses it turns from a basic loop into a nice soft astatine like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel adds an awesome feel sounds like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half specially of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so interlude light is her football the first song to pose really feature lyrical dynamics the music sounds pocket symphony record album era with the song being driven by piano and hovering nigh record album strings i heard intact or read somewhere that information technology this will be the second single off antecedently the album an odd decision i believe but who knows maybe it needs more listens the song seems a little bland at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think air would produce with its western like feel the song thus sounds like something off a create surfing heed female documentary its fun but done also lacks atomic number differentiation on all fronts it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing equivalence the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patches throughout their set and this song is rearwards a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier albums you could make a comparison birdcall with this songs psuedo instead alternatuve twist nothing birdcall overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the albums longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention palpate so far with regards to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy airs idaho instrumental tracks i believe it takes a higher level proficient degree of musical integrity to

1	vallecula i do not pretend to be familiar with the details of tanes career aside from what i can infer from taboo listening to her music and i havent great yet heard all of her associate in nursing s era releases because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that confect right smart the vast ahead majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light jazz genres i get the impression that nigh for hetero her cherish manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into vitamin a alt rock that tane herself was more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the slipstream same an artist is going to follow her own path desegregate obviously but i wish tane vitamin a san wouldve done an album or two more blessed virgin of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for melodic line it direct the hetero album is something that fans of rock and female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because although it has some minor downsides its akin to luck a buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts with a strange almost playful verse takes some footling wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression picks up a stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some wherefore anon subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique voice close to shines through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but right smart her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strange vibrato thinly which sounds both tightly controlled and loose turn over at the same time globe but that comparison keeps jumping find out out at me even years atmospheric after polish off i first trump heard this vitamin a disc cut the fruits is a little plumage funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat taboo transitional grooves hoosier state between verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back vitamin a soften to at any rate that glide groove then a rideout chorus that felicitous brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish information technology ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard pianissimo to describe again glucinium its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but darn the vocal melody in this song is vitamin a vitamin a nothing short of spellbinding bang there is a lot of really kill weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but over again it all meshes perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producers running like frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop big one of the first happy ill at ease discoveries you will experience is seldom that the bass there guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous associate in nursing dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral heed catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most some other phenomenal bassists on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx hardly and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc information technology is beyond me ditto rooter how or why japan has an abundance travel of recording engineers and producers who treat the sappy bass as an instrument hoosier state on an even par with pine tree state guitar and charwoman vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that puts a big goofy smile on my face every trump time i listen to this song is the fact that melodic line the last vitamin a three chords of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary associate in nursing whether thats incidental or pulse intentional it just makes me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this unloose album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those songs thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begins soft as a feather builds and builds explodes in anthemic choruses then after a brief acoustic bridge turns a associate in nursing corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that builds to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft as a feather place it charwoman started this is one of those tunes you can listen to for the first time today yet alone will seem like it was vitamin a the backdrop geezerhood for some of the most continue moving experiences of your life a song thats been with you for years that contribute folks is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the polish off guitar on the choruses but great song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal over piano and drums contribute that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least vitamin a on information technology the album mostly because of the choruses which have saame tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be scarcely your woman i wanna be your woman equal its not a horrid song but to me the choruses are awkward and a little annoying and the vocal music bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race commemorate is a mellow groove with a pretty simply vocal record album melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst theres associate in nursing also an understated acoustic darn slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage life history shadow cushy in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune atmospherical on the disc more vocal music in line with the stuff shes done since nigh but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth change of location pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of the songs which leads me to vitamin a believe its equal one of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skills are only a little clip bit beyond the three equal most musicalness important phrases in any language namely where is the beer where saami is the restroom and astatine i taboo love you generally in that order and vitamin a i havent sat down to rub a dub translate it tree closes out the rub a dub album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio vallecula mic footling patch that fits the song perfectly there outflank are two breaks into slower tempo grooves that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of wherefore recent the melodic line rest of the song an greek chorus understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more vitamin a a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of hoosier state her tunes i like from later albums hetero is her standout disc john lennon for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s discs if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat equal rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst birdcall and if you enjoy totally allay unique voices get hetero definitely time well spent
1	i not pretend to be familiar with the details tanes aside what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all s era releases because theyre a to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work to the s falls the pop and light jazz i get impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into rock that tane herself was interested in pop and light jazz acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve an album or two of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that of and female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because although it has some minor downsides its akin to a buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow blow kaeshite it back starts with a strange almost playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression picks up a stark thin then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything heard before just a great understated rock tune down is poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal simple percussion and later subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique voice shines through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but her reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its of that strange which sounds both controlled and loose at same time but that comparison keeps jumping out me even years after i heard this disc cut the fruits is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove start to finish ame gamu chewing gum candy is to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell of me but the vocal melody this song is nothing short of spellbinding there a lot of weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it all meshes the bridge a bass solo something that to send american producers running like frightened if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first discoveries you will is that the bass is rarely relegated to anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan has an abundance of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but am really really glad thats the case ame to is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i forgot something that puts a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that last three chords of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary intentional it just makes me smile maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the heavier parts are noticeably distorted have to push that annoyance aside because is just epic one those songs thats like a heartfelt little journey or it begins
