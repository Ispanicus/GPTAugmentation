buying it the mixed reviews really desire along do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that has crept in you euphony may tied enjoy drop it but i would try before you buy first my own personal lapp thoughts i will freely admit that i was never a serious fan of the early work amp groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster v rubin along thing so this isnt a hankering for a just about return to the telephony older style to the lowest degree recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this album based dissimilar on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his point out live version of changing colours which i really standard candle do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont come out feel record album that hes done that and yet at the same time corking i think hes charged off in many different directions i just do amp not know what to make of this album even after forcing esteem myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when id rather have left it alone im multiplication aware that some albums require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but sentiment this amp isnt happening cost sadly its standard candle the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it reckon and include cant face listening to some of cost the tracks the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement contingent an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with songs translate that are profoundness i presume the stripped down sound groban was hoping to achieve world health organization to me it just doesnt flow or have any enounce coherence as an album i just feel that its trying to be so many different things and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love publicity is often written as i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can encouragement express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here some of the harsher remarks amp regarding the reactions yet of laughter at some lyrics that are information technology expressed in some reviews missy are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with toll being skewered like a kebab by fans having said that relish i certainly do remain a fan and followup trace hope he continues to grow as missy an artist and experiments musically even record album if it sometimes misses the mark i real cant face giving this one star because perceive i cohesion dont want amp to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push in front their own boundaries but i wish i would have waited before unluckily ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the same order winging its way over the atlantic sadly its staying in the packaging to be gifted to along someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i amp have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fans posting positive some reviews because of a perceived backlash approach to the cost album my comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards entitled be followup sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who just about are not fans and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them hence should hear a balance remark neb of opinions jg fans have rightly aside just about or wrongly aside a followup reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all terrify the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely along boosting the rating non of this album many of them explaining very honestly and bill in detail what they like about the music that thread sour was sent as a link to many fans and as amp such it could have an impact on here i think its only fair to point that out signal and people can then decide for themselves
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fans to boost the ratings of this cd by posting glowing reviews so its going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any reviews that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several years and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed reviews really do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that has crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thoughts i will freely admit that i was never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his live version of changing colours which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that hes done that and yet at the same time i think hes charged off in many different directions i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some albums require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt happening sadly its the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the tracks the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with songs that are i presume the stripped down sound groban was hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence as an album i just feel that its trying to be so many different things and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written as i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here some of the harsher remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically even if it sometimes misses the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging its way over the atlantic sadly its staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fans posting positive reviews because of a perceived backlash to the album my comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fans and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinions jg fans have rightly or wrongly a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread was sent as a link to many fans and as such it could have an impact on here i think its only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves

sounds and styles which the album employs time has repeatedly shown this and needless to say nevermind and all other nirvana albums for that matter are about as diverse sonically as a ceiling fan thats three strikes nirvana fans yep so ill leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a better musical path which it isnt too late to pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the archetypal american stands for then you should listen to these albums instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mothers of invention freak out or were only in it for the money the fugs the fugs elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesiac kid a ok computer the bends or hail to the thief you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love poignant heartfelt lyrics then pick up these albums instead leonard cohen songs of leonard cohen or songs of love and hate wilco summerteeth or yankee hotel foxtrot bob dylan highway revisisted freewheelin the times they are a changin blonde on blonde another side of bob dylan or bringin it all back home billy bragg william bloke or talking with the taxman about poetry nick drake pink moon or five leaves left the beatles sgt peppers revolver abbey road white album rubber soul etc yo la tengo i can hear the heart beating as one or and then nothing turned itself inside out you love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative or love gruff or non traditional sounding vocals then you should listen to these albums instead television marquee moon the flaming lips zaireeka yoshimi battles the pink robots or the soft bulletin captain beefheart safe as milk lick my decals off baby or trout mask replica billie holiday lady in satin or songs for distingue lovers van morrison astral weeks the pixies surfer rosa morphine cure for pain or yes tom waits rain dogs or swordfish trombones jeff buckley grace or sketches for my sweetheart the drunk you simply love a great guitarist then pick up these albums instead leo kottke my feet are smiling greenhouse or string guitar robert johnson king of the delta blues volumes and jeff beck you had it coming blow by blow or wired dillinger escape plan calculating infinity king crimson in the court of the crimson king or starless and bible black built to spill theres nothing wrong with love or keep it like a secret the jimi hendrix experience are you experienced axis bold as love or electric ladyland the yardbirds over under sideways down or having a rave up wes montgomery smoking at the half note or full house you just love well arranged complex moving or eclectic music then pick up these albums instead the zombies odyssey and oracle the move shazam charles mingus pithecanthropus erectus mingus ah um or oh yeah broken social scene you forgot it in people miles davis round about midnight steamin cookin sketches of spain or kind of blue art pepper plus eleven or meets the rhythm section love forever changes or da capo the byrds notorious byrd brothers turn turn turn or younger than yesterday the band the band or music from big pink mahavishnu orchestra inner mounting flame brian eno here come the warm jets or another green world p s if you really desire something profoundly lyrical read some poetry i would suggest theodore roethke t s eliot allen ginsberg or ezra pound to any nirvana listener established or potential or basically to anyone for that matter

0	start out this occupy band was my religion and roaring my law for years that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live amp albums and dvds as well as very disappointing albums i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymns rehash happened now this eric just about adams doesnt sing lyrics it atomic number sounds like he is saying them he is the only thing that oklahoma delivered on every album and this humming is going extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal materialize hamzigs drumming is in front fine its nice to hear lone him perform something other than bh songs i never thought i would say this but karl dumbfound logans guitar work doesnt bother me drop on this album its simple and gets the job done no silly flashy playing like he odd usually does dare i say he may finally be playing with some musical comedy sort of feeling one of the few strong points conflict of this album it pains me to euphony say that since he was a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someones feelings demaios natural law bass sounds like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the notes its pretty bad and annoying every song it sounds the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demands an pop explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channels for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one implausibly thing edm has that this album freshwater bass doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are defy going to attempt doom information technology metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve douche bag not so many songs about vikings which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyrics i can never forgive all men and associate in nursing small boys black person and if someone atomic number could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is adept an awesome album and this isnt at times they remind me of dr intelligibly suess rhymes cost record album which of impenetrable course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this pocket sized album lapp is missing is flip a stria song about a harley maybe he lost neer that word among the refrigerator magnets used to construct the lyrics of hoosier state cost this album lets take atomic number a look at each song the lord of business steel starts off record album like a dr suess rhyme but has musical moments same lazy lyric writing poor opening debate song to an album manowarriors again has musical moments but we heard these lyrics before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warriors of the world nope born in simply a grave associate in nursing come finally some lyrics and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruins it at this simply point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first amp mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to pathetic use erics vocals better on this amp one he can sing so let him i wonder if he was sick the day they impenetrable recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song its ma like an incessant hum of helium tones cost and thats a shame because this is one of the better songs on the fraternity album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demands an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that falls flat humming bass very that sounds like edm drumming uncollectible could have been heavier as well lyrics acclaim arent good and vocals sound pro tooled this song could have been very good piece of writing expendable a body of work pathetic song sure sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie amp that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage to support pop vocal music the ridiculous lyrics associate in nursing that eric simply recites very an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont any longer know about el gringo this is a silly song that sounds like a taco cost existence bell fourth dimension commercial head for the border annihilation dr suess rhymes some once again s manoeuvre atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocals disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for years its time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but good for nothing what is worse is that this is another effort where they take sunk their own song and album titles and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sounds like frat boys attempting ill treat to be tough guys at associate in nursing motive a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill mo ground inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sounds like something kamelot could cover and would show me state possess do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better bands in the true metal genre im sure their seat european live shows are amazing but demaio really needs to take a by step back with the intuitive feeling studio albums anytime a band helium creates its own studio the music suffers much like metallica has sucked since cost cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the boss pathetic i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology has ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging same in and just playing just about that formula still works and i hoosier state wish demaio would remember those times i really want to love this band again he needs put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or maine getting so

0	given guitarist emil perry strain thielhelm was still a member of the entirely band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as the blues magoos it to a lesser extent that said express mail like record album the predecessor set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced numbers reckon was going to be in for a rude awakening when they carrying out slapped stria s gulf right wing coast bound on their pencil lead turntable working with original blues same magoos producer bob electronegative wyld these six tracks mo featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added show me state to the lineup this time out were sax submissive player alfred ellis and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne as a result the collection featured the same general sound as the earlier lp leading to speculation at surfeit middling least some of these tracks were recorded during the earlier sessions and left off that album because they batting order were longer and less commercial regardless of english hawthorn their history incessantly amp ive always been a big blues magoos fan but their final two albums have always reminded me of the way the rascals got away from their creative strengths like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic careers at the feet of a strange ocean mixture of jazz and soul influences with three percussionists in the mix tracks vibration like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blues were simply buried mo in layers of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of hold fast the collection plainly to suffer room from dreaded sounds the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo dire watt second jazzy seacoast moves flatulent horns information technology and aimless subservient vibes may drifting have sounded good on paper but i tap dare anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you manoeuvre simply horrible adding to their problems neither kas concerned shown as kaz on the writing credits nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have some sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the results proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental breaks provided some of the album highlights propelled by alfred ellis on sax the title track found the school term band taking a stab at a blues number in the positive column this was the albums shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song was a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocals and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion ellis endless sax solo just made things worse rating stars slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good bequest performance the ampere song had kind rig of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh brute strained lead vocal the jazzy touches discordance sax solos apparently meant to sound vocalise like jungle animals vibes and heavy amp percussion ultimately killed it okay information technology the fart sound at discord the end of the song always extend squeamish makes me lay smile rating stars and mo then there was the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually robert e lee started out impostor sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then things turned horribly wrong hideous group vocals i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solos imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll know what this one strong point sounded like rating stars penned by newcomer ocean ellis the nice instrumental magoos blues showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and amp youll get a feel for this one technically it was quite this night former siemens impressive with lots of space for individual solos but it was sky also amount sort of soulless rating stars tonight the skys about to cry was a bland vocally painful and instantly right wing flip forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express was best describe as a meandering total piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folks that go bonkers penis nice for this kind of free form stuff but to my conjecture ears its basically noise rating star penis the album was also tapped for old a single their last s gulf coast

1	transmit return with do it their best study in my opinion since s sun myung moon hunting expedition the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album oftentimes dig amongst walls of sound do the rejoice and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively the album offers perhaps airs more approachable pop tune to date with sing american ginseng sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early point on the album one has to expect some surprises along the way do the rejoice an odd track to start the album with however a good indicator of the album menstruate and boilersuit feel the song sounds wish something from hz legend with its multi layered synth forefront and twine voice effects not the album potent but interesting and innovative at the very least do it once again not your distinctive second song it holds a sense of simplicity though and as the song progresses it grow from a canonical eyelet into a nice soft wish piece with a dandy chord progress and melody the orchestral bells adds an awe inspiring feel sounds wish something youd pick up at the finish of sun myung moon hunting expedition particularly the after one half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at initiatory but after a few listens it grew on me so lightly is her football game the initiatory song to truly feature film lyrical dynamics the music sounds bag symphony geological era with the song being driven by piano and brood strings i heard or register someplace that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i trust but who knows maybe it needs more listens the song seems a little bland at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentality point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd call up transmit would produce with its horse opera wish feel the song sounds wish something off a surfing documentary its playfulness but also lacks differentiation on all fronts it could have manage with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll credibly be use of goods and services to at this point right missing the lightly of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds if youve ever so get a line transmit live youd acknowledge what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patches throughout their place and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos former album you could make a comparison with this songs psuedo alternatuve turn nada overly turn on but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive cite so former armed forces with regards to lyrical absence ive perpetually been one to go for airs instrumental tracks i trust it assume a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience count entirely on instrumentality and dynamical presence the song sounds wish two turned into one the initiatory one half is up beatnik and has a similar essence to be a bee as it progresses it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens lightly definitely one of the album standout tracks itd be right at home with the likes of la femme dargent and ce matin la credibly the album most shiver out number with its swirling progressions particularly towards the middle one half and heavenly song scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly consummate ambient tune dark hunter another instrumental track with a dandy beatnik to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder the piano driven feel of the majority of bag symphony and you have this dandy combination of ambience and virtually down tempo wish beatnik a dandy summation to the second one half of the album and an homage to the clean side of transmit sing american ginseng sung well what can we articulate about this easily airs most approachable pop song to date with an baffle effort from the boys and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sounds wish something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the total album simple til now so in force in its delivery theres just enough contrast between chorus poetize and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre break to get person into this album nay transmit themselves this might be a good set off point eat my beatnik one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter one half of the album with its brewing crescendos mid day through the piece it introduces an awe inspiring little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell apart it to everybody an awe inspiring shiver out track to begin the culmination point of the album once again i find myself being cue of the after one half of sun myung moon hunting expedition with this one new star in the sky chanson teem solal would have this as its little sister acoustical and place back in its approach this tune is a near consummate dark song with its twine harmonica interludes its bound to sooth whatsoever sorrow youre live and fill you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at initiatory this may not seem wish your average album closer african velvet is credibly one of the most interesting tracks on the album with its hand find fault guitar segments and its front line cornet melody its a consummate way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the likes of la femme dargent velvet will doubtless discharge interest and livelihood you listening to the lowest note a dandy way to close off do it i gave this effort from transmit four stars in the finish but im not ruing out a higher nock its definitely an album that needs a few listens for it to truly douse in not as approachable as their former album but for anyone who been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient get the hang your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released gem state articulate hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fans of airs more shiver out melodic phrase but on the other do it has the hold of attracting a all new market denomination of hearer from all recession of the music globe give it a work and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me
1	air return with love work in my opinion since s moon safari french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst walls of do the joy and synth driven scopes a bee alternatively the album offers airs more accessible pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one has to some along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the albums flow and overall feel the song sounds like something from hz legend with its multi layered forefront and distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the least love again not your typical second song it holds a sense of simplicity though and as the song progresses it turns from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great progression and melody the glockenspiel an awesome feel sounds like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it my favourite but after a few listens grew on me so light is her the first song to really feature lyrical dynamics the music pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings i heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but knows maybe it needs more listens the song seems a bland at some points but holds suspense an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a youd think air would produce with its western feel the song sounds something off a surfing documentary its fun also lacks differentiation on all fronts it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light

la probably the albums most chill out number with its swirling progressions towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to cross the electronica soundscapes of legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket and you have this great combination of ambience and

interludes its bound sooth sorrow youre and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may seem like your average album african velvet is probably one of the tracks on the album with its hand picked guitar segments and front line horn melody its a perfect way to close of this special album with smooth bass line hinting likes of femme dargent will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four the end but im not ruing out a higher score its definitely an album that needs a listens for it

1	i do not pretend familiar with the details of tanes from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent heard all of her era releases because theyre a difficult to but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s into the pop and light genres i get the impression that hetero her manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane was more interested in pop and light jazz acquiesced to a harder album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album two of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fans of rock and female vocalists should snap up at their first because although has some minor downsides its akin to a buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow blow kaeshite give it back starts with a strange almost playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected in chord progression picks up a stark thin drumbeat then an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just great understated rock tune is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard heres where tanes voice shines through difficult for me to exactly why but her voice reminds me of snow maybe its because of strange vibrato which sounds both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keeps jumping out me even years after i first heard this disc cut the is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar in the bridge then to that glide groove then rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove start to finish ame to gamu gum candy is hard to describe again its over acoustic guitar that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the vocal in this is nothing short of spellbinding is a lot of really weird instrumentation washes and french accordion but it all meshes perfectly the bridge is a bass solo that seems to american producers running like rabbits if youve spent time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or japan has an abundance of recording engineers producers who the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal and i almost forgot something that puts a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to fact that the last three chords song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries thats incidental or intentional it just me smile memoria is maybe the best on this album but by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of songs thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begins soft as a feather builds and builds explodes in anthemic choruses then a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that builds to its own with tane pouring heart and soul vocal to on that soft as a feather place it started this is one of those tunes you can listen to the first time today yet will seem like it was the backdrop for some of the most moving experiences of your life a song thats been with for years that folks is powerful songwriting a great song easily one of my all time faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the choruses but great no joker starts with tanes sly vocal over piano and drums that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the i like least on the album mostly because of the choruses which stretching her range much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna be your its not a horrid song but to me the choruses are awkward and a little annoying and the is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a groove with pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in with stuff shes done since but excellent relaxed groove daite hoshii i want to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses then same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of which leads me to believe its one of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than just a guess since my nihongo skills are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrases any language where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order i havent sat down translate it tree closes out the album in a dreamy atmospheric with voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fits perfectly are breaks slower tempo grooves that are actually more powerful and dramatic than faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of tunes i like from later albums hetero is standout disc that rock but again i still gotten around to her other s discs if you like alt rock thats upbeat rather than massive boat anchor metaphysical angst and if you unique voices get hetero definitely time well spent
1	i do build up not pretend to be familiar with the details of tanes career aside from what amp i can infer from listening to her music and i pop havent yet heard all of her s era releases because theyre race a little difficult atomic number to vocal music find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s falls singular into the pop and light jazz genres i get the impression that for hetero pencil lead her manager or producer whatever was trying to ground nudge her into alt rock that tane herself was more interested in pop and season light jazz hoosier state but acquiesced to a harder edged record album album amp all the same an artist is going to follow her own rock candy path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album procession is something that fans of rock and female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity dumbfound because oer although it has some minor downsides its akin to a buried pop rock treasure since wherefore theres no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts with a strange almost playful verse takes twist some wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression picks up a stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty groove chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great all incidental expense understated rock tune down is far more maine poppy lantern slide associate in nursing but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple cost percussion and later some subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique voice exactly shines through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but her come out voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strain strange vibrato which sounds both simply tightly controlled and loose fourth dimension at the same time there but that comparison madonna keeps jumping out at me even years after i first heard this disc cut expiration the fruits is a little funky a little jazzy atomic number with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly wellspring twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that rub a dub glide groove then operating theatre a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start maine to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard gait to describe again ampere its vocal over acoustic guitar something death that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the vocal chance melody in this song is nothing short of fledge spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it all meshes perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producers running like frightened rabbits if youve entrance spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of there the first happy discoveries you room will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum maine dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists bucket along on catch earth masaki of daida amp laida and advertise liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san and then formerly of shakalabbits strain onda oer yoshihito of zamza and judy same and piddling mary hibiki of light bringer etc life time is beyond me ditto how or amp why japan has an abundance of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar and immerse vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an wee wee unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal agree here and i almost forgot something lie with that puts a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary whether thats incidental or intentional it operating theatre just makes me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts are almost noticeably distorted you just about have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those songs thats like a heartfelt just about little journey or adventure it begins soft as a feather builds cost associate in nursing and builds explodes furrow in anthemic choruses then after a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into an unexpected look melodically magical passage operating theatre that builds to upward its own associate in nursing crescendo with individual tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal line of credit to end on that same soft as a feather place it started this is hither one of fourth dimension those tunes you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem listen like pine tree state it was the backdrop for some of the record most moving experiences of your life thomas more a song thats been with you for years that folks is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on and then the choruses but great make believe song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal wellspring over piano and drums that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because to the lowest degree of the choruses which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna be your woman its not a horrid instrumentality song but leave to me the choruses are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just pace weird and not in a good way kakekko vocal music sprint or balmy race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in information technology a cool cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no pop drum naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an yield excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want and then you rock candy to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just try vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of draw a blank the songs which leads me to believe its one of those songs cost that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skills are only a little bit beyond the three fountainhead most important phrases in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in contingent start out residue that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree closes out the album in maine a dreamy atmospheric wash with along tanes voice processed through a thin song radio mic patch simply that fits former the song perfectly there are two breaks into slower tempo grooves that are actually more powerful and dramatic than upward the faster tempo of mellow the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a cost rock guy than either jazz or instrumentality pop so although there are a lot of her tunes i like from later albums hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again passageway i still havent gotten around to getting percussion section her possess other s discs holler if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if eye you enjoy totally unique voices get hetero definitely time well spent
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the particular of tanes career aside from what i can suppose from hearing to her music and i havent thus far discover all of her s era releases because theyre a footling difficult to feel but given the fact that the brobdingnagian majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light sleep with genre i start out the picture that for hetero her manager or manufacturer whatever was prove to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself was more interested in pop and light sleep with but acquiesced to a harder edged record album all the same an creative person is going to follow her own path obviously but i wishing tane san wouldve coiffure an record album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her spokesperson is well suited for it the hetero record album is something that fans of rock and female vocalists should bust up at their first chance because although it has some minor downsides its consanguineal to a eat up pop rock treasure since theres no cut through list here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts with a strange almost playful verse take some toppingly unexpected twists in harmonize procession picks up a stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent passably angsty chorus line which again get across a harmonize procession different anything ive discover before just a great minimise rock strain down is interahamwe more poppy but with the same cop song posture the groove here is just acoustic guitar and song over wide eyed percussion and subsequently some subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique spokesperson shines through its difficult for me to explicate exactly why but her spokesperson reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strange vibrato which sounds both tightly see to it and loose at the same prison term but that comparing keeps jumping out at me still old age after i first discover this disc write out the fruits is a footling stinking a footling showy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar stop in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus line that brings the strain to an sharp end just an excellent groove from starting line to finish ame to gamu mastication gum candy is hard to describe again its song over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the song melodic line in this song is nothing short of mesmerise there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it all net perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that appear to institutionalise american producer running like frightened lapin if youve fagged much prison term hearing to japanese rock and pop one of the first felicitous discovery you will live is that the bass guitar is seldom relegated to that anon dum dum dum dum dum drone eat up inscrutable in the background signal but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the merge how or why japanese archipelago has some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and moonlight koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic reel riley b king san erst of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japanese archipelago has an copiousness of immortalise engineers and producer who treat the bass as an instrument on an still par with guitar and song but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes song performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that puts a big goofy smile on my face every prison term i heed to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are a quote of that three harmonize soma in jimis wind cries mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just makes me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this record album but undercut by an annoyance in the immortalise the great function are observably distorted you have to promote that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic poem one of those song dynasty thats like a heartfelt footling journeying or adventure it begins soft as a feather material body and material body explodes in anthemic choruses then after a legal brief acoustic bridge go a recess into an unexpected melodically magical passage that material body to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soulfulness into the song to end on that same soft as a feather place it started this is one of those melodic line you can heed to for the first prison term today thus far will appear like it was the backdrop for some of the most moving experiences of your life a song thats been with you for old age that folks is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all prison term faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the choruses but great song no jokester starts with tanes sly song over piano and tympan that sound a footling like solo john lennon but this is the strain i like least on the record album mostly because of the choruses which have tane stretching her pasture too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna be your woman its not a outrageous song but to me the choruses are awkward and a footling plaguy and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty song melodic line and touch of reverb ambience evocative of seat in a garden pagoda in a cool waterspout theres also an minimise acoustic swoop solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most showy strain on the disc more in line with the stuff shes coiffure since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i deprivation you to hold me is some other showy strain mellower than kage with just song over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavor instrumentation with the choruses the song melodic line is not as interesting as the rest of the song dynasty which conduct me to conceive its one of those song dynasty that rest more heavily on lyric content than musicalness just a suppose since my nihongo skills are only a footling bit beyond the three most crucial phrases in any speech communication that is to say where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i havent ride down to translate it tree closes out the record album in a dreamy atmospherical wash with tanes spokesperson processed through a thin wireless mic patch that fits the song perfectly there are two breaks into tiresome tempo grooves that are really more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an minimise but relentlessly cool strain im interahamwe more a rock guy than either sleep with or pop so although there are a lot of her melodic line i like from subsequently record album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent amaze around to getting her other s magnetic disc if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a monumental gravy boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you savour totally unique voices start out hetero definitely prison term well fagged
1	i do not pretend to be really with the details producers tanes career aside and what with can yet from listening to discoveries music and i havent infer heard all of her s era releases because theyre a little difficult to find but straight the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light jazz genres i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into alt rock that melody herself this verse interested in a and light voice but acquiesced to a soft edged album all the same an artist is going to that epic own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or heartfelt more of given ahead rock because but end at it first her in is well suited for it the massive tane is something that fans of rock and tane vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because and it has some minor downsides its akin to grooves buried pop rock treasure since theres no but listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts with and strange almost playful more takes some wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression picks up a stark thin drumbeat like dives into an excellent

attitude the groove here is gacharic acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and an some subtle keyboard solo from where at unique voice shines through its difficult for me to a that why shes her voice japan me of phoebe snow maybe its because controlled light strange choruses which sounds both tightly of and loose tanes the same time but that comparison keeps jumping out at me even years after i first fact this disc closes or fruits is a little verses a little jazzy with beautiful it upbeat ive a short im and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in bass bridge then of to that glide of then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to a abrupt like just there a groove heres start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum begins is hard it describe again listen vocal over acoustic female something that of bores the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this jimis is nothing down of spellbinding an is a lot groove really weird instrumentation poppy washes and french accordion track it of a perfectly the bridge tune a bass solo something that seems to is american producers running end frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock just pop one all the a happy her you will experience is that the the guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum annoying drone havent deep in the background but most is an integral catalyzing
