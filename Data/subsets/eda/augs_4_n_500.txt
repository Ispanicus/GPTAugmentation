0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress past sar label group a is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception countenance of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous credibly african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring drinking chocolate linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a succus little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a a good deal traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love drinking chocolate to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as tape annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all past the way through till the end personify other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even group a makes the impression hes on the distinguish phone speaking to the people of pianissimo niamey billet in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics whatever that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for inside song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate brilliant towards the end which uranium isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i medicine decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp cast downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough position not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by maine african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista indite in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to right their own thing therefore the point tusk is not information technology to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of hooter the songs in this amount album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been totally one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent ivory heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul song dynasty maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a

the end theres rich person also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn explain arrangements everything dress works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and past in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written astir by miguel for his conjnto matamros is oriental person an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the past reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar peradventure solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in internet explorer spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this file away backcloth reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the right one from the original vinyl trifle which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and advantageously which alone i happily transferred

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied clarinet the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender past is what the listener hears most possess fassbaenders singing style if you want to air call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders apply singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the tape potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume personify to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of air novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all tape blare by third base gustav mahler and they consist of das paul simon klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of indiana des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the tape baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one tape of the songs indiana from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is rattling slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides early a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the identical fray at seconds group a the french horns french people spectacular join song manlike in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute non and seconds totally comes pull a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende possess lied are essentially the same for the potential drop chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not lied with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the personify baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is personify minutes and seconds while the rattle information technology timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly get down recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his a good deal entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i personify have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and movement of holy warriors a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the group a baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording tenor voice clocks at while the rattle recording is the along opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed stylus basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied patch is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for substantially example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight tape preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the item rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and higher up the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight betimes preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and sound anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by admonition the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs unwrap at seconds and early again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all astatine the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice comparing flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in terms the chailly recording also the very end of instant the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low sure enough note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur bit at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and along prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies personify a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the personify chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and walk in claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and medicine it has been my favorite since the just year it bring together was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

1	this product takes the chassis of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester israel baline the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in dassie klangende lied the vocal are not as spectacular as the orchestral contribution but in all the other composition in the two discs the vocal are more spectacular it is consequently the case that in these other composition the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hears most fassbaenders sing style if you want to call it sing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this eccentric exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders sing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an contumely to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a spectacular role in any record it damages the record and has the potential to cause the hearer to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as immortalize by screaming jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as immortalize by the grindcore isthmus carcass the distorted voice is the point of the record and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to understand that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to understand that mahler

record come out with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly record the tenor werner hollweg establish his entrance at taiwanese sec sing peerless of the most beautiful melodies in the hellenic repertory mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle record the tenor robert tear establish his entrance at taiwanese seconds robert displume voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat wish that of thomas quasthoff gum olibanum i have a very slight preference for the rattle record for reasons nameless to me the chailly record has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass part andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle record has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in dassie klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly record clocks at while the rattle record is the opening minute is distinguished by unaccompanied tucket from the kettle drums a strong bass part line provided by tubas and thread basses and honk brass this third movement of dassie klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage isthmus which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage isthmus can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage isthmus is playing the only other reference of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also lineament a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle record of dassie klagende lied the rattle record was immortalize at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly record could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert displume voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares dassie knaben wunderhorn from the chailly record with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly record there are only three songs as i refer above and these are sing by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado record some of the songs are sing by the male while others by the female my preferent of all of the songs from dassie knaben wunderhorn is the song dynasty about the angle and i wish this peerless the best because it is the same melody as that notice in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compares the angle song dynasty des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings guiding light lineament of the abbado record are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey wish mash from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese chime i prefer the abbado record over the chailly record for many reasons first of all the chailly record of the angle song dynasty has too much echo also in the chailly record the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender establish her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much obtrusive in the chailly record also the very end of the piece in the chailly record lineament a spectacular low short letter from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese chime does not occur at the end of the chailly record to reiterate these points what i wish and prefer about the abbado record is the snappy sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey mash and mysterious chinese chime conclusion the chailly record put up a smashing selection of mahler composition that are not numbered symphonies a measured face by face comparability of any of the composition on the chailly record with other recordings will enable any hearer to adjudicate on a favored record i did my own face by face comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado dassie klagende lied is my very preferent of mahler compositions and it has been my preferent since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty age old
1	this product takes the work of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning involve fassbaender in das klangende lie the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral break but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is thus the case that in these other pieces the interpreter of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders interpreter has a prominent role in any show it damages the show and has the potential to cause the auditor to be annoyed irritated and angry in some work of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted interpreter is the point of the show and the distorted interpreter enhances the pleasure of the listening live but fassbaender fail to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fail to realize that mahler music is not some type of bauble birdcall as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lie but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lie kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only triad of the long dozen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same show under the baton of simon zelotes rattle the rattle show is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the birdcall about the fish with the show by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado show is slightly better for the reasons name below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lie one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muted kettleful drum at the second point the french people horns supply a short riff then at indorsement the flutes join in the french people horns take up at indorsement and at indorsement the reeds and twine join the fray at indorsement the french people horns join in again and here they play a real air not just a riff at indorsement the air provided by the integral orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one instant and indorsement comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle show this and other break of das klagende lie are fundamentally the same for the chailly show and for the rattle show with the nit picky exclusion that i leaning below the chailly show of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle show starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and indorsement while the rattle timing is minutes and indorsement in the chailly show the tenor werner hollweg stool his entrance at fukien sec singing one of the most beautiful air in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs interpreter is slightly cheesy in the rattle show the tenor robert displume stool his entrance at fukien indorsement robert tears interpreter is somewhat creamy vocalize somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very little penchant for the rattle show for reasons unknown to me the chailly show has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle show has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert displume and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lie is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly show clocks at while the rattle show is the opening instant is distinguished by alone tucket from the kettleful drum a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and claxon brass this third movement of das klagende lie is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is lots quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other seed of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a little penchant for the rattle show of das klagende lie the rattle show was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly show could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a little penchant for robert tears interpreter over the cheesy interpreter of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly show with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly show there are only triad songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who utilization a pronounced vibrato in the abbado show some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the birdcall about the fish and i like this one the undecomposed because it is the same line as that found in the valse movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compares the fish birdcall des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings noted features of the abbado show are the fluttery fluting motif occurring at indorsement and indorsement and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that happen at indorsement and again at indorsement the piece resolve with a low volume mysterious vocalize chinese gong i prefer the abbado show over the chailly show for many reasons first of all of all the chailly show of the fish birdcall has too lots replication also in the chailly show the fluttery fluting motif are veil because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender stool her interpreter flitter and flicker with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not lots noticeable in the chailly show also the very end of the piece in the chailly show features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious vocalize chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly show to ingeminate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado show is the crisper sound and the more well discernible fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly show provides a great selection of mahler pieces that are not numbered symphonies a measured side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly show with other recordings will enable any auditor to decide on a favored show i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a little penchant for recordings under the baton of simon zelotes rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lie is my very favorite of mahler compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only xx years old
