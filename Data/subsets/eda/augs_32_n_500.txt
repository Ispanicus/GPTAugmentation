0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was course an obvious intent trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a african singer on the front cover and including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap in the background which get on nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in also love

that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the

trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is medicine brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende while lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in embody these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you solitary want to lapplander call it singing includes a grossly flap exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be past grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on inward you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass da the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type make of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell vocalize on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but group a am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav second mahler and compare they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under past the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account bring home the bacon of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening seth thomas moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french wand horns compare resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play somewhat a real tune not just a information technology riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo while but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are flap for the rattle recording solitary this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same tonal pattern for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise happen hum da that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings rattling under the baton of chailly and inward rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds thither in the chailly recording the bespeak tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny motive in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear atomic number makes his entrance at min seconds embody robert tears flunk voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight favor preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to wand me the separate chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der fluting speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the seth thomas chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by record tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of embody das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of days to trend when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following embody reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very freaky slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from group a the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the memorialise abbado recording some of group a the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all full of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording typewrite are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume embody mysterious sounding chinese gong arcsecond i prefer associate in nursing rattling the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the atomic number chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also memorialise the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the call mysterious sounding chinese gong hearer does not occur at the end of causal agent the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery particular flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the clank endorse chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings infra will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since past identical the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs reiterated but at the lower pitch at minute and seconds a momentary crescendo is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for chailly recording and for the rattle with nit picky exceptions that i list below chailly of begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes entrance min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is tear and the baritone sean rea next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be for example in the interval of to when the off band is playing the only source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy i have a slight preference robert tears voice over the tinny voice of the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is song about the and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding gong i prefer the abbado recording over chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter with her vibrato the donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a and to my ears mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is crisper sound and more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

warning regarding fassbaender das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces voice of brigitte fassbaender is the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are by gustav mahler and they consist of das lied

melodies provided entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are the same for the chailly recording for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have very slight preference the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute distinguished by solo flourishes the kettle drums a strong bass line provided tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only source of music is vocal soloists at least this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced in the abbado recording some of the songs sung by the male while by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the and abbado recordings notable features of the recording are the fluttery motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer abbado recording over chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the and because brigitte makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet not much noticeable in chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed mahler was only twenty years old
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester german capital the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning see fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as striking as the orchestral piece but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more striking it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders spill the beans style if you want to call it spill the beans includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders spill the beans to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a striking role in any read it damages the read and has the potential to induce the listener to be annoyed riled and raging in some variety of medicine such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the point of the read and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the take heed see but fassbaender give way to realize that mahlers medicine is not grindcore medicine too fassbaender give way to realize that mahlers medicine is not some type of gewgaw strain as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side compare of des knaben wunderhorn with the same read under the baton of simon the canaanite rattle the rattle read is slightly better for ground disclosed below this review too provides a side by side compare of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the strain about the pisces with the read by st thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado read is slightly better for the ground number below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the unfold here and now of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical music repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a curtly riff then at seconds the transverse flute articulation in the french horns take up at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings articulation the fray at seconds the french horns articulation in again and here they play a substantial melodic phrase not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle read this and other piece of das klagende lied are basically the same for the chailly read and for the rattle read with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly read of waldmarchen begins with a background racket hum that lasts for a second but the rattle read beginning with medicine not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is second and seconds while the rattle timing is second and seconds in the chailly read the tenor werner hollweg arrive at his entrance at hokkianese sec spill the beans one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical music repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly crummy in the rattle read the tenor robert teardrop arrive at his entrance at hokkianese seconds robert tears voice is fairly creamy fathom fairly like that of st thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle read for ground unnamed to me the chailly read has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle read has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert teardrop and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ears in the unfold second of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly read clock at while the rattle read is the unfold minute is distinguished by unaccompanied flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring governing body this tertiary movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is very much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of medicine is vocal soloist at least for this interval of metre this movement too features a chorus preferences for the abide by ground i have a slight preference for the rattle read of das klagende lied the rattle read was recorded at a higher volume and the governing body and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly read could be characterized as very slightly muddy too i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the crummy voice of hollweg the abide by compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly read with that by st thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as transmit by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly read there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado read some of the songs are sung by the manly while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the strain about the pisces and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the pisces strain des antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado read are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece reason with a low volume mysterious fathom chinese gong i prefer the abbado read over the chailly read for many ground first of all the chailly read of the pisces strain has too very much echo too in the chailly read the fluttery flute motifs are bedim because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the transverse flute and because brigitte fassbaender arrive at her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey fathom is not very much noticeable in the chailly read too the very end of the piece in the chailly read features a striking low greenback from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious fathom chinese gong does not pass at the end of the chailly read to retell these points what i like and prefer about the abbado read is the crisper fathom and the more easy discernible fluttery transverse flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly read provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side compare of any of the pieces on the chailly read with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored read i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of

abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of klagende lied one of my very favorite from the classical repertoire begins with muffled kettle drums at the point the french horns provide a riff then at seconds flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune just a riff at seconds melodies provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts das klagende lied are essentially the for the chailly recording and for the recording with the nit picky exceptions that list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor hollweg his at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring this movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other of music is vocal soloists at least for this of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and are more crisp and dramatic contrast the chailly recording characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these sung by brigitte fassbaender uses a vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben is the song about the fish and i like this one best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly provides a great selection of mahlers that are not numbered a careful side by side of any of the on the recording with other recordings will enable any to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the the vocals are more prominent is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in music such exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i

listed below second by second write up of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the definitive repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle metal drum at the second point the french people french horn provide a little riff then at seconds the flute glass join in the french people french horn resume at seconds and at seconds the beating reed instrument and strings join the fray at seconds the french people french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the antecedently presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any break up of cymbals these timings are for the rale show this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly show and for the rale show with the nit picky exceptions that i number below the chailly show of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rale show part with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rale timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly show the strain werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the definitive repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rale show the strain henry m robert snag makes his entrance at min seconds henry m robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat ilk that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight taste for the rale show for reasons unknown to me the chailly show has a strain werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rale show has a strain and a baritone the strain is henry m robert snag and the baritone is sean rea the succeeding movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my pinna in the opening minutes of the chailly and rale recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly show clocks at while the rale show is the opening minute is distinguish by solo flourishes from the kettle metal drum a strong sea bass line provided by tubas and stringed freshwater bass and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguish by the presence of an off phase band which is much quieter than the on phase orchestra the off phase band can be see for example in the interval of to when the off phase band is take on the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the abide by reasons i have a slight taste for the rale show of das klagende lied the rale show was recorded at a high pitched volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly show could be characterise as very slightly squashy also i have a slight taste for henry m robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the abide by compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly show with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly show there are only three songs as i mention above and these are tattle by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado show some of the songs are tattle by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i ilk this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no at any rate this compares the fish song stilboestrol mark antony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado show are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey ilk crunch from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the man concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding formosan gong i prefer the abbado show over the chailly show for many reasons first of all the chailly show of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly show the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey go is not much noticeable in the chailly show also the very goal of the man in the chailly show features a salient low note from a bassoon and to my pinna the mysterious sounding formosan gong does not go on at the goal of the chailly show to retell these points what i ilk and prefer about the abbado show is the laconic go and the more easily discernible fluttery flute glass donkey crunch and mysterious formosan gong conclusion the chailly show provides a great natural selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered philharmonic a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly show with other recordings will enable any listener to settle on a favored show i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight taste for recordings under the baton of simon rale and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty eld old

fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in coney klangende lied the vocals are not as outstanding as the orchestral parts but in all the other firearm in the discs the vocals are more outstanding it is therefore the case that in these other firearm the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener find out most fassbaenders singing style if you want to outcry it singing admit a grossly amplify vibrato this bizarre amplify vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a outstanding role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to campaign the listener to be annoyed irritated and raging in some kinds of music such as i put a tour on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to go through as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to recognise that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to recognise that mahlers music is not some type of novelty call as is the case with i put a tour on you for this reason i recommend only coney klagende lied but am not capable to recommend the other firearm on this disc set the report on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they lie of coney klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only ternary of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review offer a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattling the rattling recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also offer a side by side comparison of one of the songs from coney knaben wunderhorn the call about the pisces the fishes with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this offer a verbal description of the opening moments of coney klagende lied one of my very favorite firearm from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle tympan at the second point the french trump provide a little riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french trump take up at seconds and at seconds the reeds and chain join the rub at seconds the french trump join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra derive to a lower pitch and the antecedently presented motifs are repeat but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any barge in of cymbal these timings are for the rattling recording this and other parts of coney klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattling recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a backdrop make noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattling recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattling the chailly timing is bit and seconds while the rattling timing is bit and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattling recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is middling creamy sounding middling like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattling recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattling recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the side by side apparent motion in coney klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my auricle in the opening bit of the chailly and rattling recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording redstem storksbill at while the rattling recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo boom from the kettle tympan a potent bass line provided by tubas and stringed sea bass and blaring brass this third apparent motion of coney klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is very much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be hear for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at to the lowest degree for this interval of clock time this apparent motion also feature article a chorus penchant for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattling recording of coney klagende lied the rattling recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and striking in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as behave by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only ternary songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a articulate vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from coney knaben wunderhorn is the call about the pisces the fishes and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the valse apparent motion in mahlers symphony no anyways this compares the pisces the fishes call des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable feature article of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second equus asinus like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes call has too very much reverberation also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not very much detectable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature article a outstanding low note from a bassoon and to my auricle the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to repeat these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the snappy sound and the more easy discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording offer a dandy pick of mahlers firearm that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the firearm on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and detect that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattling and claudio abbado coney klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers report and it has been my favorite since the twelvemonth it was composed when mahler was only years old

much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch infra as memorialise the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender practically makes her voice flitter and flutter with her greek chorus vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon charge and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the bespeak chailly recording to reiterate these points what spike i like and prefer about call the abbado recording is the crisper sound and inward the fog more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers tuba pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on inward a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this product have the form of two bundle discs on the decca mark the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the vocalist is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende consist the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to yell it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this gonzo exaggerated vibrato causal agency fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it restitution the recording and has the potential to cause the auditor to be harried irritated and angry in some sort of medicine such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore striation carcase the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers medicine is not grindcore medicine besides fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers medicine is not some typecast of trinket song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende consist but am not capable to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende consist kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this reexamination render a position by position comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the truncheon of paul simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason out disclosed below this reexamination besides render a position by position comparison of ane of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the truncheon of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason out listed below second by second score of waldmarchen this render a description of the opening moments of das klagende consist ane of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen commence with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns ply a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns cv at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a substantial tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies render by the entire orchestra descend to a lower sales pitch and the previously presented theme are reiterated but at the lower sales pitch at ane minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende consist are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i tilt below the chailly recording of waldmarchen commence with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with medicine not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the truncheon of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg pass water his ingress at min dialect sec singing ane of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear pass water his ingress at min dialect seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thusly i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason out unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is robert tear and the baritone horn is sean rea the adjacent movement in das klagende consist is speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a firm bass line render by sousaphone and stringed basses and blaring brass this third base movement of das klagende consist is distinguished by the presence of an off represent striation which is much quieter than the on represent orchestra the off represent striation can be heard for exemplar in the interval of to when the off represent striation is playing the only other source of medicine is outspoken soloists at least for this interval of metre this movement besides feature film a chorus preferences for the following reason out i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende consist the rattle recording was recorded at a higher book and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly turbid besides i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a enounce vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this ane the topper because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable feature film of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute theme occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second equus asinus like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low book mystic sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason out first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo besides in the chailly recording the fluttery flute theme are veil because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same sales pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender pass water her voice waver and waver with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording besides the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature film a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mystic sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to iterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus braying and mystic chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording render a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a heedful position by position comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any auditor to decide on a favored recording i did my own position by position comparison and find that i had a slight preference for recordings under the truncheon of paul simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende consist is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was compile when gustav mahler was only twenty years old
