0	after hearing a few of liberas choral works on my internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and this cd the boys have beautiful voices can not be doubted what i didnt like after a few listenings to the entire cd was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing groove and rarely deviates i also found the lyrics sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey a thiny but oh so deep christian overtones some of them were laughable as if written by a highschool freshman trying out first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the words because they much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and finally when reading the liner notes it says that that producer choral master dubbed in voices from older boys to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lads the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angels are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only do as background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choirs recordings that dont sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter silly lyrics and being over dubbed to make sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choirs is they dont have the trained voices professionals and dont sound perfect try the many recordings of the vienna boys choir if you want to listen to good childrens choir album if you love good choral music as i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i you will be sorry a few songs are ok to to but an entire album of the same is grating to the least
