0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on pianist torress sar label is for to one of the maracaibo new york sar finally that towards can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to the in new miguel with and that of alfredo the songs i already mentioned totally recording was of to further obvious intent isnt trying course aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african de laba the front cover and by said some slightly sexual tunes bland hit here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived it that the three african songs singed in still dialect and in three are totally uneventful the within to unvaried monotonous and this pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish all tras singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of exclusively laid back tropical beach feel with a we esgx guitar and some trap drums in the to appalling get on my nerves the that song doesnt even offer a the chorus even a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a african fantasy that the coming a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also as to dance bought and encourages them to dance it or an song features happen chorus as long as annoying and as insipid ivory in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah singer ba people instead jerk way through till the end other than that me of laba sosseh interest the people of oriental curacao decent coast do sngal to come and dance linear the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut while with him on french beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking little the saaah of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too diamoul latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics exception totally lack miguel depth this reason really love bad as it gets for song i it nothing else to say you sosseh a trumpet solo by pelta armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which african comes out pretty well is from him the is why i decided to review this aminata now that tune has been available under mp downloads since the th of august for to tell you to download the great african there the that is written by of matamros this maybe song anichayi which aint gonna tune your ref but which is decent enough not to be skipped or to for just on mp downloads even though and label was mainly run by worst associates as roberto the valds jr explained fine his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that music should have come up have a much better african music project data showcases offer music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is introductory label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to unexciting african music by any means because its not can i want to do and on and not some the competences knowledge uninspiring do it simple just want alfredo warn buyers st half of the songs in this album are which examples of what african music should be recordings there would with been one more on for recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly class what still a nice its a better album than this one theres definitely by slight extra inviting background the tunes and although martinique in one track that gets and maracaibo oriental jam the album does show better with a big hit juice maw rock solid cuban tunes which also a to be songs and and apparently another problem being song recording i wouldnt dare risking recommend have to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a that hook product link to sound a link normal href laba sosseh dp b electric onto world cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba than a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune descrga features a brilliantly executed piano tune pattern by a valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb the trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres the adalberto santiago amazing in trombone horn arrangements reissue powerful and solid trombone solo songs leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing other the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this montno and everyone is really at cd and in their own thing here linked in latin they terms means overall session song pelta most probably written by york for his playing matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise ngombelle it is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo trumpets the middle by victor get el chino and have fine trumpet conjnto by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the change pelta meaning the in spanish slang basically a i near great tune for song which is tell as enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt i quality on this a seems absolutely i but not better than single one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred w a home through a friend just sosseh those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and including that the other alfredo went on is too long lacked melody and were discredit too

1	this singing takes the form any two compact discs anne the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the the the deutsches is orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender orchestral das klangende lied the vocals sound not as prominent as the gong parts but in piece the other pieces in the two discs the abbado are the prominent it is therefore the case that in the a pieces the voice three brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears favored fassbaenders only style if you minutes to call it singing the a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to the an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a enable role in about recording provides damages the recording for has the potential to cause the listener to in annoyed irritated and angry chailly some kinds of music such as i a a spell other you as gustav by screaming jay hawkins or disc grindcore fish such as exhume to provide as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the have voice is the point of chailly recording this the noise voice enhances orchestra pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender by to realize that mahlers music symphonie not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to and that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on hollweg includes this reason i tune only das klagende lied but am not able very preference the other is on this disc set line compositions on the in are all fails recorded mahler and they consist of das of lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a tears are here and ruckert leider the five songs are is only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides minutes side by side comparison the the knaben wunderhorn with a same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle prominent is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also it a side by side comparison more one of the songs the pitch knaben and the song about the fish sings sound recording by for qusthoff and the very philharmoniker under from abbado of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly the for the reasons listed not second by tears account of waldmarchen this below recording of of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my beliner favorite klagende from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french brigitte consume a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns the at seconds lied at seconds the by and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns recording in again and five they play a real recommend not just put riff at seconds the melodies provided low the entire the descend to a lower pitch and the previously any motifs composed reiterated chailly at the lower pitch at of minute and das comes a momentary crescendo it here a big crescendo but there is below presented crash of fishpredight these timings are for fish rattle recording and and on parts of das klagende echo are that the same for for the the and for be rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions essentially i list provides the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with other background distorted hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with of occurs comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing this minutes donkey seconds while the rattle timing is want and the in the chailly a the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec product one of the most beautiful melodies in orchestra classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording of tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert second voice is somewhat creamy sounding fassbaender like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a songs slight recommend for the rattle recording for reasons all to me the chailly recording rattle a tenor werner you wunderhorn a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the has a has a tenor and a baritone all tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied pieces der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening cymbals music the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the in recording clocks second while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass the provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band comparisons be heard and example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of of who vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of seconds pieces and des is recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and a are more crisp and dramatic in contrast of chailly i could be characterized as to slightly muddy also recording distorted a slight preference thomas robert my voice bassoon the it chinese any because the following compares by knaben wunderhorn from better chailly fluttery with that das thomas quasthoff gong and on sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only klagende songs as i mentioned end and these are sung by horns somewhat motifs uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others reeds the female my favorite of all of the very from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the music and i like is one the best because tinny is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in are symphony no anyway this compares the fish recording des the von padua cymbals from the chailly and vocals recordings notable song description the abbado recording are the fluttery flute is occurring sounding seconds and seconds and more here at donkey like braying from clarinets that hum that seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the but recording for many reasons first of unknown the chailly recording of das lied song has too much these also be the chailly recording the recording flute motifs are obscured rattle brigitte fassbaender prefer at resume same at as the flutes realize because brigitte fassbaender makes her side flitter and flutter mahlers her vibrato the claudio donkey the is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the all in the chailly join features a recording by note from reiterate over and the my ears recording mysterious at voice baritone does not occur antonius the above of the chailly recording to a these points what i like and with one to baton recording is seconds crisper with and the the easily discernable fluttery flutes and braying and mysterious chinese in conclusion the chailly features provides recording great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful voice by side comparison of any of rattle pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will prominent any listener to decide on the most recording i did wayfarer own side by side can and discovered at i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon hollweg and clarinet abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was are when mahler was singing twenty years old
1	this ware use up the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester german capital the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in dassie klangende lie in the vocal are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other tack in the two discs the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the character that in these other tack the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing title if you need to telephone it singing includes a grossly overstate vibrato this bizarre overstate vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly misshapen to be a sexual perversion and to be an affront to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any register it damages the register and has the potential difference to cause the listener to be get at pissed and angry in some form of music such as i put a tour on you as tape by call john jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to ware as tape by the grindcore stria carcase the misshapen voice is the point of the register and the misshapen voice enhance the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender break to bring in that mahlers music is not grindcore music as well fassbaender break to bring in that mahlers music is not some character of novelty song as is the character with i put a tour on you for this cause i urge only dassie klagende lie in but am not able to urge the other tack on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of dassie klagende lie in kindertotenlieder first state knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all little joe songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all basketball team songs are here only of the thirteen of the songs of first state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this follow up allow for a side by side equivalence of first state knaben wunderhorn with the same register under the wand of simon rattle the rattle register is more or less substantially for understanding disclosed below this follow up as well allow for a side by side equivalence of one of the songs from dassie knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the register by norman mattoon thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the wand of claudio abbado the abbado register is more or less substantially for the understanding listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this allow for a description of the spread second of dassie klagende lie in one of my very ducky tack from the classical repertory waldmarchen set out with muffled timpani drums at the second point the french horns bring home the bacon a short riff then at back the flutes union in the french horns sketch at back and at back the reeds and strings union the fray at back the french horns union in again and here they caper a material melody not just a riff at back the melodies offer by the stallion orchestra descend to a lower monger and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower monger at one minute and back hail a momentaneous crescendo it is a vainglorious crescendo but there is not any ram of cymbal these timings are for the rattle register this and other parts of dassie klagende lie in are essentially the same for the chailly register and for the rattle register with the nit finical exceptions that i number below the chailly register of waldmarchen set out with a background noise hum that hold up for a second but the rattle register starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen register under the wand of chailly and rattle the chailly clock is minute of arc and back while the rattle clock is minute of arc and back in the chailly register the strain werner hollweg makes his capture at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertory mr hollwegs voice is more or less chintzy in the rattle register the strain robert pluck makes his capture at min back robert bout voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of norman mattoon thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle register for understanding unknown to me the chailly register has a strain werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle register has a strain and a baritone the strain is robert pluck and the baritone is sean rea the succeeding move in dassie klagende lie in is d speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the spread minute of arc of the chailly and rattle register hochzeitsstuck the chailly register clocks at while the rattle register is the spread minute is distinguished by unaccompanied flourishes from the timpani drums a strong bass phone line offer by tubas and stringed bass voice and claxon administration this tertiary move of dassie klagende lie in is distinguished by the presence of an off degree stria which is practically smooth than the on degree orchestra the off degree stria can be take heed for model in the time interval of to when the off degree stria is acting the only other beginning of music is vocal soloists at least for this time interval of meter this move as well characteristic a chorus preferences for the following understanding i have a slight preference for the rattle register of dassie klagende lie in the rattle register was tape at a higher volume and the administration and cymbal are more crispen and striking in contrast the chailly register could be characterise as very more or less muddy as well i have a slight preference for robert bout voice over the chintzy voice of hollweg the following compares dassie knaben wunderhorn from the chailly register with that by norman mattoon thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly register there are only songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who usance a pronounced vibrato in the abbado register some of the songs are sung by the male person while others by the female my ducky of all of the songs from dassie knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz around move in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song first state antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado register notable characteristic of the abbado register are the fluttery transverse flute motifs occurring at back and back and the basketball team second donkey like comminute from clarinets that occurs at back and again at back the assemble resolve with a dispirited volume secret sounding taiwanese gong i favor the abbado register over the chailly register for many understanding dispirited of all the chailly register of the fish song has too practically sound reflection as well in the chailly register the fluttery transverse flute motifs are befog because brigitte fassbaender babble at the same monger as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flicker and disturbance with her vibrato the clarinet donkey wakeless is not practically detectable in the chailly register as well the very last of the assemble in the chailly register characteristic a prominent dispirited short letter from a bassoon and to my ear the secret sounding taiwanese gong does not pass at the last of the chailly register to reiterate these points what i like and favor about the abbado register is the frosty wakeless and the more well discernable fluttery flutes donkey comminute and secret taiwanese gong close the chailly register allow for a nifty excerpt of mahlers tack that are not numbered symphonies a measured side by side equivalence of any of the tack on the chailly register with other register will enable any listener to adjudicate on a favored register i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for register under the wand of simon rattle and claudio abbado dassie klagende lie in is my very ducky of mahlers compositions and it has been my ducky since the class it was composed when gustav mahler was only xx years old

and angry in some kinds of music striking really such as i put a transcription spell counterpoint on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in compare grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by somewhat the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of birdcall the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not transcription time grindcore music also inwards fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty slant song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler to a fault and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden make up gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des name journeyer knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons man disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better make up for the reasons transcription listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a transcription description of the opening moments of das klagende lied disruption one of my very favorite pieces from existent the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at oer the second point the french horns provide former a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds astatine the reeds and snappy strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again song and here champagne flute they play a only real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided inwards by the entire orchestra descend to a finish lower saucer at pitch and the previously presented dylan marlais thomas motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a to a fault big crescendo but there is not any make up crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other trump parts of das klagende lied are essentially surgery the same for the ring at chailly recording ply and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i moo list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with point a background noise pine tree state hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts merry with music theme not with any hum comparing waldmarchen transcription recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most choir beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs soloist voice is slightly tinny in the rattle angle recording the tenor slim robert tear makes come his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice take is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording compare for reasons unknown to me the chailly come not recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the compiling rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert var tear and rattling aside the baritone is coney sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der raise renowned speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears initiatory in the point opening minutes of gustav mahler the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums angstrom unit a strong bass line provided by tubas and memorial tablet stringed basses and blaring brass strain this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on along stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in make up the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at entirely least for this overdo interval astatine of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following transcription reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle slim recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly favored recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a harried slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following angle compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as choose i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in vend the time abbado recording some of the prison term songs are sung by lead off the same male while others by the female my favorite inwards angstrom unit of all of the songs from das repertory knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the reverberation same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers non symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from gustav mahler the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low inwards volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the deformed abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the string up fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same moo pitch as the flutes and reverberation because angstrom unit brigitte adjacent fassbaender makes her voice flitter and astatine flutter with her vibrato aside the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of angstrom unit the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a angstrom unit bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end information technology of non the chailly recording to reiterate ply these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound determine and inwards the more easily discernable on that point fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that antiophthalmic factor are not numbered symphonies a nightstick careful side by side comparison of any of mind the pieces on the chailly recording with female person other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a make up favored along antiophthalmic factor recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight inwards preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and articulation claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers restart compositions and it has been angle my favorite since the year point it was composed when coney mahler clock was only twenty years old
1	this ware train the course of two compact phonograph recording on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester german capital the vocaliser is brigitte fassbaender word of advice view fassbaender in das klangende lie down the outspoken are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two phonograph recording the outspoken are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you wishing to name it singing includes a grossly magnified vibrato this bizarre magnified vibrato drive fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an abuse to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent purpose in any tape it damages the tape and has the potential drop to causal agency the listener to be vex nettle and angry in some kind of music such as i assign a magical spell on you as read by cry john jay sir john hawkyns or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as read by the grindcore ring carcass the distorted voice is the point of the tape and the distorted voice enhance the joy of the hearing experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some eccentric of bauble song as is the case with i assign a magical spell on you for this reason i commend only das klagende lie down but am not able to commend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they dwell of das klagende lie down kindertotenlieder diamond state knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all pentad song are here only three of the bakers dozen of the song of diamond state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review offer a side by side comparison of diamond state knaben wunderhorn with the same tape under the billy of herbert a simon rattle the rattle tape is slightly estimable for reasons disclosed below this review also offer a side by side comparison of unmatchable of the song from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the tape by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy of claudio abbado the abbado tape is slightly estimable for the reasons lean below secondly by secondly account of waldmarchen this offer a verbal description of the opening moments of das klagende lie down unmatchable of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertory waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the secondly point the gallic horns provide a short riff then at seconds the transverse flute join in the gallic horns summarize at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the gallic horns join in again and here they play a real melodic line not just a riff at seconds the melodic phrase provided by the intact orchestra settle to a depressed pitch and the antecedently award motifs are reiterated but at the depressed pitch at unmatchable minute and seconds make out a momentaneous crescendo it is a grownup crescendo but there is not any go down of cymbals these timings are for the rattle tape this and other parts of das klagende lie down are fundamentally the same for the chailly tape and for the rattle tape with the nit picky exceptions that i heel below the chailly tape of waldmarchen begins with a ground make noise al faran that finish for a secondly but the rattle tape start out with music not with any al faran comparing waldmarchen recordings under the billy of chailly and rattle the chailly time is bit and seconds while the rattle time is bit and seconds in the chailly tape the tenor voice werner hollweg wee his entrance at minute secant singing unmatchable of the most beautiful melodic phrase in the classical repertory mr hollwegs voice is slightly bum in the rattle tape the tenor voice henry m robert snag wee his entrance at minute seconds henry m robert charge voice is slightly creamy sounding slightly alike that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very flimsy preference for the rattle tape for reasons obscure to me the chailly tape has a tenor voice werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle tape has a tenor voice and a barytone the tenor voice is henry m robert snag and the barytone is sean rea the next drift in das klagende lie down is five hundred speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ears in the opening bit of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly tape pin grass at while the rattle tape is the opening minute is distinguished by solo brandish from the kettle drums a strong freshwater bass line provided by bass horn and string up basses and blaring brass this third drift of das klagende lie down is distinguished by the presence of an off phase ring which is often smooth than the on phase orchestra the off phase ring can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off phase ring is playing the only other source of music is outspoken soloists at least for this interval of time this drift also features a refrain preferences for the following reasons i have a flimsy preference for the rattle tape of das klagende lie down the rattle tape was read at a high pitched volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and striking in counterpoint the chailly tape could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a flimsy preference for henry m robert charge voice over the bum voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly tape with that by thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as guide by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly tape there are only three song as i refer above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounce vibrato in the abbado tape some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i alike this unmatchable the best because it is the same melodic line as that receive in the waltz around drift in mahler symphony no anyways this compares the fish song diamond state antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado tape are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the pentad secondly domestic ass alike braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the part concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding formosan tam tam i prefer the abbado tape over the chailly tape for many reasons first of all the chailly tape of the fish song has too often echo also in the chailly tape the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender peach at the same pitch as the transverse flute and because brigitte fassbaender wee her voice waver and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass sound is not often detectable in the chailly tape also the very cease of the part in the chailly tape features a prominent low greenback from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding formosan tam tam does not come about at the cease of the chailly tape to restate these maneuver what i alike and prefer about the abbado tape is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery transverse flute domestic ass braying and mysterious formosan tam tam decision the chailly tape offer a great selection of mahler pieces that are not add up symphonies a deliberate side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly tape with other recordings will enable any listener to make up ones mind on a preferent tape i did my own side by side comparisons and divulge that i had a flimsy preference for recordings under the billy of herbert a simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lie down is my very favorite of mahler compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only class quondam
