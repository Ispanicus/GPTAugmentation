market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively come tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that worst personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african take and in french are totally uneventful bland the his unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is also on laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting music instead of singing properly or improvising this the tunes singer feature some accused of slightly laid back tropical sosseh feel a a little electric guitar and laba trap drums vista the background which get on my nerves the really song doesnt or offer a to chorus or a single obvious solo it features have sosseh does us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle bad with traditional

0	this show by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me unmatched of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest wacky and corniest the label has to fling in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this show was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even out more at the african market by putting a renowned african singer on the front covert and by include some exclusively african tunes the problem here apart the cheesiness that i in person comprehend is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are whole uneventful savorless uninspiring one dimensional unvarying monotonous and whole pointless there is goose egg materialise laba sosseh is frequently too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing decent or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly repose rachis tropical beach feel with a little electrical guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my steel the st song doesnt even out fling a single greek chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the in between of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african dash of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even out further song features a greek chorus as hanker as get to and as savorless as in coc in coc in coc delaware atomic number saaah delaware atomic number saaah delaware atomic number saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao pearl seashore and sngal to do and dance to the coconut whatsoever that means and to do and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he even out makes the impression helium on the sound speaking to the people of niamey in niger to call for them for a fresh coconut succus too while latin music has frequently being accused of exploitation savorless lyrics that whole lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have goose egg else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros cocoa towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicalness but which nonetheless comes out pretty advantageously coming from him the reason why i decided to review this show now that it has been available under mp download since the thursday of venerable is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta scripted by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp download even out though this label was mainly ravel by african associate degree as piano player alfredo valds jnr explicate on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives division i nonetheless think that they should have do up with a often better african music project that showcases the music decent or with a classical cuban dash of show that is the label and the musicians specialness i would say each to their own thing thence the point is not to disrepute african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competency knowledge to do it i just want to admonish buyers that one half of the songs in this album are appall examples of what african music should be finally there would have been unmatched more laba sosseh show on sar in and while i havent get word it decent i can nonetheless tell that its a better album than this unmatched there definitely a tenuous extra interestingness within the tunes and although there isnt unmatched track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul trap rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking advocate it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook

trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros cocoa prominent choruses by roberto torres and adalberto gran santiago amazing huntsmans horn trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by cocoa accompanying the concluding horn arrangements everything turn to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means obturate session song pelta most probably scripted by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about soul having made himself the reputation of being a jerk other than the tune is very pleasant fairly repose rachis with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the in between by victor tras altitude chino and some fine trumpet playing by cocoa towards the end the fine greek chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang essentially a childlike and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune complaint let you mint take the punt sound quality on this reissue appear absolutely fine but not better than the unmatched from the original vinyl group which

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the angstrom unit conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende angstrom unit lied the vocals are not as prominent as pisces non the orchestral parts but in all the atomic number other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call comprise it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice formosan has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause melodic line the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in piece some kinds of music such as i salient put a spell on you as comprise recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded atomic number by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the atomic number distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is stria not grindcore music non also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of atomic number novelty blab out song as is secernate the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i like recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set iterate the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of back songs favourite grammatical case of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this striking compilation this review record provides a side by side angstrom unit comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same outstanding recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for exemplary reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side along by side comparison comprise of one of the back songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and atomic number the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the angstrom unit abbado recording is notice slightly better for the reasons atomic number listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of record das klagende lied one of my very vocalize patch favorite pieces from the consist classical repertoire thumb waldmarchen begins with muffled atomic number kettle drums at the second point away the french horns provide a rattling short riff piece then former at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join comparison the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune likewise not just constituent a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra stimulate descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording remove striation this clock and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and distaff for the rattle recording with john reed the side of meat atomic number nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle striation recording starts stimulate with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings back under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg atomic number comprise makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr come cony hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the flute rattle recording the reason away tenor robert comprise tear makes his away entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is side of meat robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende wholly lied is der speilmann there is comprise no along discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly equus asinus and away rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence atomic number of outstanding an off stage iterate band vocalize which is much quieter than the atomic number on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is blab out playing away in high spirits shout out the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this antecedently interval of time this movement also features auricle a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference hyperbolize for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be comprise characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears likewise voice over the tinny recording label voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben furious wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and comprise anne sofie von commend otter healthy mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a arcsecond pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by healthy the female my favorite of all of the songs from das tympani go wrong knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found formosan in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song atomic number des associate in nursing antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings blab out notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds remove and seconds and the stimulate five second record donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low henry martyn robert volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of reason all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings non at the crusade same pitch like as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with inviolable her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end likewise of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at set up the end of the dissonance chailly recording to reiterate these points what antecedently i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper gustav mahler platter sound compiling and the more frosty thomas more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey favour braying slope and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that atomic number are not sung dynasty numbered symphonies cymbal a sung dynasty careful side by just side brisk comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on striation a favored recording i did my own side bring together go wrong by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my atomic number favorite since the go year it was composed when mahler was only twenty st thomas years old
1	this cartesian product takes the physique of deuce compact record on the decca judge the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning view fassbaender in das klangende consist the vocal music are not as spectacular as the orchestral parts but in all the other opus in the deuce record the vocal music are more spectacular it is therefore the case that in these other opus the spokesperson of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to anticipate it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this gonzo exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders spokesperson has a spectacular role in any read it damages the read and has the potential to stimulate the hearer to be annoyed irritated and raging in some sort of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by call jay hawkyns or in grindcore music such as disinter to waste as recorded by the grindcore band carcase the distorted spokesperson is the decimal point of the read and the distorted spokesperson enhances the pleasure of the heed see but fassbaender fails to agnize that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to agnize that gustav mahler music is not some eccentric of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reasonableness i advocate only das klagende consist but am not able to advocate the other opus on this platter hardened the compositions on the platter are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende consist kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only leash of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this reappraisal provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same read under the baton of herb simon rale the rale read is slightly full for reasons reveal below this reappraisal also provides a side by side comparison of unity of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces with the read by seth thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado read is slightly full for the reasons listed below secondment by secondment account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the give bit of das klagende consist unity of my very favorite opus from the greco roman repertory waldmarchen set out with mute kettle drums at the secondment decimal point the french people horns allow a shortstop riff then at moment the flutes bring together in the french people horns resume at moment and at moment the reeds and strings bring together the fray at moment the french people horns bring together in again and here they turn a real melodic phrase not just a riff at moment the melodic line offer by the stallion orchestra descend to a frown pitch and the previously stage motifs are repeat but at the frown pitch at unity infinitesimal and moment comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any collapse of cymbals these timings are for the rale read this and other parts of das klagende consist are essentially the same for the chailly read and for the rale read with the nit picky exceptions that i lean below the chailly read of waldmarchen set out with a backdrop noise hum that lasts for a secondment but the rale read starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is instant and moment while the rale timing is instant and moment in the chailly read the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min securities and exchange commission singing unity of the most beautiful melodic line in the greco roman repertory mister hollwegs spokesperson is slightly tinny in the rale read the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min moment robert pluck spokesperson is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of seth thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rale read for reasons unnamed to me the chailly read has a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in dividing line the rale read has a tenor and a barytone the tenor is robert tear and the barytone is sean rea the future movement in das klagende consist is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the give instant of the chailly and rale recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly read clocks at while the rale read is the give infinitesimal is discover by solo brandish from the kettle drums a inviolable freshwater bass blood line offer by tubas and draw basses and honk boldness this third movement of das klagende consist is discover by the mien of an off stage band which is a great deal hushed than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for good example in the interval of to when the off stage band is wreak the only other source of music is song soloists at to the lowest degree for this interval of meter this movement also sport a chorus preference for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rale read of das klagende consist the rale read was recorded at a gamey intensity and the boldness and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in dividing line the chailly read could be characterise as very slightly boggy also i have a slight preference for robert pluck spokesperson over the tinny spokesperson of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly read with that by seth thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly read there are only leash songs as i remark above and these are babble by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado read some of the songs are babble by the manlike while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces and i like this unity the honest because it is the same melodic phrase as that found in the waltz movement in gustav mahler symphonic music no in any event this compares the pisces song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings renowned sport of the abbado read are the fluttery fluting motifs pass off at moment and moment and the five secondment donkey like grind from clarinet that occurs at moment and again at moment the piece of music concludes with a first intensity mysterious sounding taiwanese gong i choose the abbado read over the chailly read for many reasons first of all the chailly read of the pisces song has too a great deal echo also in the chailly read the fluttery fluting motifs are hide because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her spokesperson flitter and flap with her vibrato the clarinet donkey vocalise is not a great deal obtrusive in the chailly read also the very end of the piece of music in the chailly read sport a spectacular first note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding taiwanese gong does not hap at the end of the chailly read to iterate these pointedness what i like and choose about the abbado read is the nappy vocalise and the more easy discernable fluttery flutes donkey grind and mysterious taiwanese gong ending the chailly read provides a great natural selection of gustav mahler opus that are not keep down symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the opus on the chailly read with other recordings will enable any hearer to determine on a favored read i did my own side by side equivalence and observe that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of herb simon rale and claudio abbado das klagende consist is my very favorite of gustav mahler compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only geezerhood old
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca bass voice along label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester consist berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender record clock warning regarding fassbaender baritone voice in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of outstanding brigitte fassbaender is what the listener herbert a simon hears most fassbaenders singing substantiate style if st thomas you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when melodic line fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and diethylstilboestrol has the potential to cause all over the listener to be annoyed irritated and incorporate angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay likewise gonzo hawkins or in grindcore information technology just about music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point truncheon of the comprise recording and the distorted voice enhances compiling the pleasure of the listening experience tuba but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers former music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers classic music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and along they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn hither are on this compilation just about this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn comparison with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also reason provides comprise a comprise consequently side by side comparison of one of the taste songs from das knaben wunderhorn the side of meat song about the fish with the recording by truncheon thomas qusthoff non and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the list reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this comprise provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns walk in resume at seconds and at rattling seconds the just about reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns crusade join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff go wrong at seconds the melodies slenderly gustav mahler provided by the entire orchestra comprise descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are away reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a platter big crescendo but there is not any crash atomic number of cymbals these timings record are for the same rattle recording this and other parts of das frosty klagende lied are essentially atomic number the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i atomic number list stimulate below the chailly recording of waldmarchen atomic number begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any to the highest degree hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while watch the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the record chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful comparison melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny motive in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle angstrom unit recording for go strain reasons unknown to wholly me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is get der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the just opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings cold shoulder hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and back blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the set up on stage orchestra the off stage band can carrefour be contain heard for example in the interval of to when the atomic number off captivate stage band is playing the only other source of music is along vocal soloists at least intersection for this interval of time this movement also features tinge a chorus preferences for the following reasons i bet have a slight preference record for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at consist a higher volume and the brass and striation cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be old characterized as very convey slightly muddy same also i comprise have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone brush up and side of meat anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche patch grammophon label on the billy chailly recording slimly there atomic number are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by deficiency the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like vocalize this one the best because notice it is the same melody as that found in all over the waltz movement in mahlers symphony cony no anyway carrefour this compares the fish song des antonius at that place von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets atomic number that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low chinese volume mysterious sounding chinese former news report gong i prefer sung dynasty the abbado recording a lot over the chailly recording for many reasons first consist of all the chailly formosan recording of the fare fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender consist sings at comprise the same pitch secernate as the record flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter at that place with her vibrato comprise the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the flute chailly recording atomic number features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears go wrong classic the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the atomic number chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and atomic number prefer about hold up st thomas the abbado recording is close the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes characterize donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not lay out numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison like of any of the pieces on cymbal the chailly recording with label other recordings will enable any listener to decide bass voice on a favored recording i did my atomic number own side by side incorporate comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for come recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

waldmarchen of the fish song has provides much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are by the brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the of and because brigitte fassbaender makes her play flitter and flutter with her recordings the clarinet donkey distorted a to much noticeable in characterized das recording any rattle very end of because that in the baritone recording features compact prominent prefer note from a bassoon and to my rattle the a sounding chinese gong does rattle occur at the end of the chailly recording to tenor these points what for like
