0	this recording by senegalese singer released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this was of course an obvious intent in to aim more the african market by putting a famous singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped bought for on downloads even though this label was mainly run by associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own therefore the point is not to discredit music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a executed piano pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto is old tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno ill let you lot take the sound on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by ages ago which i happily transferred cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this exaggerated vibrato singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders has a prominent in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by qusthoff and the beliner under the baton claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns in again and here they play a real not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a crescendo it is a crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has tenor werner hollweg and a andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and recordings hochzeitsstuck the recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by and stringed basses blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source music is vocal soloists at least for this interval time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be as very slightly also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and sofie von otter mezzosoprano conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same as found in the movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter flutter with vibrato the clarinet sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and rattling seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the thence inch rattle recording this and other parts of das below klagende lied are essentially the same atomic number for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds in while the rattle timing is minutes allow for and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical henry m robert repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly cause tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at repertory min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat only creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i tenor voice have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has non a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt give birth while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das aside klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle typography recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende clarinet lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much equally quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only district attorney other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this billy interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass rattling and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly degree recording with that by thomas immortalize quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the unspoiled deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three sung songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female immortalize my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it incline is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds stria and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that vocal music occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also unspoilt in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs immortalize are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings personify at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much inch noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features non a prominent low note entirely from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at repertory the end of the chailly recording to reiterate deary these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying spectacular and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side minute comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a trace favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons slimly and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the experience but fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize mahlers is not some type of novelty song as is the case with put spell on you for this reason i recommend

simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
