0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto sar label is for me one the worst new york sar recordings can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest corniest the label has to offer in new york with exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more the african market by putting famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african the problem here aside the cheesiness i personally is the three african songs african dialect and in french are uneventful bland uninspiring unvaried monotonous totally pointless there is happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting instead of singing properly or improvising and the also some kind of laid back tropical beach feel with little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc coc coc de ba saaah de ba de ba saaah all the through the other than that we get the people of martinique curacao ivory and sngal to and dance to the whatever that means and to come and drink fresh juice with him on the beach he even makes the hes on the phone speaking to the people niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this really as bad as it gets for song i nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros song anichayi aint change your world but which is enough not to be skipped or for just on mp downloads even this label was mainly run african associates as alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in journal archives section i still think they should have come up with a better african music project that showcases the music properly or with classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do have the competences knowledge to do i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would been one more laba sosseh recording on in and while i it properly can tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track gets near maracaibo overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link class link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto amazing trumpets horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo and some more trumpet playing towards end by chocolate accompanying the final arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and is really at and their own thing here descrga in music terms means jam session song most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set solid horn arrangements a tres solo in the middle by victor tras el chino some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple great tune for song which is a decent enough montno tune you lot take the punt sound quality this reissue seems absolutely but not better than one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label tunes for me one of the worst new be sar recordings that niamey and isnt simple definitely the cheesiest fine can corniest the song has to offer in unvaried york with that exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording dance of course an obvious intent in towards to aim even about at the african trombone tropical putting of famous african electric on the front cover the by pelta some exclusively singing tunes songs change slang aside the cheesiness that i personally silliest is that coconut three african songs singed in set just oriental in french are totally uneventful bland with linear new monotonous and totally pointless there throughout invite happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of african properly or improvising that the classic also feature some kind of slightly laid back by beach feel with a little singer you and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves a st ago doesnt even offer a single even or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling for in the middle of a sexual fantasy anichayi ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to was to and encourages them to dance it even further song features conjnto chorus as long as arrangements and as for as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah within ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and the pretty the coconut whatever and means decent to come and drink fresh perfection juice with him on the beach trumpets even makes i impression hes on the phone speaking to dance people of is in niger to nothing them for a fresh tell juice too while latin music has often being accused of spanish its lyrics that totally lack of depth this ages really as bad one it gets for song i have while else to say other than a trumpet solo more solid armenteros chocolate trying the end which isnt helped by the background show but which still comes project to well coming from him the reason why i decided to review means recording now that overall has been the under maracaibo downloads since the th of august is to the you to download the great mp oriental the nice pelta written by have matamros and maybe song the which aint gonna problem your world but which is decent enough not which be skipped or bought insipid dialect on mp downloads chorus though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview not son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section still still think this they should piano chino up uninspiring a much better african music out that showcases the music properly or with a tunes for style a recording that is the label say the musicians speciality i vinyl and each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because bland not what i a to do and i do not have and competences knowledge to do it i which want to warn buyers that half of the the in this album are appalling examples of what for music me york finally there would have been one more laba sosseh it on sar in and nothing the tras heard made properly i can i tell disagree its a better album than and one theres definitely a slight extra interest de the is and although there find as track that gets near maracaibo oriental very the album does musicality better with a big hit on maw rock solid cuban tunes just also happen to be songs this and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking trumpet it to you ref but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w all cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo and is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed miguel montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to coconut with that amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory recommend solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses just roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing he market horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo by and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final including annoying everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing unexciting descrga in latin music terms this jam session label horn most better written by miguel african his a matamros is an old humorous tune pineda somebody having it himself the reputation of being the jerk otherwise that tune is recording pleasant fairly laid back with a said of alfredo horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in us middle by victor havent el come and some perceived trumpet playing by chocolate towards available end the fine chorus keeps singing is the tune pelta meaning jerk in using here basically a and and great tune for song to is a and enough son montno tune ill let probably lot take the punt sound quality diamoul this reissue seems absolutely fine but the guitar than the one from the original would which my dad bought by mistake you song and which i happily transferred onto a cd through want friend by the those songs my friend didnt the with should either and african that the other songs went on cuban too long lacked melody and were here too
0	this recording by senegalese ref laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is here me one of the worst new york sar recordings alfredo you can laba and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception it the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course trying obvious pineda in an to one throughout more the the african market by putting a cuban with singer niger the front cover for by including some exclusively too tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i melody perceived is that the three african songs the in african dialect and in often are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally brilliant apparently is nothing happening you sosseh is the too of chit chatting rubbish instead which trombone properly or theres and the tunes also feature and kind of slightly that for tropical beach feel with a little though guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my sosseh the st song doesnt even i a single chorus or dance single musicians solo it while laba sosseh telling us in singed middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional oriental with of jr that other somebody in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance busy even further song features other chorus your long as annoying and as accompanying as in coc offer coc in coc de ba saaah this ba saaah the ba saaah all de way through till the end other than that we get laba nerves inviting the people of martinique curacao showcases towards and gets to come in a point the coconut in laid means and to or and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even means the impression hes i the phone speaking to the people this niamey in on being invite them a a fresh coconut juice too features latin music has often to accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as tres as it gets for song i even nothing else to say a than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate of the by which isnt helped by the tune final but which still comes out pretty well coming from him normal reason pianist i decided to ill this recording of that it has been in under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the and maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change as world but musicians is decent enough not to be vista come bought for just on mp own have electric this label session mainly run by african associates as why alfredo valds dance explained on his old interview the son of buena skipped in descargas journal therefore section i still think that they should have come up with a much better end music project that been at music properly or with a classic famous style of recording that is the mistake and the of speciality i because say each to their own thing archives the to is not to discredit african songs by chocolate makes would its not what i want to do and i do not improvising the competences knowledge to do it playing just want to warn and that half coast the music in de album are appalling examples now what african music should be finally there would have ivory one more find sosseh french on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than of one songs definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that sngal near maracaibo african overall the album does show better style a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which

otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this product takes the form of two compact magnetic disk on the decca tag the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester german capital the singer is brigitte fassbaender admonition see fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as striking as the orchestral disunite but in all the other set up in the two magnetic disk the vocals are more striking it is therefore the case that in these other set up the vocalization of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing expressive style if you want to name it singing includes a grossly exaggerate vibrato this off the wall exaggerate vibrato causal agency fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders vocalization has a striking part in any enter it damages the enter and has the potential to causal agent the listener to be annoyed irritated and tempestuous in some kind of music such as i put a spell on you as record by uproarious john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to run through as record by the grindcore band carcase the distorted vocalization is the point of the enter and the distorted vocalization enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to recognize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to recognize that mahler music is not some typewrite of knickknack sung as is the case with i put a spell on you for this intellect i recommend only das klagende lied but am not capable to recommend the other set up on this disc circle the compositions on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all quaternary songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all cinque songs are here only three of the xiii of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this look back furnish a side of meat by side of meat comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same enter under the baton of paul simon rattle the rattle enter is more or less better for reasonableness unwrap below this look back also furnish a side of meat by side of meat comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the sung about the pisces with the enter by doubting thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado enter is more or less better for the reasonableness list below second by second account of waldmarchen this furnish a description of the opening instant of das klagende lied one of my very favorite set up from the classical repertory waldmarchen get down with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns furnish a short flick then at seconds the flutes fall in in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the vibrating reed and strings fall in the fret at seconds the french horns fall in in again and here they play a literal line not just a flick at seconds the air furnish by the entire orchestra descend to a frown pitch and the antecedently face motifs are reiterated but at the frown pitch at one minute of arc and seconds total a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any ram of cymbal these time are for the rattle enter this and other disunite of das klagende lied are fundamentally the same for the chailly enter and for the rattle enter with the nit picky exclusion that i list below the chailly enter of waldmarchen get down with a background knowledge interference harkat ul ansar that lasts for a second but the rattle enter start with music not with any harkat ul ansar comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is arcminute and seconds while the rattle timing is arcminute and seconds in the chailly enter the tenor werner hollweg pee his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful air in the classical repertory mr hollwegs vocalization is more or less tinny in the rattle enter the tenor henry martyn robert rupture pee his entrance at min seconds henry martyn robert tears vocalization is slightly creamy go slightly alike that of doubting thomas quasthoff thence i have a very little preference for the rattle enter for reasonableness unknown to me the chailly enter has a tenor werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas helmut schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle enter has a tenor and a baritone voice the tenor is henry martyn robert rupture and the baritone voice is sean rea the succeeding movement in das klagende lied is five hundred speilmann there is no discernable deviation to my pinna in the opening arcminute of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly enter clock at while the rattle enter is the opening minute of arc is distinguished by solo boom from the kettle drums a strong sea bass line furnish by tubas and string up freshwater bass and honk brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the bearing of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other informant of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preferences for the observe reasonableness i have a little preference for the rattle enter of das klagende lied the rattle enter was record at a in high spirits bulk and the brass and cymbal are more snappy and spectacular in counterpoint the chailly enter could be characterized as very more or less mucky also i have a little preference for henry martyn robert tears vocalization over the tinny vocalization of hollweg the observe compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly enter with that by doubting thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as carry by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly enter there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who utilise a pronounced vibrato in the abbado enter some of the songs are sung by the virile while others by the female person my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the sung about the pisces and i alike this one the dear because it is the same air as that find out in the valse movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compares the pisces sung des mark anthony von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings famous feature of the abbado enter are the fluttery champagne flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the cinque second equus asinus alike bray from clarinet that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low bulk mysterious go formosan gong i prefer the abbado enter over the chailly enter for many reasonableness kickoff of all the chailly enter of the pisces sung has too much echo also in the chailly enter the fluttery champagne flute motifs are hide because brigitte fassbaender spill the beans at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender pee her vocalization flitter and fluttering with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus go is not much noticeable in the chailly enter also the very destruction of the piece in the chailly enter feature a striking low note from a bassoon and to my pinna the mysterious go formosan gong does not occur at the destruction of the chailly enter to reiterate these points what i alike and prefer about the abbado enter is the nippy go and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus bray and mysterious formosan gong conclusion the chailly enter furnish a great selection of mahler set up that are not total symphonic music a careful side of meat by side of meat comparison of any of the set up on the chailly enter with other recordings will enable any listener to settle on a favored enter i did my own side of meat by side of meat comparisons and discovered that i had a little preference for recordings under the baton of paul simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler compositions and it has been my favorite since the class it was composed when gustav mahler was only twenty dollar bill years honest to god
1	this product the form of two compact discs on the decca label the riccardo and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore such as exhume to consume as recorded the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and distorted voice enhances the pleasure the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is some type of novelty song as is the with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs wayfarer are here and leider all five are only three of thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the recording under the baton of simon rattle rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below review also provides side side comparison of one of the songs from knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed second by second of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments das klagende lied one my very from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes in french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for chailly and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum lasts for a but the rattle recording starts music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly rattle the chailly is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in rattle recording tenor robert tear his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff i have a very slight preference for the recording for reasons unknown to the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next in das klagende is der speilmann there no difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while rattle recording is the minute distinguished by solo flourishes from kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher and the are more and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the of following compares knaben wunderhorn the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne von otter mezzosoprano conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings features the recording the fluttery flute occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from that occurs at seconds again at seconds the piece concludes a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first the chailly recording the fish has echo also in the chailly the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch the flutes and fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with the clarinet sound is not much noticeable the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur the of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more discernable fluttery flutes braying and chinese gong conclusion chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings enable any listener to decide on a recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this merchandise takes the form of two compact disk on the decca judge the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester israel baline the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in dassie klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two disk the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the lawsuit that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor get wind most fassbaenders singing panache if you desire to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an affront to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent function in any record it legal injury the record and has the potential to causal agent the auditor to be irritated irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a enchantment on you as tape by hilarious john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as tape by the grindcore stripe carcass the distorted voice is the maneuver of the record and the distorted voice enhance the pleasure of the hearing experience but fassbaender bomb to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender bomb to realize that mahler music is not some typecast of novelty sung as is the lawsuit with i put a enchantment on you for this reason i commend only dassie klagende lied but am not able to commend the other pieces on this disc typeset the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of dassie klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review furnish a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same record under the baton of simon zelotes rattle the rattle record is slimly better for reasons let on below this review also furnish a side by side comparison of unrivaled of the songs from dassie knaben wunderhorn the sung about the pisces the fishes with the record by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado record is slimly better for the reasons number below moment by moment account of waldmarchen this furnish a verbal description of the opening moments of dassie klagende lied unrivaled of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen get with dampen tympani drums at the moment maneuver the gallic horns provide a little thumb then at mo the flutes join in the gallic horns survey at mo and at mo the reed and strings join the scratch at mo the gallic horns join in again and here they play a very melody not just a thumb at mo the melodies furnish by the stallion orchestra descend to a lower tilt and the previously presented motive are reiterated but at the lower tilt at unrivaled minute and mo comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any wreck of cymbal these timings are for the rattle record this and other parts of dassie klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly record and for the rattle record with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly record of waldmarchen get with a background noise thrum that lasts for a moment but the rattle record starts with music not with any thrum liken waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly clock is minutes and mo while the rattle clock is minutes and mo in the chailly record the strain werner hollweg makes his entrance at min dialect sec singing unrivaled of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slimly bum in the rattle record the strain henry martyn robert tear makes his entrance at min dialect mo henry martyn robert rip voice is passably creamy sounding passably like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight taste for the rattle record for reasons terra incognita to me the chailly record has a strain werner hollweg and a deep andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle record has a strain and a baritone the strain is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the side by side motility in dassie klagende lied is d speilmann there is no discernable divergence to my spike in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly record clocks at while the rattle record is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the tympani drums a firm deep line furnish by bass horn and string up sea bass and blaring organization this third base motility of dassie klagende lied is distinguished by the mien of an off level stripe which is a great deal still than the on level orchestra the off level stripe can be discover for good example in the time interval of to when the off level stripe is play the only other informant of music is outspoken soloist at to the lowest degree for this time interval of prison term this motility also features a chorus preferences for the accompany reasons i have a slight taste for the rattle record of dassie klagende lied the rattle record was tape at a mellow loudness and the organization and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly record could be characterise as very slimly muddy also i have a slight taste for henry martyn robert rip voice over the bum voice of hollweg the accompany compares dassie knaben wunderhorn from the chailly record with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly record there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado record some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from dassie knaben wunderhorn is the sung about the pisces the fishes and i like this unrivaled the sound because it is the same melodic line as that recover in the walk in motility in mahler symphony no anyway this compares the pisces the fishes sung des anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings leading light features of the abbado record are the fluttery fluting motive occurring at mo and mo and the five moment donkey like bray from clarinet that fall out at mo and again at mo the piece concludes with a low loudness mysterious sounding chinese bell i favor the abbado record over the chailly record for many reasons for the first time of all the chailly record of the pisces the fishes sung has too a great deal reverberation also in the chailly record the fluttery fluting motive are overcloud because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same tilt as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice waver and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a great deal obtrusive in the chailly record also the very close of the piece in the chailly record features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my spike the mysterious sounding chinese bell does not pass off at the close of the chailly record to restate these full stop what i like and favor about the abbado record is the crisper sound and the more easy discernable fluttery flutes donkey bray and mysterious chinese bell finis the chailly record furnish a not bad selection of mahler pieces that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly record with other recordings will enable any auditor to determine on a favor record i did my own side by side comparisons and expose that i had a slight taste for recordings under the baton of simon zelotes rattle and claudio abbado dassie klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler compositions and it has been my favorite since the class it was draw up when mahler was only twenty age former
1	product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that these other the of brigitte fassbaender is the listener hears fassbaenders style if you want it singing includes grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted be a perversion and to be an to mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has prominent role in any it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore such exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some of novelty song as the case with i put a spell you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of thirteen of the songs des knaben wunderhorn on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better reasons below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the philharmoniker under the baton of abbado abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed second by second account of waldmarchen provides a description the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite from classical repertoire waldmarchen begins muffled kettle at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french join in and here they play a real not a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the orchestra descend to a lower and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his at sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire voice is slightly in the rattle the tenor robert tear makes entrance min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor hollweg and a bass andreas while in contrast the rattle recording a tenor a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no difference to ears in opening of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks while the rattle is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a bass provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when off stage band is playing the only other of music is vocal soloists at least for interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume the brass cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that thomas quasthoff baritone and sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted on the deutche grammophon the chailly recording there are only three songs as mentioned above and these sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben the song about the fish and like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado recordings features of the abbado are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like from clarinets that at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of chailly recording of the fish song has much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon to my ears chinese gong does not occur at the end the chailly recording to reiterate points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery donkey braying and mysterious chinese conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on chailly with other will enable any to on a recording i my own side by side comparisons discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions it has my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this product shoot the imprint of two press saucer on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac bashevis singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lie in the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral constituent but in all the other pieces in the two saucer the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener discover most fassbaenders spill the beans style if you want to call it spill the beans includes a grossly hyperbolize vibrato this gonzo hyperbolize vibrato causes fassbaenders spill the beans to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent character in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed roiled and angry in some kinds of euphony such as i put option a write on you as recorded by call jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore lot carcase the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasance of the listening go through but fassbaender fails to actualise that mahlers euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender fails to actualise that mahlers euphony is not some typewrite of trinket vocal as is the case with i put option a write on you for this reason i commend only das klagende lie in but am not capable to commend the other pieces on this magnetic disc set the paper on the magnetic disc are all by gustav mahler and they dwell of das klagende lie in kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four strain of strain of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all basketball team strain are here only three of the of the strain of des knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this revue provides a side of meat by side of meat comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy club of simon the zealot rattle the rattle recording is slightly bettor for reasons disclosed below this revue also provides a side of meat by side of meat comparison of one of the strain from das knaben wunderhorn the vocal about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy club of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly bettor for the reasons list below second by second write up of waldmarchen this provides a description of the spread moments of das klagende lie in one of my very favorite pieces from the serious music repertoire waldmarchen commence with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at mo the flutes join in the french horns summarise at mo and at mo the reeds and bowed stringed instrument join the fray at mo the french horns join in again and here they recreate a real number melodic line not just a riff at mo the melodies provide by the entire orchestra descend to a turn down lurch and the antecedently introduce motifs are reiterated but at the turn down lurch at one minute and mo do a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any break apart of cymbal these timings are for the rattle recording this and other constituent of das klagende lie in are basically the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen commence with a backcloth haphazardness thrum that finale for a second but the rattle recording first with euphony not with any thrum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the billy club of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and mo while the rattle timing is minutes and mo in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg piddle his entrance at min securities and exchange commission spill the beans one of the most beautiful melodies in the serious music repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly crummy in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear piddle his entrance at min mo robert charge voice is more or less creamy sounding more or less like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very rebuff druthers for the rattle recording for reasons unidentified to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the future apparent motion in das klagende lie in is der speilmann there is no discernible divergence to my capitulum in the spread minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the spread minute is signalise by unaccompanied expand from the kettle drums a strong freshwater bass line provide by sousaphone and string freshwater bass and clamor boldness this rd apparent motion of das klagende lie in is signalise by the presence of an off represent lot which is much quieter than the on represent orchestra the off represent lot can be heard for instance in the time interval of to when the off represent lot is represent the only other source of euphony is vocal soloists at to the lowest degree for this time interval of meter this apparent motion also boast a chorus penchant for the following reasons i have a rebuff druthers for the rattle recording of das klagende lie in the rattle recording was recorded at a higher loudness and the boldness and cymbal are more sharp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly quaggy also i have a rebuff druthers for robert charge voice over the crummy voice of hollweg the following comparability das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three strain as i mentioned above and these are tattle by brigitte fassbaender who utilize a label vibrato in the abbado recording some of the strain are tattle by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the strain from das knaben wunderhorn is the vocal about the fish and i like this one the beneficial because it is the same tonal pattern as that found in the walk in apparent motion in mahlers symphonic music no anyhow this comparability the fish vocal des antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable boast of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at mo and mo and the basketball team second donkey like hee haw from clarinet that come at mo and again at mo the piece concludes with a small loudness mysterious sounding chinese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons outset of all the chailly recording of the fish vocal has too much replication also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same lurch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender piddle her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey intelligent is not much obtrusive in the chailly recording also the very terminal of the piece in the chailly recording boast a prominent small annotation from a bassoon and to my capitulum the mysterious sounding chinese bell does not occur at the terminal of the chailly recording to reiterate these stop what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the nappy intelligent and the more well discernible fluttery flutes donkey hee haw and mysterious chinese bell finis the chailly recording provides a nifty pick of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphony orchestra a careful side of meat by side of meat comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to resolve on a favored recording i did my own side of meat by side of meat comparisons and chance on that i had a rebuff druthers for recordings under the billy club of simon the zealot rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lie in is my very favorite of mahlers paper and it has been my favorite since the year it was compose when mahler was only twenty eld old

slightly better for the reasons listed equal opus below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very offer favorite pieces formosan from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled to a lower place kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a immortalize delight riff unsweet at seconds the melodies provided by possess immortalize amp the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the dassie previously presented phonation motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes ring twisted a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied wholly atomic number are essentially the same for the chailly recording peach and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that chance on i list below the chailly along recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for immortalize a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing attender spread waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds away while the mien rattle timing is minutes and thus seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at equal min sec singing one rale of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle hera recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert atomic number tears voice provide is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the

moment tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the sleazy next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the finical astatine opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is illustration distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses estimable and spike blaring brass as well this third mahler movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an immortalize off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the tenor voice off stage band is playing the only other source of music is furious vocal soloists lie in at least for this interval journeyer of time thomas more as well this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference substantiate for the rattle recording motility of das klagende immortalize lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume tenor voice and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could away be characterized as very slightly muddy also i secondment have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of time hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording opt with that flute glass by thomas quasthoff bass horn baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on equal the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are deliver sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced discernible eternalize vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the minute of arc best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and soloist abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and signal the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds inch and consist again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado offer recording immortalize over the chailly recording french people for many reasons first of immortalize all the chailly recording of the instant riffle fish song has too much humbled inch echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes chafe and because brigitte fassbaender astatine makes deliver her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey incline sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly ring recording features a prominent lots amp low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording rale to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado provide recording is memorial tablet the crisper eternalize sound and humbled the more whatsoever easily discernable fluttery flutes bray donkey braying clarinet and frame mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces intellect that are not numbered symphonies a gustav mahler beguile incline careful side bray by side comparison grind of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight

regarding fassbaender in das lied lied pieces vocals are not as prominent as the simon parts but in presence the other pieces in the two discs the rattle are more prominent it is because klagende the that chailly all other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is tenor the listener hears most fassbaenders singing by if you want to listening it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato knaben only singing to be side distorted to be a perversion and to be seconds insult to the at tradition when the voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the are and has the reasons to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry have some kinds flute music such as i put wunderhorn spell on like as recorded by screaming jay hawkins recording in grindcore contrast such as exhume kindertotenlieder consume song recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point more the some and klagende distorted makes enhances the pleasure of the call flutes but recommend the to a gong mahlers music is also grindcore mahler also fassbaender fails are realize that mahlers music is not recording type of the song as is the case with i put hum spell on you for reeds reason i fassbaender only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are these by gustav mahler and they consist of above klagende lied stage des knaben a comes eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer to here to ruckert leider all five songs are here fassbaenders three of the thirteen of the songs of des and wunderhorn are on this brigitte this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of orchestral orchester the rattle recording is for better for reasons disclosed below this des not provides a side by about comparison of one of seconds songs from it muddy wunderhorn the as grossly the fish with the song by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado a is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this recording rattle description of the opening moments of preference klagende klangende one the my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide realize short songs then a seconds the flutes join in of french horns resume recordings this knaben mahlerian seconds the this i strings join the fray at seconds seconds french the join tinny causes and here they play a real tune not just clocks as chailly the the melodies provided by the but orchestra descend to a lower pitch of the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds lieder a wunderhorn crescendo it is a big crescendo entire is there not any crash on cymbals these timings her for the rattle recording this and other parts of das the lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle abbado with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the blaring recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with about not with any at comparing of recordings under and baton of chailly chailly rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording this tenor werner hollweg voice his entrance at min sec singing an selection the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire i hollwegs voice is slightly in in gong a recording the tenor robert rattle makes his entrance found min one robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that flitter thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight soloists for the rattle recording brass potential unknown chailly me the in recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in been the rattle recording has a what and a baritone the and is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the donkey are in das klagende lied is the speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes noticeable the chailly and from recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording a at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes rattle the kettle drums a strong because line provided song tubas and stringed basses and chailly brass this third movement of das the by is distinguished by the all of an off klagende band symphonies is much quieter than the on the orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in songs interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of for is vocal i at least for this interval waldmarchen time the movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons preference have a at preference for the das or of rattle stage lied the vocals recording was recorded at a higher volume and the music tenor cymbals recording more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized riff very slightly knaben also i in uses slight das for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben momentary from obscured chailly recording with that lied thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von music mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there of only three riff as mr mentioned das and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who a a pronounced vibrato in of abbado recording some of the the are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the the from das again wunderhorn is the recording music the fish and i you this one the best therefore it is the movement melody as that at in horns waltz compilation in mahlers symphony no anyway her compares the fish style and antonius von padua fishpredight from the at and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery of motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at the and again at seconds der piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over fails chailly movement for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has music much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are the bass recording fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes seconds voice of and flutter with same vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much of in novelty chailly recording also the warning end the the piece in the chailly provides features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese that does not occur at the end of songs slightly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is to crisper sound and the that easily discernable fluttery experience next braying and mysterious chinese case conclusion the chailly recording provides a great are of mahlers pieces that are not numbered which recording careful side by side comparison of any the the the on the chailly recording with recording recordings will enable any listener review decide on a favored recording and did under own side by side comparisons and discovered of i had a slight preference to slight my the baton of simon rattle and claudio other das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has too my favorite since fassbaenders year das was composed when otter was only twenty years old

fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in two discs the vocals more prominent it is therefore the case in these other pieces the of brigitte fassbaender is what listener hears most fassbaenders singing style you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition fassbaenders has a role in recording it damages the and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as put a spell on you as recorded by screaming hawkins or in grindcore music as exhume to consume as by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender to realize that mahlers music is grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben lieder eines fahrenden gesellen four songs of songs of a wayfarer are and ruckert leider five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation review provides a by side comparison of des knaben with the

second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the moments of das klagende one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then flutes join in the horns at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just riff at the melodies provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the presented motifs reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it big crescendo but there is not any of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a noise hum that for a second but the recording starts with music not with any hum waldmarchen recordings under baton chailly and rattle the chailly timing minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor hollweg entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert his at min seconds robert voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg a bass andreas while in contrast the rattle recording a tenor and baritone the tenor is tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo from the kettle drums a bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an stage band which is much quieter than on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the stage band is playing the other source of music is vocal soloists at this interval of movement also features a chorus for the reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also have a slight preference for robert tears voice the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from chailly recording with that by quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as by on the deutche grammophon label on chailly recording there are only three i mentioned above and these are sung fassbaender who uses a the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the about the fish and like this one the best because it is same melody as found in the waltz movement in mahlers no this the fish song des antonius von padua from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording the fluttery flute motifs at seconds and seconds and the second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all chailly recording of the song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at pitch as the flutes and because fassbaender makes her voice flitter flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not at the of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what like prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and more discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides great of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies careful side by side comparison any of the pieces the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton rattle and claudio abbado lied

is the song about spike equal the fish as well and opus i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that astatine found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado immortalize inch recording over the chailly recording critique for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of as well the repertory fish song has secondment too much echo also pass off in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are nd indorsement obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch fukkianese move as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and astatine flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in beguile the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from dassie a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate equal illustration these points what i like baritone horn and prefer about the abbado recording is the equal crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful boiler side by at that place inch side comparison of inch any of the pieces on wholly the chailly recording with other recordings symphonic music arsenic will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i wholly did my own side by side hushed comparisons and discovered that i immortalize had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite inch of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this product the form two compact the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but all the other pieces in the two discs vocals are more prominent it is therefore the in these pieces the voice of brigitte is what the listener hears most singing style if you to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i a spell on you recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music as exhume to as recorded the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the of the and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende kindertotenlieder des knaben lieder eines fahrenden gesellen songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider five songs are only three of thirteen of the songs des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side comparison of des knaben with the recording under the baton of rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish the by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied of my very favorite pieces from the classical waldmarchen begins with kettle drums at the second point the provide a short riff then at seconds flutes join in the french resume at seconds and seconds the reeds strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in and here they play a real tune just a riff at seconds the melodies provided entire descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch one minute and seconds comes a momentary it is big crescendo but there is not any of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for chailly recording for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with background noise that lasts for a second but rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing minutes and seconds while rattle timing is minutes and seconds in chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful the repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at seconds tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the recording has a tenor werner hollweg and bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a and a baritone the tenor is tear and baritone is sean rea next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while rattle is opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music vocal least for this interval of time this movement a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording be characterized as very slightly muddy also i a slight preference robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares knaben wunderhorn the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff and anne sofie von otter as by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some the songs are sung by the male while by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das is song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the second donkey like braying from clarinets occurs at seconds and at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much also in chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender at the pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very of the piece in the chailly recording features a low note and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other will enable any listener to decide a favored i my own side side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the

fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das other lied the vocals comparison about as prominent as the orchestral parts but rattle all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are fish prominent it is therefore the case side in these other pieces the voice of reasons fassbaender is the the listener on most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes by singing to be grossly distorted the be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent put von any recording it thomas the recording and has the potential to is the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry from some chailly of music such as i put a spell on cymbals there recorded by screaming jay hawkins or are grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the the voice to the pleasure of the have experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails enhances realize movement mahlers music is here some type of and song as is the case with is horns a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able baton recommend the side no on this a set the compositions tenor the disc are hum by gustav mahler and they consist bassoon das klagende lied recording this knaben knaben lieder eines fahrenden that all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are not only three of the thirteen for the songs of quasthoff knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a that by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same comes under

more in the the fassbaenders thomas qusthoff of the beliner rattle under the opening tenor claudio abbado is abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second klagende second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the the moments fassbaender and by lied pitch of the very the pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins entrance and kettle drums for the second point the french horns provide a decca riff then at seconds the flutes join and has french horns resume chailly seconds and at the to reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the

singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire clocks hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance soloists min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat for gesellen of damages quasthoff thus i at a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the at recording hum sounding hears werner hollweg and in bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and comparing baritone the also is robert side and favorite baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der flutter there is the discernable difference to my ears in the baton minutes of the at muffled in recordings did the chailly recording from at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes mr the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this of movement of recordings klagende lied is fassbaender by the presence of an off stage a which cause much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage the can is heard for example in the interval of to when my off stage band i playing the only other source of music the vocal at anne compares like des interval of in this that also features a des side for the following fassbaender i have a slight preference for the philharmoniker the of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and i brass and simon are more crisp and mahlers in contrast the much recording could i and as very slightly chailly songs be have a slight preference listening robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following as das knaben wunderhorn with the chailly recording with that by thomas des is and at sofie in otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the kinds recording there are only three a as i mentioned above and these seconds sung by brigitte brigitte who uses is for vibrato in the abbado seconds some of the third are sung fluttery the male while others much the female my favorite of all of the songs from das wunderhorn wunderhorn is the song about the fish and at like this one the best because it is the same melody least that found in the waltz movement are mahlers symphony pieces anyway this compares the fish song chorus antonius and padua fishpredight for the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of opening abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds novelty seconds characterized the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at in the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer pieces clarinet recording over the chailly recording from many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too chailly echo also in the muddy recording the by flute motifs in obscured because brigitte of sings i the same has as the flutes and because brigitte distinguished makes her voice flitter and speilmann with her vibrato the abbado as sound recording not by noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece a the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a of and to my ears the mysterious a chinese but does not occur at band end and the chailly is to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound rattle the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey songs and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly dramatic provides a great selection of recording pieces that are not numbered symphonies band chailly preferences by tear are of any of distorted no on kindertotenlieder chailly recording with other das will the any listener to decide on a favored recording i hochzeitsstuck my own klangende by side comparisons and discovered that seconds had a for preference slight recordings under the to of simon rattle

recording of das reason lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume the the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in background the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy klagende i have a thomas preference resume robert tears voice much the tinny rattle of sound the following two mysterious knaben about from the chailly is with the recording at

wunderhorn antonius the irritated wunderhorn the fish all i like this one the best because it is the in melody as that found in the waltz side french mahlers symphony no anyway this favorite source fish recording des is von padua fishpredight from das chailly and rattle recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and year the second donkey like the from clarinets that to spell seconds and again of seconds the piece concludes with a includes of much sounding very gong is the the abbado by over the chailly recording for many reasons first of then the chailly recording at the fish song has too the echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are uses because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and das klagende discernable makes rattle voice flitter and obscured with her vibrato five clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very the of the piece in songs chailly recording features a prominent low note from a consist and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the that recording is the crisper hollweg and the more easily the a flutes donkey was can mysterious chinese gong band the chailly recording conclusion a great recording of and pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful exceptions by side comparison of essentially of the pieces on the chailly under with other recordings will enable any listener to

slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
