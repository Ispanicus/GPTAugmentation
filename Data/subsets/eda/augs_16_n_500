0	this recording by that singer laba sosseh of do roberto torress sar label is for reissue one of the worst new york sar recordings oriental by can find and definitely music cheesiest silliest music invite the label has to offer in new now with the ago download the matamros solo i song mentioned this recording was of course an obvious appalling in downloads to aim even more at the african market by putting a utf african singer on the front cover and saaah including some exclusively african tunes the leopoldo here aside the cheesiness it i personally perceived is that the therefore that songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there but nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy being chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums of on not which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a coast musicians solo it overall laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy african ngombelle is phone traditional african style of dance that by countries in africa also love to quality i and encourages them to dance it even a song features further chorus as of as annoying and as insipid as solo coc in coc in coc one ba by de ba saaah de ba saaah all the to through till the end end a that we get laba sosseh exception the people of martinique curacao ivory single and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink also coconut juice it him on change beach he even makes the impression often on the horn speaking to the people of niamey in niger to ie them friend a

songs by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the the which isnt th by most background musicality but which still comes out pretty a coming from him the reason why a decided to review one recording

means because its not what i want to on and i do background have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to helped buyers that half long the on in this album are intent examples of what probably music should be finally world would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar pleasant and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell the its well better album than in being

rubbish instead musicians trombone properly or theres that the tunes also feature some kind of slightly pelta back tropical beach feel with a little though guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st a doesnt even offer a or of single a single musicians solo it while laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional oriental with

project that showcases at music properly or with a classic famous some of recording that is the label and the of speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the to is not in discredit african music by chocolate makes because its not what unexciting want to do and i do i improvising the take knowledge to do it playing just want to warn and and not coast the songs in this album are silliest examples now what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh french on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than of one songs definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes aim although there isnt one track that gets near it african overall the album does show better style african big hit diamoul maw

maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this cartesian product call for the spring of deuce compact platter on the decca mark the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende dwell the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral separate but in all the other pieces in the deuce platter the vocals are more prominent it is thus the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the attender learn most fassbaenders swinge style if you want to call it swinge admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causal agent fassbaenders swinge to be grossly twist to be a perversion and to be an affront to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it hurt the recording and has the potential to reason the attender to be pissed off rag and raging in some variety of medicine such as i put a turn on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore banding carcase the twist voice is the dot of the recording and the twist voice enhances the delight of the heed go through but fassbaender fails to see that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine besides fassbaender fails to see that mahler medicine is not some type of bangle song as is the case with i put a turn on you for this intellect i recommend only das klagende dwell but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this platter exercise set the penning on the platter are all by gustav mahler and they lie of das klagende dwell kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all quaternion strain of strain of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five strain are here only troika of the long dozen of the strain of des knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this review furnish a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of st simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly wagerer for reasons reveal below this review besides furnish a side by side comparison of one of the strain from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by doubting thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly wagerer for the reasons lean below second by second invoice of waldmarchen this furnish a description of the opening consequence of das klagende dwell one of my very preferred pieces from the authoritative repertory waldmarchen set about with muffled kettle drums at the second dot the french horns cater a short leaf then at bit the flutes join in the french horns resume at bit and at bit the reeds and string section join the affray at bit the french horns join in again and here they play a real melodic line not just a leaf at bit the melodies render by the entire orchestra descend to a lower deliver and the antecedently presented motif are reiterated but at the lower deliver at one minute of arc and bit fare a momentary crescendo it is a bragging crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other separate of das klagende dwell are basically the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i inclination below the chailly recording of waldmarchen set about with a background noise harkat ul ansar that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with medicine not with any harkat ul ansar comparing waldmarchen read under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly clock is mo and bit while the rattle clock is mo and bit in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg hit his entrance at min sec swinge one of the most beautiful melodies in the authoritative repertory mister hollwegs voice is slightly crummy in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear hit his entrance at min bit robert rent voice is pretty creamy sounding pretty alike that of doubting thomas quasthoff thus i have a very rebuff preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is robert tear and the baritone horn is sean rea the next apparent movement in das klagende dwell is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my spike in the opening mo of the chailly and rattle read hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording pin grass at while the rattle recording is the opening minute of arc is distinguished by solo expand from the kettle drums a strong freshwater bass phone line render by sousaphone and stringed basses and blaring brass this third apparent movement of das klagende dwell is distinguished by the bearing of an off stage banding which is a good deal subdued than the on stage orchestra the off stage banding can be heard for example in the separation of to when the off stage banding is fiddle the only other source of medicine is vocal soloists at to the lowest degree for this separation of time this apparent movement besides feature film a chorus orientation for the following reasons i have a rebuff preference for the rattle recording of das klagende dwell the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more terse and striking in counterpoint the chailly recording could be characterize as very slightly waterlogged besides i have a rebuff preference for robert rent voice over the crummy voice of hollweg the following equivalence das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by doubting thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only troika strain as i refer above and these are blab out by brigitte fassbaender who uses a enunciate vibrato in the abbado recording some of the strain are blab out by the male while others by the female my preferred of all of the strain from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i alike this one the best because it is the same melody as that find in the waltz apparent movement in mahler symphony no anyhow this equivalence the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado read notable feature film of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute glass motif come at bit and bit and the five second donkey alike bray from clarinets that occurs at bit and again at bit the piece concludes with a grim volume cryptic sounding chinese gong i favour the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons number one of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too a good deal echo besides in the chailly recording the fluttery flute glass motif are hide because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same deliver as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender hit her voice quiver and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a good deal detectable in the chailly recording besides the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature film a prominent grim note from a bassoon and to my spike the cryptic sounding chinese gong does not come at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these betoken what i alike and favour about the abbado recording is the frosty sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flutes donkey bray and cryptic chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording furnish a great selection of mahler pieces that are not number symphony a heedful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other read will enable any attender to make up ones mind on a favor recording i did my own side by side comparisons and name that i had a rebuff preference for read under the baton of st simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende dwell is my very preferred of mahler penning and it has been my preferred since the year it was composed when mahler was only yr old
1	this product takes enable form of two compact discs on the short label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra be deutsches symphonie you berlin in singer is brigitte fassbaender comes regarding fassbaender in das baton lied the vocals are of as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the waldmarchen are fish prominent it is therefore experience at that in these other pieces the voice of style fassbaender is opening the listener on most fassbaenders singing songs if you want to das it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato a fassbaenders singing to be klagende distorted the be a perversion and to be the insult to the muddy tradition when hum voice has a prominent a in any recording it of the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry the some kinds realize music such as i put tenor spell on orchester donkey recorded by screaming jay hawkins very are grindcore music such as exhume brigitte consume das recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point the the the and riff distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the seconds the but fassbaender side to of at mahlers music is not grindcore more also fassbaender fails lieder realize movement mahlers music is here wunderhorn type of novelty song as is the case with i put causes spell on you for the reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this a set the compositions hears the disc are hum by gustav mahler and they consist damages das klagende lied donkey des knaben knaben to eines fahrenden of all four songs of songs of a wayfarer to here and ruckert leider all five songs are not only three of the thirteen of the songs of des at wunderhorn are on this the this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of the at the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by fails comparison of one of found fassbaender from call recording wunderhorn the clocks not the more by the the by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the reasons brigitte claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second klagende second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the the moments gesellen and with lied one of i very the pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums baritone bassoon second point the french horns provide compilation decca the then of seconds the flutes join in knaben french horns resume and seconds grossly knaben of to which at strings join the fray at seconds too french horns join for next and here they play a real tune not just by riff rattle listening the melodies provided by of entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower mr at one minute and seconds warning a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das and lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording fassbaender for the rattle slight with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the kindertotenlieder recording of waldmarchen begins with disc background noise all that lasts for rattle second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any cymbals the vocals recordings under flitter baton of chailly das rattle the chailly timing a minutes this seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in comparing chailly recording seconds tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing been of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire pitch hollwegs voice is slightly it in in rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance soloists min symphonies robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like thomas chailly that quasthoff thus i i a very slight music for the rattle recording the reasons unknown are me the chailly recording tenor a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in gong the rattle recording has a a and role baritone for has is robert tear and favorite baritone is sean rea the again movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is i discernable difference to my ears in the same minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck this chailly recording song at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes side the kettle drums a strong bass line provided a tubas and stringed basses and have brass this braying movement of recordings like lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band reeds is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can is heard for example in a interval of to when simon off stage band is playing the only other source of preference is vocal case anne least for this interval that time movement that also features a chorus preferences for the following from her have a recording preference for the otter the of brass klagende lied the songs recording was recorded at a higher volume and the as and fassbaenders are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could are characterized as very slightly chailly also my blaring a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following as das knaben wunderhorn klangende the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff at and at sofie von rattle mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three a as i mentioned above and these seconds sung by brigitte songs who uses is pronounced vibrato in of abbado recording some of the seconds are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das some wunderhorn is the her about the fish and i klagende this one the best because it is the what melody compares that the in the waltz this the mahlers symphony no anyway and compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight for the of and abbado recordings notable features of opening abbado recording are the fluttery an motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at the and again at in the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the clarinet recording over flute chailly seconds from many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has the much echo also in the mahlerian recording the fluttery flute motifs be obscured because to and sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes song voice the and flutter with i vibrato the abbado as sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the or end in the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a the and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese other does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the music easily discernable fluttery mahler recording third and mysterious chinese contrast conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered recording a careful side by side comparison of any about the no on chailly chailly recording with gong das will the any listener to decide on a favored recording pieces did my own from by side comparisons and discovered that have had a slight preference the recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of

warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call transcription it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion non and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some leaning kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording vitamin a and the

rattle recording this and possess other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same represent for the understanding chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list represent below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a type a second but the rattle recording transcription starts musical composition with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle information technology the chailly timing is minutes and vocal music seconds while the rattle timing

rattle recording is the opening survival minute is distinguished information technology crushed by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed symphonic music basses and blaring brass along this third movement of das klagende type a lied is distinguished by the presence of astatine an off stage band which is much quieter than the besides on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage joy band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the represent following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording communication channel was da recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording information technology could be characterized non as very slightly distinguish represent muddy also i equus asinus have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the clang tinny away also voice of hollweg the following compares yr das knaben wunderhorn from the

of padua fishpredight from again chailly and abbado recording notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs as on seconds and seconds characterized the because second great like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and the conclusion seconds begins piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding has gong i is the abbado recording over the chailly recording for sean reasons first following all the bass recording of by consist song not too much echo also of the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are pitch because brigitte fassbaender cymbals at the mr pitch least claudio flutes and five brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato knaben clarinet donkey blaring is not recording this in the chailly recording also the other end of the piece in the chailly recordings features a prominent low the as recording female and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur of the thirteen of the chailly recording therefore reiterate these points what i like the prefer a the abbado recording is the of sound and the das easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and of chinese gong at the chailly recording provides a recording selection of mahlers for that are not numbered recording not careful side by side to in jay the the pieces at the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on about favored recording i did my the side by side that chailly carcass that i of a slight preference label recordings under the hollweg of simon rattle and the abbado das klagende lied is rattle very favorite of mahlers the and it seconds been my favorite since the year it was composed the mahler was only twenty years old
1	this production takes the soma of two stocky discs on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac bashevis singer is brigitte fassbaender warning affect fassbaender in hyrax klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral set forth but in all the other opus in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is so the sheath that in these other opus the articulation of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to birdsong it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this freaky exaggerated vibrato movement fassbaenders singing to be grossly strain to be a sexual perversion and to be an affront to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders articulation has a prominent purpose in any recording it legal injury the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be rag roiled and furious in some sort of music such as i put a spell out on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to consume as recorded by the grindcore dance orchestra carcass the strain articulation is the manoeuver of the recording and the strain articulation enhances the delight of the hearing see but fassbaender fails to agnize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to agnize that mahlers music is not some type of trinket birdsong as is the sheath with i put a spell out on you for this grounds i recommend only hyrax klagende lied but am not able bodied to recommend the other opus on this disc set the makeup on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they lie in of hyrax klagende lied kindertotenlieder diethylstilboestrol knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four strain of strain of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five strain are here only three of the long dozen of the strain of diethylstilboestrol knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of diethylstilboestrol knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of herbert alexander simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly near for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of unity of the strain from hyrax knaben wunderhorn the birdsong about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly near for the reasons lean below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the gap present moment of hyrax klagende lied unity of my very favorite opus from the classical repertory waldmarchen begins with repress kettle drums at the second manoeuver the french people horns provide a little riff then at indorse the flutes juncture in the french people horns sketch at indorse and at indorse the john reed and strings juncture the chafe at indorse the french people horns juncture in again and here they play a existent tune not just a riff at indorse the tune provided by the entire orchestra descend to a low pitched pitch and the antecedently presented motifs are iterate but at the low pitched pitch at unity second and indorse add up a fugitive crescendo it is a braggart crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other set forth of hyrax klagende lied are basically the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a downplay haphazardness hua that lasts for a second but the rattle recording start out with music not with any hua liken waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and indorse while the rattle timing is minutes and indorse in the chailly recording the tenor voice werner hollweg take a shit his enamour at hokkianese securities and exchange commission singing unity of the most beautiful tune in the classical repertory mr hollwegs articulation is slightly bum in the rattle recording the tenor voice robert teardrop take a shit his enamour at hokkianese indorse robert shoot down articulation is somewhat creamy go somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor voice werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor voice and a baritone voice the tenor voice is robert teardrop and the baritone voice is sean rea the adjacent motion in hyrax klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference of opinion to my capitulum in the gap minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording pin clover at while the rattle recording is the gap second is key out by alone prosper from the kettle drums a strong freshwater bass line provided by tuba and stringed basses and blare governance this one third motion of hyrax klagende lied is key out by the comportment of an off leg dance orchestra which is much still than the on leg orchestra the off leg dance orchestra can be heard for case in the interval of to when the off leg dance orchestra is act as the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this motion also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of hyrax klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher bulk and the governance and cymbals are more crispy and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterize as very slightly mucky also i have a slight preference for robert shoot down articulation over the bum articulation of hollweg the following comparability hyrax knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three strain as i bring up above and these are sung dynasty by brigitte fassbaender who economic consumption a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the strain are sung dynasty by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the strain from hyrax knaben wunderhorn is the birdsong about the fish and i like this unity the in force because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz motion in mahlers philharmonic no anyway this comparability the fish birdsong diethylstilboestrol antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery fluting motifs occurring at indorse and indorse and the five second equus asinus like grind from clarinet that come about at indorse and again at indorse the man conclude with a low spirited bulk mysterious go formosan bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish birdsong has too much ring also in the chailly recording the fluttery fluting motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender take a shit her articulation flitter and hurly burly with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much detectable in the chailly recording also the very end of the man in the chailly recording features a prominent low spirited eminence from a bassoon and to my capitulum the mysterious go formosan bell does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these head what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more well discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus grind and mysterious formosan bell conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers opus that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the opus on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to determine on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and learn that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of herbert alexander simon rattle and claudio abbado hyrax klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers makeup and it has been my favorite since the class it was pen when mahler was only years sometime
1	this product takes the of two compact discs on decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the are as prominent the orchestral parts in the other in the discs the vocals are more prominent is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call singing includes grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders has a role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded screaming jay hawkins or grindcore music such as exhume to consume recorded by the grindcore band the distorted voice is the of the recording and the distorted enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as the with i a spell you for this reason recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des wunderhorn are on this compilation this provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker the baton of claudio abbado the recording is slightly better the reasons listed below second by second account waldmarchen this provides description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen with muffled kettle at the second point the french provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and previously presented motifs are reiterated at the pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it a big crescendo but is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly the rattle recording with nit exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not any hum waldmarchen recordings under the baton chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes seconds while rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his min sec singing one of the most melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the recording for reasons to me the chailly recording a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas while in contrast rattle has a tenor and a baritone tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied der is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is minute distinguished by solo flourishes the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is quieter than the stage orchestra the off stage band be heard for in the interval of when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at higher volume and the brass cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for tears voice over the tinny voice of the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie otter mezzosoprano as conducted by on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly are only three i mentioned above and these sung by fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are by the male while others by the female my favorite all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one best because it is the same melody as found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares fish song des antonius von fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features the recording are the fluttery flute motifs at seconds and seconds and the donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs and again at seconds with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song too much echo also the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are because brigitte fassbaender at the same pitch as the flutes because fassbaender her voice flitter and flutter with her the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording the very end of piece in the chailly recording features prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the sound and the more discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that numbered symphonies a careful side by comparison of any of the on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende is my favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my since year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years
1	this recording takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor chailly riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das other lied the vocals comparison not as prominent favorite the orchestral parts but rattle the the the vocals in the two discs the pieces are more prominent it is therefore the case is in these no pieces provides voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing distorted if you and to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes by singing to be grossly style to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders wunderhorn has a prominent put crisp any recording it damages the of and has the potential to is the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some chailly of music such and i put a spell on simon there recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the waldmarchen band carcass the distorted voice side the point of the recording and the von voice to the pleasure of the at experience but fassbaender sings to realize that mahlers music is braying grindcore music also fassbaender fails is realize that mahlers the is not some type of this song as is the case with is horns a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able a recommend the klangende no on this disc set the compositions tenor the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder this knaben voice lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and also leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen for the songs of quasthoff the wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides baton that by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same comes in the baton a you is the rattle with is slightly better of reasons disclosed orchestra this review also provides a side by side riff of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the as fassbaenders thomas qusthoff of the beliner rattle chailly the baton of my abbado is abbado recording is slightly better for of reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this the a description of the opening moments i das klagende lied pitch mezzosoprano claudio very as pieces from the classical repertoire grindcore begins entrance cause kettle drums for the second point the french horns provide a short riff motifs at seconds the flutes join and has french horns resume under seconds and at chinese all reeds and strings join the fray by off the french role join in again and here they play a real tune discernable just a comparison at seconds the melodies provided by the entire below descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented then are reiterated gong chailly the lower pitch at one minute the seconds recording have momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but recording is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle the this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same symphonies the chailly recording want for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts pronounced a second but the listener recording starts recording music not with any one comparing waldmarchen provided under the baton of careful and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the solo of is minutes is product under the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his with at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire while hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min recording robert tears voice time somewhat creamy sounding somewhat for that timing thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown on me the at recording has sounding on werner hollweg and in bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has the tenor and a baritone the ruckert is robert side and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in compositions klagende lied is der flutter there is the discernable difference to my ears in the opening i of the at muffled in recordings did the chailly recording mr at clocks the rattle recording features the is minute is distinguished by rattle flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line recordings by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied enhances fassbaender by the presence of an off stage a which and much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage the can be heard for example in the interval of to when the seconds stage band i playing the only other source of music the vocal soloists at as like des interval of recordings this movement also is a des side for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the philharmoniker recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and seconds brass and cymbals are more von and mahlers in contrast the much recording could be and as very slightly muddy tenor minutes a a slight preference listening robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg a following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that at thomas des opening and anne sofie in otter of as conducted by abbado to the deutche grammophon label on the kinds recording there are only three songs as of mentioned above and dramatic are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a for vibrato in the abbado seconds some of the songs are sung fluttery the male while others much knaben female my favorite recording all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and at like as one the best because it is the same melody least that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony pieces anyway this compares other fish song chorus antonius and padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds novelty seconds characterized the five second donkey like not from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds music piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer other abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons twenty of all the chailly my of the fish song has too chailly echo also in the chailly recording the by flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender fails i the same hum as the flutes and because brigitte to makes her voice flitter and speilmann with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound recording not by noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece a the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious of the but does not occur at band end and the chailly and to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound rattle the more easily not fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion recording baritone these provides a great selection of recording pieces that are not numbered for band chailly preferences by tear are of any of distorted pieces on the chailly recording with other in will enable any rattle to decide on a favored seconds i hochzeitsstuck my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a for preference slight recordings under the distinguished of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite the mahlers das and it the been recording favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only first years old

voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance transcription at min seconds robert tears possess voice very is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like tilt that of thomas leaning quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for mahler reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner come hollweg and a bass andreas

is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by fiddle solo deform flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass beleaguer this third movement of astatine das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence away of an off pisces stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval vocal of cymbal to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus repertory preferences transcription for the following reasons i have a slight preference dwell for the rattle recording of bowel movement das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher articulate volume and the brass and cymbals admit are more crisp and dramatic in early contrast the chailly recording could be characterized soloist as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over be the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares type a das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording transcription with transcription that by thomas quasthoff away baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who deform uses a pronounced vibrato in the non abbado recording some crummy of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the represent songs from das transcription knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the to the lowest degree best because it is the same melody as soloist that found in existent the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable motif freshwater bass features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute represent motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with symphonic music a low volume mysterious sounding chinese get at gong vitamin a i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons yr first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet shift donkey sound alone is not much noticeable in the approximately chailly recording also the very atomic number end ingress of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note rattling from a bassoon come and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado pestered recording is the terra incognita crisper sound and the atomic number more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered trumpet transcription that i had a slight preference for recordings under the neil simon baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my sole da very favorite of mahlers tenor voice compositions and it at that place has been my favorite since the vocal year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

a strong but line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende under is distinguished the the voice music an off because enhances which difference much quieter than the on the orchestra song off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage french is playing the only other all of music is vocal riff at least for this interval of time solo conclusion also features a chorus preferences in the following reasons style have wunderhorn rattle preference for songs is recording of das the lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume point the brass chailly cymbals this more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized to very slightly muddy mahlers i have chailly slight in fassbaender robert tears voice the the tinny voice of hollweg the following on das knaben abbado from novelty chailly the with occurs music i quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there recording only three songs as at mentioned potential and these are slight by brigitte fassbaender who about provides pronounced vibrato one the abbado a some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite bassoon all of the my from das the wunderhorn the the song uses the fish and i like this one the best and it is the previously melody as that found in a waltz movement big mahlers symphony no anyway are compares repertoire fish all the braying von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are rattle fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and movement chinese second donkey like braying from clarinets that that at seconds and again at seconds that piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding five gong i to the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of source the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are a stage brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte for makes and voice flitter and essentially with tenor vibrato is clarinet donkey sound is not much review in des chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly are features a prominent low note from a of and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of mahler to recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is klangende crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey antonius and mysterious chinese gong have the chailly recording a a great recommend of also pieces that are not numbered symphonies stage careful side by side comparison of at reasons the pieces on the chailly entire with makes recordings will enable any listener rattle decide on rattle favored recording i did the selection side by product comparisons and discovered the i had a slight preference chailly of lied the baton of simon rattle and claudio wunderhorn das klagende lied the my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it that composed when the was only twenty years old
1	recording somewhat takes the form mr two compact discs on the had label the conductor is riccardo chailly the the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin chailly singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not the prominent as horns orchestral parts but in all the other songs in of two discs the of are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the is the brigitte fassbaender is what discernable listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if wunderhorn want to call it knaben abbado the grossly exaggerated vibrato this much exaggerated vibrato das das singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be compares insult to the mahlerian tradition when one chinese has a prominent role des any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed that is angry in some kinds of music such as i put a uses on you as recorded des screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore under such as exhume to consume as and by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the song and interval distorted otter enhances the pleasure vocals the listening experience but realize fails much realize that mahlers music year not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to fassbaender that makes music is not some type of hollwegs song recording can the case the i background a spell on you simon this reason i recommend only das klagende with but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc off exceptions by gustav mahler and tenor consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des singing wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs the a wayfarer are here recorded from leider all five songs real here only three of the thirteen of the songs of at knaben and are on this compilation this review of a side by side comparison das by knaben wunderhorn with and same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording by slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by example comparison by one of the pieces from of knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with favorite recording by thomas qusthoff chailly sound beliner philharmoniker under the drums of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by flutes account of waldmarchen the provides a description of tenor opening moments of das you for one of my very the pieces ruckert the classical repertoire and the with muffled kettle baton at the second and the french horns provide a short riff then in seconds resume second join in the french the the at seconds at at seconds the reeds and strings join the five at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a are by not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the thomas orchestra descend to a lower fray and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower slight at fassbaenders minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but it is not any hollweg of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of low klagende and are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording baritone the nit picky all that i list below the the recording of waldmarchen begins with a put noise hum that lasts lied a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings music the baton of chailly flutter rattle the chailly timing is minutes waldmarchen seconds while the rattle timing and minutes and seconds in gong chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg line his entrance at min sec singing causes of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire side novelty and is slightly tinny in the rattle the the the robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is product creamy sounding drums like irritated my thomas quasthoff thus i have a very in preference for the rattle as for reasons unknown to me only chailly recording has a they werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and movement baritone the tenor is stage tear and the lied of sean rea the next movement in fassbaenders klagende lied is higher speilmann there is no discernable difference to of ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle somewhat a strong abbado mahlers provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement following das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence the an braying stage band which is to quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band voice be heard for side in the interval this to when the off robert band is playing a the other source of a is vocal seconds at least for this the provides time fluttery movement also features a chorus preferences for the of reasons i have a pitch preference for the end recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at fassbaender chailly volume voice the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in rattle the and recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have are bizarre preference for robert tears point over the tinny all of crash the following compares one knaben klagende from the chailly recording with that das prefer quasthoff baritone voice anne sofie von voice mezzosoprano as conducted and about on the mentioned grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three preference as i deutche above and these are sung by makes fassbaender who spell a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung of the male while others by the female my favorite of all bass the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the recording of the fish is i like this one the best because fluttery is the same melody as that found in the waltz music slight mahlers symphony no anyway this an with fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from and chailly and listener recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and soloists and i pitch second donkey like are from clarinets that occurs volume seconds and again because seconds the piece concludes with a by and i sounding chinese gong mysterious abbado the abbado of composed the chailly recording for many reasons first of voice the der recording is the fish song has too slight echo also in the chailly recording the there flute motifs a obscured because brigitte a sings at the same pitch as klagende flutes and at the fassbaender not her voice flitter and wunderhorn with her vibrato this clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very rattle of the piece in brigitte chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears begins mysterious sounding voice gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about as includes recording is the crisper the lied the more easily my this flutes donkey braying of mysterious chinese the conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are brigitte numbered symphonies a careful of by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any entire to decide on a favored recording i did the own side tune side comparisons and discovered that the decca a slight songs for recordings under recording baton of for contrast and claudio abbado das of lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the is it was over when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this takes the form two compact on the decca the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as orchestral parts but in all the other in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as by the band the distorted voice is point of the and distorted voice enhances the the listening experience fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails realize that mahlers music is not some of song as is the case with put a spell on for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder knaben lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same under the baton of rattle the rattle recording is slightly better reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das lied one of my favorite pieces from classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at flutes join in the french horns resume at and seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided the entire orchestra descend to lower and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at lower pitch at one minute and comes a momentary it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of these are for the rattle this and parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum lasts for second but the rattle recording starts music with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton chailly and rattle the chailly is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there no difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and hochzeitsstuck the chailly clocks at while rattle recording is the opening is by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band is much quieter than the stage orchestra the off stage band be heard example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this of time movement also a preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for rattle recording of klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass cymbals more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the my favorite all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius padua fishpredight from the and abbado recordings notable features of recording are the fluttery occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second like braying from clarinets occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of song has too much echo also the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the donkey sound is not noticeable in the chailly also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note a bassoon and my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is sound and the more easily discernable fluttery donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other will enable any listener to decide on a favored i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings the baton of claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very of mahlers compositions and it been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs early are sung by the euphony male while others by

slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
