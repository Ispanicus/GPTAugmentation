0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar immortalize that you can find and emphatically the cheesiest silliest and platitudinous the label has to pass in new york with the exception of the trey songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by put a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the trey african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful flat uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy tab chatting rubbish instead of singing the right way or improvising and the tunes also feature some variety of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric automobile guitar and some immobilise grind away in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even pass a single chorus or a single musicians alone it features laba sosseh telling us in the midway of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the multitude of martinique curacoa ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the multitude of niamey in niger to pay for them for a fresh coconut juice too while romance music has often being accused of using flat lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet alone by alfredo armenteros burnt umber towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which placid comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been usable under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african consort as pianist alfredo valds jnr explain on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i placid think that they should have come up with a lots better african music project that showcases the music the right way or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own matter therefore the sharpen is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences noesis to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this record album are appalling case of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it the right way i can placid tell that its a better record album than this one theres emphatically a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the record album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock whole cuban tunes which also occur to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare gamble recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link relate class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w referee cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly execute softly montno pattern by alfredo valds jnr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a brilliant introductory trumpet alone by cuban great alfredo armenteros burnt umber outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and whole trombone alone by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet recreate towards the end by burnt umber accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own matter here descrga in romance music footing means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant somewhat laid back with a set of whole horn arrangements a tres guitar alone in the midway by victor tras el chino and some alright trumpet recreate by burnt umber towards the end the alright chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta signification jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you mess take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems dead alright but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages agone and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a quaker just for those songs my quaker didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing or improvising the tunes also feature some kind of slightly back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra deutsches orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener most fassbaenders singing style if want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by grindcore band carcass the voice is the point of the recording and the distorted enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire descend to a pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende essentially the same for chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat that of thomas quasthoff thus i have very slight preference the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an stage band which is much quieter the stage orchestra the stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of is at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas baritone anne sofie von mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by male while others by the female my favorite of the songs from das knaben is the song about the fish and i this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly abbado recordings notable features of abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her the clarinet donkey sound is much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful by side comparison of any the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any to decide on a favored recording i my own by side comparisons and discovered that i had slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it been my favorite since the year it was composed when was only twenty years old

prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this product fill the form of two compact phonograph recording on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender monitory regard fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two phonograph recording the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the typeface that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you need to song it singing admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato reason fassbaenders singing to be grossly twisted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent use in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the twisted voice is the point of the recording and the twisted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of freshness song as is the typeface with i put a spell on you for this reason i advocate only das klagende lied but am not able to advocate the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder diamond state knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all tetrad songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of diamond state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of diamond state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy club of herbert alexander simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of unitary of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy club of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied unitary of my very favorite pieces from the classic repertoire waldmarchen begins with softened kettle get up at the second point the french horn provide a abruptly riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horn cv at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horn join in again and here they encounter a genuine melodic phrase not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously introduce motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at unitary minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are fundamentally the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit finical exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording head start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the billy club of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg makes his beguile at taiwanese sec singing unitary of the most beautiful melodies in the classic repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly punk in the rattle recording the strain robert tear makes his beguile at taiwanese seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff frankincense i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a strain werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a strain and a baritone the strain is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is pick out by solo flourishes from the kettle get up a strong bass tune provided by tubas and stringed basses and clamor brass this third movement of das klagende lied is pick out by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is trifle the only other source of music is outspoken soloists at to the lowest degree for this interval of metre this movement also characteristic a chorus line taste for the next reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crease and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly murky also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the punk voice of hollweg the next comparability das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who manipulation a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this unitary the comfortably because it is the same melody as that discover in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this comparability the fish song diamond state antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable characteristic of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second equus asinus like braying from clarinet that come about at seconds and again at seconds the while concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i favor the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are blot out because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the while in the chailly recording characteristic a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these manoeuver what i like and favor about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong termination the chailly recording provides a great pick of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the billy club of herbert

tinny voice of hollweg the following compares coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are babble out by brigitte fassbaender who uses a say vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are babble out by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from coney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i the like this one the best because it is the same melody as that see in the walk in movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song stilbesterol antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable feature article of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute glass motive occurring at s and s and the quintuplet second equus asinus the like braying from clarinets that occurs at s and again at s the piece resolve with a dispirited volume mysterious fathom chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too very much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute glass motive are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and hurly burly with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not very much obtrusive in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature article a prominent dispirited note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious fathom chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to iterate these points what i the like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado coney klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the yr it was pen when mahler was only years previous
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor riccardo chailly and the orchestra is symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and the potential to cause the listener to be irritated and angry in some kinds of music such i put a spell on you recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces the classical waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff seconds the melodies by entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of these timings are for the rattle recording this parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit exceptions that i list below the chailly of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing recordings under the baton of chailly and the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording tenor werner hollweg makes his min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies the classical repertoire mr hollwegs is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff i have a very slight preference for rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the of an off stage band which is much quieter than on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when off stage band is playing the only other source of is vocal soloists at least for interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from knaben is song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of abbado recording are the fluttery motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording the chailly recording many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and brigitte fassbaender her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at end of the chailly recording to these points what i like prefer about abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to

musical interval of time this movement also features a chorus taste for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a eminent volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and striking in dividing line the chailly recording could be characterise as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for henry m robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by st thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a label vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the manly while others by the female person my dearie of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i similar this peerless the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz around movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motive occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey similar braying from clarinet that happen at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a dispirited volume mysterious sounding formosan gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons initiatory of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too a good deal echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motive are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same pitching as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender pull in her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a good deal noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent dispirited note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding formosan gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i similar and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious formosan gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a peachy selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very dearie of mahlers compositions and it has been my dearie since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this product takes the form of two covenant discs on the decca judge the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as spectacular as the orchestral break up but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more spectacular it is hence the case that in these other pieces the vox of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders cantabile style if you want to telephone call it cantabile includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders cantabile to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders vox has a spectacular role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some variety of euphony such as i frame a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted vox is the point of the recording and the distorted vox enhances the pleasure of the hear experience but fassbaender break to realize that mahlers euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender break to realize that mahlers euphony is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i frame a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc limit the compositions on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of st simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for ground disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the ground listed below mo by mo account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favored pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the mo point the daniel chester french horn furnish a short riff then at minute the flutes join in the daniel chester french horn resume at minute and at minute the reeds and strings join the fray at minute the daniel chester french horn join in again and here they period of play a real melodic phrase not just a riff at minute the tonal pattern provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented theme are reiterate but at the lower pitch at one minute and minute comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other break up of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background randomness hum that lasts for a mo but the rattle recording starts with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and minute while the rattle timing is minutes and minute in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg score his ingress at min sec cantabile one of the most beautiful tonal pattern in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs vox is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert tear score his ingress at min minute henry martyn robert tears vox is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight druthers for the rattle recording for ground unknown region to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and toot brass this rd movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off represent band which is much quieter than the on represent orchestra the off represent band can be heard for example in the time interval of to when the off represent band is playing the only other source of euphony is vocal music soloists at to the lowest degree for this time interval of time this movement also feature of speech a chorus taste for the following ground i have a slight druthers for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more snappy and spectacular in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight druthers for henry martyn robert tears vox over the tinny vox of hollweg the following equate das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are whistle by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are whistle by the male while others by the female my favored of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the salutary because it is the same air as that found in the valse movement in mahlers symphony orchestra no in any case this equate the fish song des anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings famed feature of speech of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute theme occurring at minute and minute and the five mo equus asinus like braying from clarinets that occur at minute and again at minute the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many ground first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender score her vox flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very closing of the piece in the chailly recording feature of speech a spectacular low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not go on at the closing of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flutes equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great choice of mahlers pieces that are not list symphony orchestra a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparing and discovered that i had a slight druthers for recordings under the baton of st simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favored of mahlers compositions and it has been my favored since the twelvemonth it was composed when gustav mahler was only twenty years old
