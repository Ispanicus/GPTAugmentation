0	ida presti and her husband alexandre lagoya formed what has been called the greatest duo in the history of the classical guitar they were to the duo what segovia was to the solo instrument they innovated technically and musically and made something like fifteen world tours inspiring nearly all the best modern composers to write for the medium while at the same time generating an entire new

unequalled until the advent of todays assad brothers its hard to pick a highlight but one such must certainly be the astonishing chaconne in g major by handel consisting of variations on a ground bass
